Photograph: Michaela Handrek-RehleBloombergOpening hours at Covid-19 vaccination centres are to be extended and the 15-minute observation period after a person receives a jab is to be shelved in order to address the rising threat of the Omicron variant, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has said.In a significant acceleration of the booster programme, the Health Service Executive (HSE) told GPs and pharmacies it will be providing immediate support to allow them meet a likely surge in demand.It came as Mr Donnelly agreed with a suggestion that the impact of the Omicron variant on hospitals could be as bad or worse than the post-Christmas surge last year, with preliminary modelling showing the situation is “very stark”.Dr Denis McCauley, chairman of the GP committee of the Irish Medical Organisation, has said removing the requirement for people to wait 15 minutes after vaccination would allow GPs to double the number of patients they could give boosters to.The change came as GPs were told they can start administering booster vaccines to all adults, though they should continue to prioritise older and more vulnerable patients.In a statement Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said that the measures would assist the HSE in achieving “maximum delivery” of vaccines and included:Mr Donnelly said that Ireland has continued to be a frontrunner in the delivery and uptake of Covid-19 vaccines internationally.“With over 1.2 million booster doses administered to date, we are currently operating an advanced hybrid model of delivery in Ireland to ensure those who are most vulnerable to Covid-19 are further protected. In advance of the festive season, I have asked that the HSE update the programme to maximise delivery. It is the intention that we will deliver an average of 300,000 booster doses a week in the coming weeks,” he said.“I am also pleased to announce that vulnerable children aged 5-11 will begin to be offered an appointment from next week and the booster programme will commence offering appointments to those aged 40-49 on the week commencing 27th December.”Mr Donnelly told RTÉ News on Wednesday that the Government had sought guidance from the National Immunisation Advisory Committee on the observation period matter and the group recommended it be shelved.“The recommendation to me is that we waive that 15 minutes and I have accepted that recommendation,” he said. “Particularly for our GPs and pharmacists, they signalled it would be very useful in terms of being able to vaccinate more people.“It’s something we looked at again with the impending threat of Omicron, to just get as many people boosted as possible.”On reaching a target of 300,000 jabs a week, Mr Donnelly said: “Next week is slightly different in that people will be taking a few days off. We’re only closing the vaccine centres for two days: Christmas Day and St Stephen’s Day.“The GPs and pharmacists will need to take a bit of time off, so next week is unusual in that way, but essentially what we are doing now is deploying so that we can get to 300,000 per week and keep growing from there.”On extended opening hours for vaccine centres, he said: “It’s about opening them as long as possible, adding new centres, there may be pop-up centres and basically getting the volume, for every hour they’re open, up.”He said opening hours are different for each centre and people should also check when walk-in centres are opening in their counties.Expanded rolloutAt present, boosters are being administered to people aged 50 and over, residents of nursing homes and long-term care facilities and those aged 16 and over with an underlying condition or who work in health.Under new rules, the HSE has told GPs they may now “in next order of priority” offer boosters to pregnant women aged 16 and over, people aged 40-49 years and people aged 16-39 years in descending order by 10-year age cohort (30-39, 20-29 and 16-19 years).A similar letter was sent to pharmacies on Wednesday but was later recalled by the HSE. A spokesman said it had been sent out to pharmacies in error.GPs have been told they can move down to younger age groups once they have administered vaccines to their 50-59-year-old patients, he said.A revised letter sent to the sector tells pharmacies to administer boosters to the over-50s, healthcare workers, people with underlying conditions and pregnant women, but makes no mention of younger age groups.GPs offering booster doses are to set aside routine work for the next two weeks as part of the plans to accelerate the rollout, according to Dr McCauley. Doctors will continue to deal with urgent cases.HSE managers are due to contact inidual GP surgeries and pharmacies over the coming days to ensure they have sufficient stocks.Deliveries of extra supplies are expected to take place from Friday up to Thursday, December 23rd.Pharmacies have been told they can have a “one-off unscheduled delivery” to provide them with sufficient stocks to last 30 days.Family doctors have been told they can vaccinate all adults while “at all times trying to prioritise the medically vulnerable and the older age groups as much as is practical”, according to Dr McCauley.Urging people to put a booster “on their Christmas list”, he said patients should check with the website of their practice for an update on how to access a shot. Some patients would be contacted by their doctor but others may be able to make online appointments.‘Stark situation’In relation to the possibility of new restrictions being introduced to curb the spread of the Omicron variant, Mr Donnelly said the Government would wait to hear the advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet).“What we know about this variant so far is very sobering,” he said. “We know it is far more transmissible than Delta. We know it is still making people sick. There is a question as to how severe it is in terms of hospitalisations, but we certainly are taking it very seriously.”He was asked about comments by the English chief medical officer Chris Whitty that suggested the impact on hospitalisations will to be as bad if not worse than last winter and if Nphet modelling predicts a similar impact here. Mr Donnelly replied: “We could well see that, yes.”He said that Prof Philip Nolan provided some preliminary modelling on Tuesday night “and the reality is the situation is very stark with Omicron”.Mr Donnelly said he didn’t have the exact figures with him for how many cases per day are being predicted by Nphet’s preliminary modelling, but said the ranges are “very, very wide”.“Based on what we’re seeing in the UK, it’s reasonable to assume that we are looking at a very high number of cases in the coming weeks,” he added.Mr Donnelly declined to offer an opinion on how severe any new restrictions recommended by Nphet will be, saying “it wouldn’t be helpful for me to speculate now”.It was put to Mr Donnelly that it will frighten elderly people that the modelling could be similar to last year. He replied: “Let me be very clear – when you were asking me is it potentially similar to last year in terms of the number of cases, yes, it could well be.“It could be more in terms of the number of hospitalisations. Yes, that is entirely possible.“The huge difference to last year is the vaccines and the boosters.”He said: “Ireland has the highest level of vaccination for people over 60, 70, 80, anywhere in Europe. We’re also seeing a really strong response to the booster programme as well.“So the level of protection that is being afforded by the two primary doses, but also by the booster, is absolutely huge.”He encouraged anyone in older age groups that haven’t got their booster jab to get one.Mr Donnelly also said that the “working hypothesis” is that the booster “significantly increases protection against severe illness” including Omicron cases.In relation to Omicron, Mr Donnelly said: “There are some things we still don’t know, some really important questions like how much severe illness in terms of hospitalisations and those who end up in critical care.“Obviously mortality is one of the things we just don’t know yet but there are things we do know which are serious. We know that it is far more transmissible than Delta. And we can see the evidence obviously in the UK now reporting their highest cases.”‘Tired but willing’Dr McCauley said doctors were “tired but willing” to do their bit to ensure as many people get a booster as possible.Booster shots are being offered in 700 pharmacies this week, up from 550 last week and 470 the week before. This is still short of the 1,000 pharmacies that took part in the original vaccine rollout, but Darragh O’Loughlin, secretary general of the Irish Pharmacy Union (IPU), said he hoped to match this number early in the new year. There are about 1,900 pharmacies in the State.Earlier IT issues that prevented communications between the databases of people vaccinated in pharmacies and those attending HSE vaccination centres have been resolved, Mr O’Loughlin said. Information about a person receiving a booster in a pharmacy is now transferred to the HSE system within minutes so duplication of effort is avoided.Pharmacies administered 10,000 boosters on Tuesday, and 45,000 last week, up from 17,500 two weeks earlier.December is the busiest time of the year for pharmacies, he pointed out, and outlets will continue to dispense prescriptions while also administering booster shots.The IPU has asked the Department of Health to allow pharmacy students administer vaccines as part of the acceleration of the programme.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"omicron variant is spreading at unprecedented rate who chief says","story":"The Omicron variant has now been reported by 77 countries and is probably present in most worldwide World Health Organisation (WHO) director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said.  Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organisation, says Omicron should not be dismissed as ‘mild’. File photograph: Martial TrezziniEPAThe Omicron variant first detected in South Africa last month has now been reported by 77 countries and is probably present in most worldwide, but should not be dismissed as “mild”, World Health Organisation (WHO) director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said. “Omicron is spreading at a rate we have not seen with any previous variant,” the WHO director general told an online briefing on Tuesday. “Even if Omicron does cause less severe disease, the sheer number of cases could once again overwhelm unprepared health systems.”Vaccine booster shots can play a role in curbing the spread of Covid-19 as long as people most in need of protection also get access to jabs, he also said.Also on Tuesday, global public health expert Dr Mike Ryan of the WHO said that the world cannot vaccinate or lock down its way out of the Covid-19 pandemic.The executive director of the WHO’s health emergencies programme said continued public health measures were required as the Omicron variant would put pressure on health services, even if it was a milder disease.Speaking at an online webinar organised by the Institute of International and European Affairs, Dr Ryan said people have been looking for “silver bullets” or “unicorns” to end the pandemic, but they “don’t exist”.He said there needed to be a “multi-pronged” approach, in which consistent advice is delivered to the public.“What has worked during this pandemic is layered, risk-orientated, evidence-based, consistent advice to people. That’s the only way out of it. We can’t vaccinate our way out of this. We can’t lock down our way out of this,” he said.Dr Ryan said some countries have moved away from the basic health measures such as social distancing, hand-washing and mask-wearing.“Even if Omicron turns out to be a milder disease on an inidual basis, if we generate millions and millions and millions of cases, we will fill the hospitals up. We will fill the ICUs up,” he said.“We need to refocus on public health and social measures, vaccinate the unvaccinated. We need to make sure hospitals are ready.”Boosters should be administered to specific groups within the population, particularly older persons and people with underlying conditions.However, he said it was important to do both boosters and getting those who are unvaccinated vaccinated as quickly as possible.“That is the best use of the vaccine,” he added.Equitable accessOn the issue of equitable access for vaccines, Dr Ryan spoke about the Trips (Trade-related aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) waiver, which would temporarily waive patent rights to facilitate more widespread manufacturing worldwide.He said waiving technology rights “doesn’t necessarily make vaccines”, but said it must be viewed as a “global, strategic effort”.The WHO’s target was to have 40 per cent of the world vaccinated by the end of this year, but it is way off that, he said.“If a fire brigade goes to a fire today, it doesn’t distribute water on the basis of who can pay. It distributes that water based on whose house is burning, whose house is most at risk. We need a system that is much more coherent and we need technology transfer,” he said.Speaking in response to arguments that waiving the rights would have a negative impact on vaccine innovation in the future, Dr Ryan said it was public money that drove most of the investment.“There are extraordinary circumstances in which we really have to look at patents and intellectual property. When the patent for seatbelts was shared, Volvo didn’t go out of business,” he added.

He said the use of unclaimed prizes to fund promotion is monitored by the National Lottery regulator.Mr Algeo was appearing before the committee to answer questions on how no one has one the main jackpot since early June. The current jackpot, which stands at €19 million, has been capped since October.“Given the tickets purchased since early June, the chances are akin to rolling a die 37 times without the number six arising,” Mr Algeo said.The rollover continues for a 51st time as there was no winner of the main draw on Wednesday. The winning numbers were 4, 10,21,27,41,42 and the bonus number was 18. Mr Algeo announced plans to seek regulatory approval for a rule change which would allow for must-win draws after a certain period of time.He said the company was proposing that a draw would have to be won, if not by someone who matched all six numbers then by someone who matched five.Lottery Regulator Carol Boate told the committee her office is currently examining this proposal. She told politicians that the Lottery has be run according to the rules, despite the unusually large number of rollovers, and that “statistically unlikely events are part of nature of lotteries.”Mr Algeo refused to detail the sales figures for tickets since the rollovers started, saying that the data must first be audited. He said “sales of the lotto product have been higher normal in the last four months. I don’t think I can say anything more than that.”The former Paddy Power executive also refused to say how much PIL has spent on promotions or advertising so far this year. Fine Gael TD Neale Richmond said it is “obvious” that advertising has increased, but Mr Algeo would not be drawn on the issue.He said PIL has internal teams which work on advertising and marketing and that it also hires outside companies.The use of unclaimed prizes in the promotional budget is stipulated by PIL’s licence, he said. The regulator, Ms Boate, said this is not an unusual arrangement.Mr Algeo said advertising increases ticket sales which in turn creates money for good causes. He said the value of unclaimed prizes fell last year, from €20 million to €17 million, and that for the first time it accounted for less than two per cent of sales.Fine Gael TD Bernard Durkan asked what protections are in place to protect people who may have a gambling problem.Mr Algeo responded that there are “extensive protections” in place and that games “are designed with player safety in mind.”He said advertising conforms to the Advertising Standards of Ireland (ASAI) code and PIL’s own internal code and that online spending on its products is monitored.Mr Durkan also raised the possibility of the Lottery being “hacked” in a similar fashion to the HSE cyberattack in May. Ms Boate said she commissioned an expert report last year into cybersecurity measures surrounding the Lottery. On receipt of this report last March, she said she was confident PIL is taking “all appropriate steps” to protect against a cyberattack.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn f%C3%A9in td would seek to convince unionists on all island health cooperation","story":"Mr Cullinane said he understands that more cross border cooperation is “anathema” to some unionist politicians.David Cullinane would seek to convince a Unionist counterpart in the north that increased all-island cooperation on health “makes sense” if he was appointed minister in a future government involving Sinn Féin.Mr Cullinane said he understands that more cross border cooperation is “anathema” to some unionist politicians.However he said: “we have to go and make the reasoned argument that this makes sense for children in Belfast… or for adults across different areas like cancer care”.Mr Cullinane said that from his contacts with doctors in the North “they want to see more integrated healthcare on the island - they get it”.He said: “They’re up for this, they want it to happen.

From January 1st, Britain plans to make its goods border with the European Union similar to those with the rest of the world, with extra customs checks and a pre-notification requirement for some goods. As Brexit minister David Frost noted in a written statement to the House of Lords on Wednesday, implementing the arrangements for goods moving from the island of Ireland is particularly complex. The Northern Ireland protocol and British legislation guarantee “unfettered access” for goods moving from the North to England, Scotland or Wales.Full border controls on goods coming to Britain from the Republic could encourage southern traders to reroute their goods through Northern ports. The British authorities, already struggling to meet the January 1st deadline for new border controls with mainland Europe, have yet to devise a system to distinguish between goods from the North and the Republic arriving in Britain from Northern Irish ports. Frost said the current arrangements would continue for as long as discussions on the protocol were still going on, confirming that the negotiations would not be finished by the end of this month. He presented the delay as a “pragmatic act of good will” that can help to maintain space for continued negotiations. Frost’s tone reflects a lowering of the temperature between London and Brussels, and both sides are focused on finding agreement on the protocol’s practical difficulties. British statements continue to mention that triggering article 16 remains an option, but in a ritualistic rather than a threatening way, and the Europeans have toned down their threats of terrible retaliation. MedicinesThere could be an agreement on access to medicines in Northern Ireland by Christmas, something that will require the EU to change its own rules. Both sides are aiming for an agreement early in the new year on the other practical issues, including customs and sanitary and phytosanitary checks. A senior British official said last week that if the negotiations fail it would not be because Britain was insisting on removing the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) from the protocol. Downing Street later distanced itself from the official’s characterisation of the shift in its position, saying that any durable solution would have to address the protocol’s governance. But there was no denial of the assertion that the ECJ has been dropped as an issue in the current negotiations or that it is no longer a deal-breaker. That makes an agreement early in the new year a real possibility, and Wednesday’s announcement will further improve the atmosphere around the talks.

Costermongers hawk their wares children stare at huge lollipops in the grocer’s window alongside piles of potted jams and pickles gaily striped awnings protect the butcher’s meats from the sun the sweet smell of bread escapes from the baker’s open door the inn advertises, in large gold-leafed letters, that “Ales, Stout \u0026amp Porter” are for sale. Market stalls, horse dung, water troughs, gently curving Georgian bay windows thick with a century’s encrusted paint. All life is here.A nostalgic memory? Undoubtedly. But for many a painful one. In too many high streets the current reality is one of no homes, fewer shops and scarce businesses. Many lovely Victorian and early 20th century shops are in desperate peril.The Victorian Society’s top 10 endangered buildings list includes a Peckham department store and a Stoke-on-Trent indoor market. Just last month, Westminster council shamefully gave M\u0026ampS permission to demolish its beautiful 1930 Oxford Street branch to replace it with a tedious and unvarying grid of identical windows. We can call this “spreadsheet architecture”.These buildings are universally lamented as soon as they are lost, but somehow it carries on happening. Nobody argues that our towns are improved by their loss. Nobody argues that it is more environmentally friendly to replace them rather than refurbish them. And yet these buildings continue to go.We can, however, go some way towards correcting this horrific trend. The aftermath of the pandemic, which has exacerbated the crumbling of traditional high street infrastructure, has given us an opportunity.Vanishingly few early 20th century traditional buildings are listed by Historic England, trapped by a definition of “architectural significance” that regards architectural history as a fast train to modernism. No specialised body exists whose heart is in the fight for these lovely buildings with their rich stylistic range: Bankers’ Georgian, Deco, Classical, Néo-Grec, Renaissance, and so on. So let us empower those who have the capacity to take this task on.We should then adapt the VAT system, which is biased in favour of new builds versus renovation. This particularly matters in “left behind” towns where most incentives are to let high streets rot and restart elsewhere. The Government should make it VAT-free to bring derelict buildings back into use or charge a reduced rate of 5 per cent.Most importantly, we should let high streets come back to complex life again as agreeable places where people live and work as well as shop.Internet shopping is here to stay, but thanks to welcome innovations over the past decade, mechanisms exist which councils could use to make it easier for owners to invest in converting buildings for other uses. None are fully taking the opportunity, nervous of ceding control.A flourishing high street is an attractive place where people wish to live, to meet, to converse, to buy, to sell and to be amused. We cannot go back to the 1890s but there’s nothing to stop future high streets being even better.

Last year, amid the capital’s 11th hour lockdown, it was here that she celebrated, without a turkey or even a tree. Now she’s determined to escape the city – with or without omicron.“I haven’t seen my aunts and uncles in two years. Not long before the pandemic, we lost my grandparents and we haven’t been able to gather as a family since,” she says.Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, famously referred to the young as “vehicles of spread” and for London’s 20- and 30-somethings the past few weeks have been excruciating. “Every conversation is about someone we know who has tested positive,” says Johnny, 24. He’s had three close calls in as many days – a friend from a pub trip on Saturday, a cousin he met for Sunday lunch and his flatmate’s girlfriend all have Covid.“It’s the realisation that if I take this home for Christmas, I am signing a death warrant for my grandparents – at least that’s how it feels,” he says. “I’ve 100 per cent changed my behaviour. But I don’t know if it’s too late.”This is the London conundrum: go out and enjoy the run up to Christmas, or play it safe and reduce the risk of killing gran. It’s not just youngsters many older Londoners who have family outside the city are facing the same dilemma. But it’s millennials and Gen Z – those who are most likely to have been socialising since the start of the month – who are particularly stressed.“Yesterday and Monday were two of the most anxious days I’ve had in my life,” says Sasha, 27. On Saturday night she went to a small party just south of the river. Everyone was vaccinated but eight of the 18 party-goers have since been “omicronned” Sasha’s positive test arrived on Tuesday. In a way, it was a relief. “I now have to isolate for 10 days and I have a date to re-enter society – Christmas Eve. But I’m still terrified of taking Covid home for Christmas. How do I know if I’m still infectious?”​​Andy Bell, deputy chief executive of the Centre for Mental Health, says young people are being hit with an “oppressive sense of anxiety” around Christmas. “Young people have had their mental health impacted by the pandemic more than any other age group, that’s consistent in all surveys,” he told the . “And now they are experiencing a sense of powerlessness and uncertainty around Christmas too – they’re not sure what the right thing to do is.”The Christmas conundrum is not just a stress on a personal level. From an epidemiological perspective it’s a nightmare. London is not just the biggest city in the UK – and one which famously empties to every nook and corner of the country at Christmas – it is also the epicentre of the current outbreak. Government scientists estimate there were 300,000 to 400,000 new omicron infections across Britain on Wednesday, and the centre of the outbreak is London – where 40 per cent of England’s confirmed omicron cases have so far been detected. Case numbers are doubling every couple of days, the rise being so steep that even logarithmic charts no longer work well enough to properly gauge its trajectory. On Wednesday the capital reported an all-time-record, with 19,294 new cases – up 176 per cent compared with last Wednesday. For the UK as a whole, there were nearly 79,000 cases recorded, the highest since the pandemic began.London also has the lowest vaccination uptake, with the number of people without a single shot three times higher than in England as a whole. The 14 areas with the lowest vaccination rates are all in London boroughs, with some postcodes as low as 39 per cent. This is bad news, says virologist Prof Jonathan Ball, because it means omicron will “find its way into vulnerable people more easily”. Yet even as omicron envelops the capital, it remains deeply unfashionable to so much as wonder aloud if it might be a good idea to somehow control the virus.Ever since Freedom Day on July 19, the unspoken but widely adopted formulation for scientists and health officials is to be agnostic on the subject of restrictions, saying only that it is “a matter for ministers”. Even Imperial College’s Prof Neil Ferguson (better known now as Professor Lockdown) has long since stopped calling for restrictions – openly at least. We face a “very explosive wave of infection” he told the  on Friday. “The omicron wave could very substantially overwhelm the NHS, getting up to peak levels of admissions of 10,000 people per day.” But you don\u0027t need to read far into the minutes of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) to see tough choices the Prime Minister will need to grapple with over the next few days.“It is highly likely that there will be a change in contact patterns over the festive period,” noted the scientists of the SPI-M-O subgroup of Sage noted on Nov 24.The overall number of contacts between people may fall over Christmas. But – and it’s a big but – “there is typically increased mixing across generations and between networks that may not normally meet” during the festive period. “This is accompanied by activities, such as increased shopping or work parties, as well as increased travel across the country,” the report said.It was only in September that some were saying the Covid epidemic in England had “de facto ended” but now it\u0027s lockdown that some are saying is “de facto back”.Rachel, 26, was meant to move into a new flat with her boyfriend this week in Putney. Instead the pair are isolating with another couple in a small two bedroom flat in South London, after they all tested positive.“We were going to visit my sister in Vienna for Christmas but I won’t come out of isolation soon enough now, so that’s all been cancelled,” she says. “It just sort of feels like a kind of de facto lockdown, despite having a vaccine. The government hasn\u0027t sorted it\u0027s booster programme well. It’s quite frustrating.”There is worry among older generations too. Parents and grandparents all over the country are concerned about their children – and whether it\u0027s a good idea to invite them in.“My daughter couldn’t come home last year because of the London lockdown, and it broke my heart,” says Mary, 65. “My own parents had died in a short space from one another, and I was so looking forward to spending some family time together.”The family had an argument over Christmas plans last weekend, one of many happening up and down the country. “I snapped at her when she told me she was going into the office with hundreds of others,” Mary says. “She said it was out of her control, and I think I said she was being selfish. This year, I really want her back.”Working out whether to mix this Christmas is far from easy – not least because so much depends on people’s personal tolerance for risk.Nevertheless, we are in an entirely different position to last year: 69 per cent of the UK population have had two doses of a vaccine, the total rising to 75 per cent if you include those who have had at least one jab. In addition, 42 per cent of those eligible have had a booster.But how much protection will they give? This is the million dollar question. Evidence shows pretty clearly that three shots are now needed to maintain the protection against infection that a double dose previously provided.The best evidence to date on severe disease comes from South Africa, where on Tuesday it was reported that vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation with omicron was 70 per cent – compared with 93 per cent against delta. This is good on an inidual level – and above the World Health Organisation’s benchmark of 50 per cent – but not great on a population level if hospital beds are in short supply.This week NHS bosses again had to order local hospital trusts to start discharging patients into care homes, hospices and even hotels in order to clear space for the anticipated wave of omicron patients to come.Experts warn we should interpret the South African data with caution. It is early days yet in the outbreak and their population is much younger than our own.“I think the most concerning thing right now is the very rapid increase in the number of cases,” says Troels Lillebæk, chair of the Danish Sars-Cov-2 variant risk assessment group. “Soon it will become less significant whether omicron is as dangerous as delta, because if you exceed a certain number of cases every day there will be a huge strain on the healthcare system.”The bottom line is that there is no easy answer. Experts say the best way to reduce stress over Christmas is to talk about it “sooner rather than later” and to listen carefully to what your friends and relatives are saying – taking care to read between the lines.“It’s chipping away at young people – particularly where you have family members who are high risk, vulnerable, or people in overcrowded accommodation,” Bell says. “Because the situation is moving so much, people don’t know where they stand. Open communication is really important.”Sage, not known for its touchy feely side, takes a different tack and stresses the importance of regular testing to reduce your festive risk.Echoing the “know your status” mantra of the HIV pandemic, it notes: “Lateral flow testing can be used as a group diagnostic to mitigate risk of Sars-Cov-2 transmission into older age groups and more vulnerable iniduals”.Millions of Londoners – and many in the homes they are heading to – will be hoping for just one festive red line on those tests this Christmas. Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health SecurityMore from NewsScale back your Christmas plans, say Boris Johnson and Chris WhittyPCR testing labs ‘likely to be overwhelmed within days’ amid pre-Christmas rise in demandBoris is dooming Britain to a dismal cycle of never-ending lockdownsPharmacies accuse NHS of \u0026#39tactical error\u0026#39 for rejecting help with Covid booster vaccinationsBlow for Boris Johnson as all six leaders of 1922 Committee join rebellion against Covid passportsI will reform system giving violent criminals ‘perverse’ protection, says Dominic RaabMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"national trust puts woke agenda bed choice new non political","story":"The National Trust has announced the charity boss who oversaw the RSPCA climb-down from its “politicised” role as its new chairman amid attempts to calm rows with members.René Olivieri, an American who has held several non-executive roles in the cultural and natural heritage sector, will take up the post in February and is seen as a “safe pair of hands” both inside and outside the charity, the Daily  understands.He will stay on at his role as chairman of the RSPCA, where earlier this year he oversaw the decision to step back from private prosecutions which had caused clashes between the charity and MPs and ministers over its “political” role.The National Trust has seen similar clashes with both members and politicians over its so-called “woke agenda” and “politicised” move away from the organisation’s core objectives of protecting the nation’s heritage.Tim Parker, the last chairman, announced his decision to quit in May just 24 hours after the concerns saw members campaign group Restore Trust set out plans to force him out at October’s AGM.Mr Olivieri has never been publicly involved in any political rows or commented on the so-called “culture wars” which have prompted criticism of the Trust’s current leadership.In January last year, Boris Johnson appointed him the interim chairman of the National Lottery Heritage Fund and he has served as a member of both the Culture Recovery Fund Board and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport’s Cultural and Heritage Capital Advisory Board.As part of his appointment to the Lottery position, Mr Olivieri had to declare that he had taken part in no significant political activity in the last five years.Whilst Restore Trust has yet to comment publicly on the appointment, they had been calling for the position to go to an outsider with knowledge of running a large organisation and the “absence of current active association with any political party”.As well as experience in heritage, Mr Olivieri, 68, has a long history of fighting climate change, seen as one of the key priorities of the Trust’s leadership.On announcement of his appointment, he said that the 126-year-old charity is “uniquely placed to recognise the debt to the generations that have gone before and its responsibility to those which follow”.“I believe the National Trust is the body that makes essential connections in our world, between the past and future, nature and heritage and between people from all parts of society,” he said.“We must all work together to preserve and promote our heritage while taking climate action and restoring nature.“I want to ensure the National Trust, which is privileged to be able to take such a long view, plays a leading role in realising these ambitions.”Mr Olivieri, who was born in the US, is said to have developed a passion for the UK’s heritage and the impact that it can have on communities when he moved to the country more than 30 years ago.He lives with his wife Anne in Moreton Hall, a Grade II listed Georgian house in rural Worcestershire, where they open their gardens to the public and donate all the proceeds to the Royal Shakespeare Company.Alongside taking on charitable roles Mr Olivieri has been delivering “courses on innovation, business models and cultural change for senior executives in both commercial and non-profit organisations”, his biography on the Government’s website reveals.He was previously chief executive of Blackwell Publishing for 20 years, standing down after it was acquired by a US rival in 2007. He has since served as chairman of the Tubney Charitable and the Wildlife Trusts.Hilary McGrady, the Trust’s director general, said she was “delighted” at the appointment, adding: “We have the same ambition: to give as many people as possible access to the incredible collections, houses, land and coastline that we care for on behalf of England, Wales and Northern Ireland.More from NewsAJ Odudu could miss Strictly Come Dancing final as injury leaves her on crutchesScale back your Christmas plans, say Boris Johnson and Chris WhittyPCR testing labs ‘likely to be overwhelmed within days’ amid pre-Christmas rise in demandBoris is dooming Britain to a dismal cycle of never-ending lockdownsPharmacies accuse NHS of \u0026#39tactical error\u0026#39 for rejecting help with Covid booster vaccinationsBlow for Boris Johnson as all six leaders of 1922 Committee join rebellion against Covid passportsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"not so merry christmas festive shoppers switch alcohol free","story":"The champagne will be flowing less freely on Christmas day this year as households are shunning alcohol in favour of healthier alternatives.Repeated lockdowns have taken their toll on the nation’s liver but retailers said that households were now being more mindful about the dangers of problem drinking and stocking up on low and no-alcohol drinks ahead of Christmas.Waitrose said that sales of no and low-alcohol drinks have risen by 29 per cent this month, compared to December last year. The trend is being driven by alternative spirits, sales of which increased by 38 per cent. No and low alcohol wine sales are up 29 per cent and beer 26 per cent.  A spokesman for the supermarket said: We\u0027re seeing our customers opting for no and low-alcohol options more than ever this festive season and many people are looking for ways to embrace moderation by taking a much more flexitarian approach to their drink choices. This might mean enjoying a glass of fizz at a Christmas party but then moving onto a lowno option for the rest of the evening.Sainsbury’s have seen a 91 per cent increase in sales in this category. The supermarket said that this was partly down to a big rise in the number of products on offer. The market for alcohol free spirits was once dominated by more expensive premium products but its range now includes cheaper alternatives that start at £12.The drinks analysts ISWR expect the market for no and low alcohol drinks to rise by 22 per cent from 2019 to 2024. Mintel, the market research company, said that the market was forecast to grow by a fifth to £171 million this year.It said that consumers were cutting back on their alcohol intake after over-indulging during the pandemic. In a survey of consumers it found that cutbacks on alcohol intake once the pandemic is over are planned by 16 per cent of people who drink standard, low- or non-alcoholicalcohol-free drinksAngharad Goode, Mintel food and drinks analyst said: “The low- and no-alcohol drinks market is well-placed to gain users as a result of the Covid-19coronavirus outbreak, as health takes a more central stage in people’s food and drink considerations. There are many areas for brands to expand into to tempt consumers, whether it’s by offering drinks recipes or smaller formats, however taste is the key to ensuring user retention.”Alcohol Change UK said that a record number of people have signed up to take part in Dry January this year in a sign that people are addressing worrying habits they may have picked up during the pandemic.Lucy Holmes, director of research and policy at the charity said: Our research shows that a significant number of people say they drank more this year compared to 2020 and that\u0027s unnerving for some, with pubs and restaurants closed, people were asking themselves why am I at home drinking on my own? So they are gearing up for a healthier 2022 and getting it under control.More from NewsAJ Odudu could miss Strictly Come Dancing final as injury leaves her on crutchesScale back your Christmas plans, say Boris Johnson and Chris WhittyPCR testing labs ‘likely to be overwhelmed within days’ amid pre-Christmas rise in demandBoris is dooming Britain to a dismal cycle of never-ending lockdownsPharmacies accuse NHS of \u0026#39tactical error\u0026#39 for rejecting help with Covid booster vaccinationsBlow for Boris Johnson as all six leaders of 1922 Committee join rebellion against Covid passportsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"omicron spreads 70 times faster airways delta 10 times slower","story":"Omicron multiplies 70 times faster in the airways than delta yet replicates 10 times more slowly in the lungs, which may explain why it is very transmissible but less severe, scientists have said.Researchers at the University of Hong Kong studied how quickly the virus replicates in bronchial and lung tissue in the lab.They discovered that the virus was capable of replicating far faster in the bronchus - the tubes that attach the windpipe to the lungs - with more infection present after just 24 hours than delta produced after two days.However, the research showed the virus struggled to reproduce efficiently in lung tissue, which may explain why people are experiencing cold-like symptoms, but few cases are progressing to serious disease.Dr Michael Chan Chi-wai, the principal investigator, said the research may suggest omicron is less severe, but warned that a very transmissible variant could lead to more deaths, even if it was milder. “It is important to note that the severity of disease in humans is not determined only by virus replication but also by the host immune response to the infection, which may lead to dysregulation of the innate immune system, such as a cytokine storm,” said Dr Chan. “It is also noted that, by infecting many more people, a very infectious virus may cause more severe disease and death even though the virus itself may be less pathogenic. “Therefore, taken together with our recent studies showing that the omicron variant can partially escape immunity from vaccines and past infection, the overall threat from the omicron variant is likely to be very significant.”On Wednesday, Dr Meaghan Kall, an epidemiologist at the UK Health Security Agency, said that care homes and hospital wards were seeing 50 to 80 per cent of people infected - levels not seen since before the vaccination programme began. But she added: “They are mostly asymptomatic and mild infections. I remain optimistic about omicron being milder.“I think there’s cause for concern, but it hinges on how vaccines hold up against severe disease. And we don’t have much solid evidence on that.”So far, despite a surge in cases, there have currently been just 11 people admitted to hospital with confirmed omicron, five suspected cases and just one death.Commenting on the Hong Kong study, Dr Muge Cevik, an infectious diseases researcher from the University of St Andrews, said: “For those asking whether this is good or bad news, simple answer: I don’t know. While omicron may infect the lung cells less efficiently, a higher viral load may worsen immune response. “The only thing I am sure of is that omicron will spread so quickly through the population, making it likely impossible to contain even with the most stringent measures and giving us very little time over the next few weeks. So get your vaccines and boosters.”In South Africa, which has seen a large wave of omicron, there have also been far fewer deaths than previous waves. The first major real-world study into the new variant published by South African scientists earlier this week found the variant is likely to be 23 per cent less severe than delta with vaccines still offering good protectionA study of more than 78,000 omicron cases in South Africa recorded between November 15 and December 7, also found that the Pfizer jab still offers 70 per cent protection against hospitalisation after two doses.The research showed that compared with the first Wuhan strain, the virus led to 29 per cent fewer admissions to hospital, with 23 per cent fewer hospital admissions compared to delta.Far fewer people also needed intensive care from omicron, with just five per cent of cases admitted to intensive care units compared with 22 per cent of delta patients. More from NewsAJ Odudu could miss Strictly Come Dancing final as injury leaves her on crutchesScale back your Christmas plans, say Boris Johnson and Chris WhittyPCR testing labs ‘likely to be overwhelmed within days’ amid pre-Christmas rise in demandBoris is dooming Britain to a dismal cycle of never-ending lockdownsPharmacies accuse NHS of \u0026#39tactical error\u0026#39 for rejecting help with Covid booster vaccinationsBlow for Boris Johnson as all six leaders of 1922 Committee join rebellion against Covid passportsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"oxford cambridge increasingly shunning pupils eton favour state","story":"Oxford and Cambridge are increasingly shunning pupils from Eton College in favour of children from state schools, new data reveal.Some of the country’s most prestigious private schools are now seeing their Oxbridge offers decline sharply, according to figures obtained by The .Meanwhile, some state schools have seen their offers soar in recent years and are now among the most successful schools at sending pupils to Oxbridge.This newspaper has analysed data from both Oxford and Cambridge universities which show the number of offers they have made to every school over the past five years.Using our interactive graphic, you can now see how many Oxbridge offers pupils at every school in the UK - as well as international schools - have received each year between 2017 and 2021.Click on each school to examine its Oxbridge success rate, which is calculated by working out how many of its pupils’ applications resulted in offers each year. You can also use the search function to look up a particular school and see how they have fared.Eton College is one of just three schools which has seen a decline in Oxbridge offers every year since 2017, as top universities come under mounting pressure to accept more students from disadvantaged backgrounds.The £44,00-a-year boarding school in Windsor has seen its Oxbridge offer plummet by 21 per cent in five years, from 86 in 2016 to 68 in 2021.Eton\u0027s offers are falling even when accounting for the fact fewer of its pupils are now applying to Oxbridge compared to five years ago.

It has seen its Oxbridge offers decline by 50 per cent, from 28 to 14.And Cheltenham Ladies College, a £39,780-a-year girls’ boarding school, has also had a 50 per cent decline in offers, from 26 to 13.Meanwhile, of the 10 schools which have seen the biggest boost in their Oxbridge offers, eight are state schools, the majority of which are selective sixth form colleges based in London.Three schools in the east London borough of Newham - Brampton Manor Academy, London Academy of Excellence and Newham Collegiate Sixth Form - have all seen their offers at least triple over the past five years.King’s College London Mathematics School and Greenhead College in Huddersfield have both doubled their offers over the same period. You can use our geographical search tool to find out the best schools are in your local area for getting pupils into Oxbridge.Simply type in your postcode, and you will get a list of the top 20 schools for Oxbridge offers within a 10-mile radius.One Oxford don said there has been a “constant drip, drip, drip” of pressure to “move the dial” away from private schools and in favour of state school admissions.“The dial hadn’t moved basically for 15 years, there was a lot of talk but not much action,” he said. “But now it is happening, even if it’s just at the margin each year. The message has got through. No one likes to be ordered to do anything but after a while it seeps into the consciousness.“There is also the element that once they have tried and tested the output of Brampton Manor Academy, they think it works, they are good kids, it makes them more confident the next year.”The Oxford don, who is involved in admissions, said this data would make parents think twice about sending their child to a private school.“This is a success story - unless you are paying a fortune for your children’s education,” he said. “I think the message is pretty obvious - if you are a family that is set on Oxford or Cambridge, it is a no brainer. You send them to a state sixth form college, you stop paying the high fees and they have the right flag by their name when they apply.”Barnaby Lenon, chairman of the Independent Schools Council, said that fee-paying institutions remain satisfied that “most of their best applicants” are still getting into Oxbridge and that privately educated pupils are still overrepresented at both universities.He also pointed out that independent schools are increasingly looking to Ivy League institutions in America - such as Harvard - as destinations for their pupils.“They are doing this because these are very much the best universities in the world for certain courses and because they offer generous scholarships and bursaries to the best students in the UK,” he said.Mr Lenon, a former headmaster at Harrow School, also pointed out that some of the top state schools for getting pupils into Oxbridge were originally created by private schools.“It is important to understand that some of these schools were set up by independent schools in order to help improve the exam results of sixth formers in disadvantaged areas,” he said. “No one has more to promote these kinds of schools than Eton.”The London Academy of Excellence, which has more than quadrupled its offers over five years, was set up by a coalition of private schools - including Eton and Harrow - led by Brighton College.And Harris Westminster Sixth Form - which was set up by the fee-paying Westminster School - has also seen its Oxbridge offers increase fourfold from 10 to 44. Mr Lenon, who was the first chairman of governors at the London Academy of Excellence, said that the high number of Oxbridge offers that go to pupils from top state schools is “to be welcomed and is not a surprise”.He explained: “In the last 10 years, these very successful state schools have emerged. And the thing to bear in mind is that they are extremely selective at age 16, to be admitted you need stellar GCSE grades.” Eton College declined to comment. Oxford and Cambridge both said they have fair and robust admissions policies where they consider all applicants inidually and on merit, regardless of which school they attend or what their background is. More from NewsAJ Odudu could miss Strictly Come Dancing final as injury leaves her on crutchesScale back your Christmas plans, say Boris Johnson and Chris WhittyPCR testing labs ‘likely to be overwhelmed within days’ amid pre-Christmas rise in demandBoris is dooming Britain to a dismal cycle of never-ending lockdownsPharmacies accuse NHS of \u0026#39tactical error\u0026#39 for rejecting help with Covid booster vaccinationsBlow for Boris Johnson as all six leaders of 1922 Committee join rebellion against Covid passportsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"public mood turning sherelle jacobs responds readers omicron","story":"In my column this week, I argued that the UK is on a conveyor belt towards another lockdown, but that too little attention is paid to the uncertain costs of the restrictions. It may even be that the effects of lockdowns are getting worse every time they are tried. Here, I respond to a selection of comments from  readers:Bill John wrote: “I have no idea whether these measures are necessary or not. Like most of the people below the line, as well as Sherelle Jacobs above the line, I have none of the skills, qualifications or experience necessary to make that judgment. Which is why it is best handed over to that tiny minority of people who do.”Mr John suggests that armchair critics like me should leave the field to the experts. But given the high stakes inherent in whatever decisions are made, this minority of scientific experts and politicians should, at the very minimum, be able to demonstrate two things. First, that their decisions are informed by clinical evidence, as well as modelling. Second, that they include a detailed cost-benefit analysis that balances the potential Covid risks to the NHS against the possible fallout of restrictions.As I wrote in my column, there is very little evidence of either. One thing that particularly alarms me is the bizarre failure to seize the opportunity, over recent months, to gather useful data and evidence for proper cost-benefit analyses when the situation demands. There has been little research into the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on society. On the other end of the scale, the NHS has not published in full critical care capacity since the start of the pandemic, claiming it lacks the resources to do so. It is therefore very difficult to assess the threat of the health service becoming overwhelmed. Until I am convinced that those who are supposed to know what they are talking about actually do know what they are talking about, I am afraid that I will continue my endeavours to hold them to account.  The core argument in my piece this week was that we cannot go on with the same narrow and histrionic approach to the pandemic. The big question now is whether the wider public, which has largely supported the Government’s Covid measures, is starting to fall in with this view. Jane Marks-Chell argues that “the mood is changing in the UK”. This sentiment is echoed by Alex Thomson who says that “the public are exhausted of measures but (just about) still complying, albeit with a barely disguised cynicism, and for many, compliance is now performative”. readers are on the money here the polls are indeed starting to shift. Sixty eight per cent of English adults are opposed to closing pubs and restaurants, and 61 per cent are against any ban on household mixing, according to a YouGov survey published in the first week of December. We need to see more recent data, but at the end of November just before the omicron panic set in, support for working from home was declining, with 56 per cent in favour, compared with 85 per cent in April 2020.Keith Turkish speaks for many  readers when he says: “If this is what is required to protect the NHS, then it is not fit for purpose. Throwing more money at the behemoth is not the right answer.” So does Nick Elliott, who points to the “decades of poor management” and the lack of “courage for reform”. I completely agree on all these points. Again, though, the key political question now is whether the wider public share this view. Tory politicians remain convinced that Workington Man tends more to the perspective that the NHS is simply underfunded. Yet even before the pandemic, a survey in 2018 found that 58 per cent of British voters believe that the NHS needs reform more than it needs extra cash. Polls also consistently show that voters believe the NHS wastes money. If a consensus gathers around the idea that learning to live with Covid requires root-and-branch NHS reform, then the Conservatives will come to seriously regret their timidity on this front. At the very least, alongside efforts to clear the current backlog, we need a radical national plan for boosting ICU capacity, with “silent” ICU wards that can be activated during an emergency and expanding the pool of non-ICU staff that can assist during surges. If not, come election time, voters will be asking where all the extra money has gone. And this populist Tory Government may find itself more unpopular than it has ever been. More from NewsAJ Odudu could miss Strictly Come Dancing final as injury leaves her on crutchesScale back your Christmas plans, say Boris Johnson and Chris WhittyPCR testing labs ‘likely to be overwhelmed within days’ amid pre-Christmas rise in demandBoris is dooming Britain to a dismal cycle of never-ending lockdownsPharmacies accuse NHS of \u0026#39tactical error\u0026#39 for rejecting help with Covid booster vaccinationsBlow for Boris Johnson as all six leaders of 1922 Committee join rebellion against Covid passportsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed success every single school getting pupils oxford cambridge","story":"Choosing which school to send your children to is one of the most important decisions a parent will make.Some families will prioritise looking at which extra-curricular activities a school offers, while others will be more concerned about the amount of outdoor space.But for many parents, the most important consideration is the academic credentials of the school and whether it has a good track record of sending pupils to the country’s two top universities: Oxford and Cambridge.The  has obtained data from Oxford and Cambridge about how many offers they have made to every single school over the past five years.You can now see how many Oxbridge offers pupils at every school in the UK - as well as international schools - have received each year between 2017 and 2021.You can also examine the success rate of every school, which is calculated by working out how many of their pupils’ applications resulted in offers each year.Use our interactive graphic here to explore the results.

Right now it’s not safe for people who know about the origin of the pandemic to come forward. But we live in an era where there is so much information being stored that it will eventually come out. “We have heard from many top virologists that a genetically engineered origin is reasonable and that includes virologists who made modifications to the first Sars virus. “We know this virus has a unique feature, called the furin cleavage site, and without this feature there is no way this would be causing this pandemic.“A proposal was leaked showing that EcoHealth and the Wuhan Institute of Virology were developing a pipeline for inserting novel furin cleavage sites. So, you find these scientists who said in early 2018 ‘I’m going to put horns on horses’ and at the end of 2019 a unicorn turns up in Wuhan city.” The furin cleavage point on Covid-19 is part of the spike protein which helps it to enter cells.Spike proteins are little grappling hooks which lock onto receptors on human cells. They have two sections, a binding section and a cell-entry section.Once attached, the virus makes use of the enzyme furin - which is present in human cells - to snip away the bound section, leaving a space for the cell-entry section of the spike protein to fuse with the cell membrane and get inside. It is the reason Covid-19 is so infectious.Viscount Ridley, who co-authored a book on the origin of the virus with Dr Chan, said he also believed a lab leak was now the likely origin.Lord Ridley told MPs: “I also think it’s more likely than not because we have to face the fact after two months we knew the origins of Sars, and after a couple of months we knew Mers was though through camels, but after two years we still haven\u0027t found a single infected animal that could be the progenitor, and that’s incredibly surprising.“We need to find out so we can prevent the next pandemic. We need to know whether we should be tightening up work in laboratories or whether we should be tightening up regulations related to wildlife markets. At the moment we are really not doing either. “We also need to know to deter bad actors who are watching this episode and thinking that unleashing a pandemic is something they could get away with. “We know now that experiments were being done at biosecurity level 2 (similar to a dentist\u0027s office) that resulted in 10,000 times increases in infectivity of viruses and three or four times their lethality. The important thing is to stop doing these experiments that are risky.”During the session, the editor of the Lancet, Richard Horton, was also criticised over a letter published by the journal in 2020 which dismissed the lab leak theory as a ‘conspiracy theory’ and effectively shut down the debate into the lab leak theory.The letter was authored by Peter Daszak, the head of EcoHealth alliance, who had worked closely with the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) engineering bat coronaviruses. Yet despite the close link, it took 16 months for the Lancet to publish a memo setting out Mr Daszak’s conflicts of interest. Aaron Bell said the memorandum declaring Mr Daszak’s interests had been ‘too little too late.’Mr Horton argued it had taken more than a year to ‘persuade’ Mr Daszak to declare that EcoHealth was working with the Wuhan Institute of Virology. “We ask everybody to declare their competing interest and we take those statements on trust and in this care regrettably the authors claimed they had no competing interest and of course the implication there were indeed competing interests that were significant, particularly in relation to Peter Daszak,” said Mr Horton.“We take declarations of conflicts of interests on trust. We quickly became aware of Peter Daszak’s conflict of interest and we ended up having a debate with him because his view was ‘Look, I’m an expert working in China on bat coronaviruses and that isn’t a competing interest, it makes me an expert.’“But in the court of public opinion, that is a competing interest you should declare and it took us over a year to persuade him to declare his full competing interest.”Mr Horton also said that the lab leak was now: ‘a hypothesis that should be taken seriously and needs to be further investigated.’More from NewsAJ Odudu could miss Strictly Come Dancing final as injury leaves her on crutchesScale back your Christmas plans, say Boris Johnson and Chris WhittyPCR testing labs ‘likely to be overwhelmed within days’ amid pre-Christmas rise in demandBoris is dooming Britain to a dismal cycle of never-ending lockdownsPharmacies accuse NHS of \u0026#39tactical error\u0026#39 for rejecting help with Covid booster vaccinationsBlow for Boris Johnson as all six leaders of 1922 Committee join rebellion against Covid passportsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid restrictions need last 8","story":"Covid restrictions need to last  WEEKS as Christmas pub closures drawn upDr Susan Hopkins, of the UK Health Security Agency , told MPs there would need to be some level of restrictions in place for the next four to eight weeksmodelling is correctthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video boris-johnson-wont-rule-out-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:vLSaYCey,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics , options :,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Evenbooster jabs are found to be effective against Omicron, they projected a wave of infection which could lead to a peak of more than , daily hospital admissions.MPs are due to vote on Plan B restrictions in the Commons later, with Boris Johnson facing a major Tory revolt over plans for Covid passports for nightclubs and large events. It comes after Mr Johnson warned his Cabinet “a huge spike of Omicron was coming” and said a model claiming , people got infected with the iant yesterday was “valid”. Chief Medical Officer Professor Chris Whitty also reportedly told the Cabinet that pubs, shops and restaurants could be forced to shut in January due to staff shortages caused by Omicron. Dr Hopkins was grilled about the need for restrictions by the Commons Science and Technology Committee. Asked by Tory Committee chair Greg Clark on the exit strategy from Covid curbs, she said: This is our fourth time going into something like this.The waves last a period of time and the more the restrictions are effective, then the smaller the peak, and therefore you can reduce andle to normal. She said boosting the population was likely to reduce hospitalisations - and limit the strain on the NHS.Asked when restrictions could be lted based on the modelling so far, she said: So I think thatthe modelling that the London School has done [is right], I would expect that there is going to be needing some level of restrictions in place for the next four to eight weeks.” It came as Downing Street today refused again to rule out bringing in new restrictions before Christmas. Whitehall officials have reportedly been drawing up tighter curbs for England - that could include limiting pubs and restaurants to outdoor dining. They could even be forced to shut their doors entirelyit means people can see their families at Christmas. The PM’s spokesman insisted Plan B measures - which stop short of restrictions on pubs - “were balanced and proportionate”. But he refused to rule out further restrictions, calling them speculation and hypothetical”, and saying only that there weren’t “plans” to bring them in.  Asked about reports furlough could be brought backpubs have to shut, he replied: “I’m not going to get into hypotheticals - no plans.” And he refused to rule out bringing in restrictions while MPs are on their Christmas break. The spokesman said: “What we are saying is we want to introduce the measures as set out in Plan B, which will help reduce transmission whilst we get more boosters in arms, which is the biggest single action we can take. “As I’ve said on a number of occasions, we need to learn more about this iant on things like severity before we decide what,any, action is required in the future.” He added: “Obviously we will always want to ensure Parliament will have its say, should there be any requirements to make changes. “In extremis, as the public would expect, we have the ability in the interests of public health to make changes.” Askedchanges could be made while MPs are on recess he replied: “It would depend on the circumstances.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Coronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It shows  people crowded together - in blatant breach of lockdown rules - in a medium-sized room in the party’s Westminster HQ.Some of the group are shown wearing paper hats while one is sporting a House of Commons Christmas jumper.The event, organised by top Tory Shaun Bailey ’s mayoral campaign, took place on December  last year when London was in Tier .After he was approached by the Mirror tonight, Mr Bailey dramatically quit as chair of the London Assembly’s police and crime committee.  The image also shows several guests - including billionaire Tory donor Nick Candy - raising glasses of wine while a catered buffet features prominently. One of the revellers was a senior figure on Boris Johnsonaposs leadership election campaign. It emerged last week that Tory staff danced and drank wine late into the night and revellers damaged a door at what was described as a “raucous” event. At the time, the capital was in Tier  restrictions which banned any social mixing between households indoors.The party took place the day before the No  festive quiz, where Boris Johnson was pictured as quizmaster, and four days ahead of the Downing Street Christmas bash.Hours before the party then health secretary Matt Hancock announced that the capital would move into tougher Tier  restrictions. Tory insiders suggested tonight that party chairman Oliver Dowden was appalled by the photograph of the festive event. The Conservatives have said that “formal disciplinary action” had been taken against four CCHQ staff seconded to the campaign. A spokesman said: “Senior CCHQ staff became aware of an unauthorised social gathering in the basement of [CCHQ] organised by the Bailey campaign on the evening of th December. “Formal disciplinary action was taken against the four CCHQ staff who were seconded to the Bailey campaign.” Scotland Yard has until now refused to investigate the Christmas gatherings citing a lack of evidence.  Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: “This is damning new evidence of a party, with a buffet, drinks, Christmas attire and absolutely no social distancing held at Conservative Party HQ.“Shaun Bailey is an elected official that is clearly breaking Covid regulations in this photo and encouraging the same of his staff. “Whilst everyone  was making sacrices to keep their community safe, the chair of the Police and Crime committee in the Greater London Authority was partying. “His position as chair was untenable and he knew that.” Mr Bailey, who does not drink alcohol, is said to have left the party early in the evening, shortly after the picture was taken. A Shaun Bailey campaign spokesperson said: “On the evening of  December , at the end of the working day, the campaign hosted a post-work event to thank campaign staff for their efforts over the course of they year. “This was a serious error of judgement and we fully accept that gathering like this as that time was wrong and apologise unreservedly”. A spokesperson for Mr Candy said: “Nick Candy attended the office of the Shaun Bailey campaign for an end of year review on  December .He gave a short thank you speech to the team and spent some time with Shaun Bailey to discuss campaign matters before leaving shortly afterwards.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyGreater London AuthorityShaun BaileyBoris JohnsonCrimePoliticsCoronavirusDowning Street Christmas PartyTory Government\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The revolt raised serious questions about his authority, which has been battered by multiple claims of rule-breaking parties in Westminster in the run up to Christmas last year. In a fiery Prime Ministeraposs Questions clash, Mr Starmer said: The virus is spreading once again and lives and livelihoods are at risk. The British public are looking for a prime minister with the trust and the authority to lead Britain through the crisis.  Instead we are burdened with the worst possible Prime Minister at the worst possible time. He mocked jeering Tory MPs, many of whom rebelled against the Government yesterday, saying: Where were they in the lobby last night  Mr Starmer went on: His own MPs have had enough, they wonapost defend him and they wonapost turn up to support him andhe proposes them, they wonapost vote for basic public health measures. He said the PM was so weak that Plan B measures would not have got through without Labour backing.

We canapost go on with a Prime Minister who is too weak to lead. So will the Prime Minister take time this Christmas to look in the mirror and ask himself whether he has the trust and authority to lead this country  Mr Johnson replied: We won that vote last night with Conservative votes. I respect the anxieties have colleagues have - of course I do - about restrictions on their liberty. But I believe the approach we are taking is balanced, proportionate and right for this country. Mr Johnson defended the tough decisions he has taken and tried to accuse Labour of playing politics during a crisis. He concluded: They vacillate, we vaccinate. They jabber, we jab. They play party politics and we get on with the job. In bad-tempered scenes, SDLP MP Colum Eastwood called on the PM to resign to restore public confidence. He said: The Prime Ministeraposs actions over the last number of months has absolutely eroded public confidence at the worst possible time and a public health crisis. excusing rule breaking by its own MPs ignoring real breaking and his own posts. He canapost even lead Tory MPs to vote for his public health guidance. How does he expect to lead anybody   Surely no, it is time Mr. Speaker for him to do the right thing. The only thing left him to restore public confidence and resign. The PM replied: No, Iaposm going to get on with making sure that we get through this pandemic together as one UK and making sure that we protect trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland in the way that I know he would want it protected.

Education Minister Alex Burghart said extra funding has been put in place so schools can test their pupils before heading back into the classroom. But Tory MP Robert Halfon, chair of the Commons Education Select Committee, said he fears we are moving towards de facto school closures, despite the Ministers assurances. Downing Street warned parents not to take their children out of school before term ends, responding to suggestions some parents kept their kids at home to protect them from Omicron. The Prime Ministeraposs spokesman said: “The best place for children – who have in many respects suffered the most through this pandemic – is in school, receiving vital face-to-face education.”  He added: “It’s important schools – and indeed parents – don’t take precautionary steps to deprive their children of education”. Responding to a barrage of claims that schools may close, Mr Burghart told the Commons Government remains committed to ensuring schools reopen in January as normal, amid fears the spread of Omicron will keep kids at home. And he insisted the classroom is the very best place for children and their development. Mr Halfon said: “It seems to me we are moving sadly towards de facto school closures”, as he urged the Government to create an “army” of volunteers and public awareness campaign for the education sector. “The four horsemen of the education apocalypse have been galloping towards our young people in the form of a widening attainment gap, an epidemic of mental health problems, a rise in safeguarding hazards and a loss of le chances, he added.  Mr Burghart outlined the measures that will be enacted in schools to keep Covid at bay. They include on site lateral flow testing onfor secondary school students, continued regular testing at home and a comprehensive contingency framework to manage potential outbreaks. Tory MP Lia Nici echoed Mr Halfonaposs calls for better messaging, so parents and students feel safe ing to the classrom. She told the Commons: We need to make sure that parents understand that itaposs more important for the children to be at home and then not to be afraid. Could he just make sure that that we get the message out now to parents to say school is safe and school is the best thing for your children  Former health minister Steve Brine highlighted union calls for a staggeredin January, adding: “What is the Government going to do legally to see that its will is enforced and that schools are back, as they should be, as they need to be in January ” Shadow schools minister Stephen Morgan accused the Government of “complacency” on pupils’ health and education, claiming ministers were “falling short” on the issues of vaccination and ventilation in schools. He said: “Time and time again this Government’s failure to plan ahead has left children bearing the brunt of the pandemic. Ministers must stop treating them as an afterthought and act now to avoid chaos next term.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Shaun BaileyNadhim ZahawiConservative PartyNew YearEducationSchoolsMental healthSecondary schoolChildcarePoliticsChristmas party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It comes on the day of the Covid Pass roll out, which will make it mandatory for members of the public to present a vaccine passport to enter some venues. And for the third day people were forced to stand in snaking queues outside vaccination centres while waiting for their third booster dose. Speaking of the shortages, UK Health Security Agency chief Dr Jenny Harries said the spike in test seeking has caused temporary pressure. Dr Jenny Harries said the NHS is experiencing unprecedented demand for PCR tests.She went on: We had already planned to increase capacity over the winter, because we predicted a dficult winter. We clearly couldnapost predict a iant like Omicron. We have some flexibility there. We currently have about , tests per day available. If you go back to when we had no tests, or very few, about , I think going back to autumn last year, this is a huge achievement. She added: Yesterday the public may have seen some pressure on some of those sites. Iaposm in Wales. Some of the test sites here will be at seven per cent or eight per cent capacity. In London, they were quite full. People can still order tests at home, and we have put in mobile testing units to try and boost those supplies so people can get tested. So we do have sufficient tests both for PCR and LFTs . But the very rapid rises is causing some temporary pressure.  On Monday, Brits rushed out in their thousands to get a booster jab in a bid to save Christmas as Omicron sparked fears of another locked down festive period.Since then, members of the public were spotted queuing for hours outside vaccine centres. But as people rushed to do the right thing in the battle against the mutation drive, the NHS booking website crashed.Those arriving at vaccination centres faced five-hour long queues and online lateral flow tests ran out. Last week Boris Johnson announced his Plan B to deal with the sharp increase in Omicron cases.Speaking at a Downing Street press conference, the Prime Minister said the doubling time of the new strain could be between two and three days - meaning its spread will be rapid. Under the stricter rules people must show a Covid vaccine passport to enter some venues in England. Butsomeone is unjabbed they can still enter as long as they produce a negative lateral flow test. Covid passports will be made mandatory for nightclubs and large events, and rules on face masks would be “further extended” from Friday, to “most public indoor venues” including theatres and cinemas. Covid testing could also see up to one million Brits spending Christmas Day in isolation this year.Official models suggest that four times as many people could be self-isolating on December  compared to last year.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSChristmasCoronavirusCoronavirus testing\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Now Lord Heseltine, he said: “The arboretum is -acres, we had  nesting boxes and the squirrels trashed them. “They just ate their way in. That is the end of the fledglings, and the eggs. I am dead keen on protecting songbirds. So we decided to become a squirrel free zone.” Speaking on BBC R’s Jeremy Vine Show, he added: “On  acres, we shot , we got professionals to do that. Now  squirrels come in every year to replace those we shoot.“There are no predators for them, soyou want to protect the bird population, you really need to get rid of the grey squirrel. “They were looking for food, I don’t blame them, but I am on the side of the songbird.” Natalia Doran, of the Urban Squirrel Sanctuary, said research suggested that the presence of grey squirrels did not have an impact on bird populations. “A scientic study proves it is not signicant,” she added. “This is about how we relate to Nature, when we interact, it is a two-way process. There are natural ways of keeping the numbers down.” And listener Dave Hall, from the Wirral, condemned Lord Heseltine.  He said: “Shame on anybody who persecutes them. I fear that someone like Michael Heseltine bragging about people shooting these poor animals gives licence to the enemies of these perceived pests.“What’s wrong with squirrels coming into a garden ” He said he was ‘not just appalled, but horried’ at the thought of killing them. There are an estimated .m greys in the UK. The population continues to grow. They have limited protection. As the law stands it is legal to kill them in a humane manner. It is an offence under section  of the Wildle and Countryside Actto introduce and release grey squirrels into the wild.

Around , men served at  bomb tests and more than  radiation experiments in Australia, America and the South Pacic between  and . Many have died from cancers and suffered rare blood disorders. Their , descendants show  times the usual rate of birth defects, which the government refuses to investigate.After meeting survivors, Mr Burnham said: “It feels like you were victims of a crime, and that has been passed down through your families.” Mr Rotheram added: “The pattern of these scandals is the always the same. They deflect the truth, they make it about money, they deny, suppress, cover up, and blame.” John Morris told them: “I don’t want their money, I just want the damned truth.” In , aged , he was among troops exposed on a beach when the . megaton Grapple X bomb was exploded  miles away. “I wore a shirt, shorts, and sunglasses. The flash was white, the heat like a blowtorch on your back, then we were knocked off our feet,” said John, , from Rochdale. “There were , men running around, terried. We couldn’t get in our wagons to get away because the tires had melted. If I told you to stand  miles away from the Sun, would you do it ” Read more After hishome, John was diagnosed with a radiation-related blood disorder. His first-born Steven died in , aged four months, in an unexplained cot death. Daughter Liz Bacon said: “We’re made to feel unreasonable just for questioning it. He didn’t even get the autopsy report until .” Ex-railway manager Archie Hart, , of Warrington, told how he was an -year-old stoker on HMS Diana in  when the ship was twice ordered to spend  hours in the fallout of atomic bombs in a human experiment designed to test the effect on ship and crew. Archie, wearing just a cotton hood for protection, was on deck throughout, and within two years began developing benign tumours. “There’s  all over my body, some the size of tennis balls,” he told the mayors. “I can’t do the dance of the seven veils anymore, because my body’s an unsightly mess. What they did to us was morally wrong, and their cavalier attitude in the years since is causing problems to this day for the generations that follow.” Both men have survived cancer, but told the mayors: “We were the lucky ones.” Alan Owen, whose Royal Navy dad Jesse died aged  after witnessing  US bomb tests in  days in , said: “The Americans compensated my family, but our own governments delay, deny, until we die.” For more than  years the Mirror has campaigned for justice for the brave men who took part in Britain’s nuclear weapons tests. The Ministry of Defence has fought back every step of the way. We have told countless heartbreaking stories of grieving mums, children with deformities, men aged before their time and widows struggling to hold their families together, all while campaigning for recognition. Two years ago we launched an appeal for a medal for the , survivors. For the first time we were able to prove some were unwittingly used in experiments. Our appeal was backed by then-Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson but his review foundered after he lost his job. It had only six meetings in two years. They never asked to meet veterans. They never questioned the evidence. Instead they asked for information from the MoD, which has a track record of denying what its own paperwork later proves. And as our medal campaign gathered steam, civil servants simultaneously withdrew public documents from the National Archives. Would anyone working in Whitehall today stay there, megatons of plutonium exploded south of the river  The test veterans and their families will never stop fighting. The Mirror will never cease to demand they are heard. Prime Minister, listen to them. Overturn this disgraceful decision. Mr Burnham said: “These are the tactics of the British state: to deflect onto the victims, use a lack of progress to grind people down, and create mental torture so people cannot fight injustice.” Both mayors supported the idea of a medal for its “totemic signicance” to veterans, whose average age is now , and promised to support an nuclear tests education programme to be rolled out across their regions’ schools, with veterans meeting children to discuss their personal legacy.And they demanded Prime Minister Boris Johnson look veterans in the eye at a personal meeting. “We’re used to broken promises, but this transcends the party political Punch and Judy,” said Mr Rotheram.Mr Burnham added: “He needs to show them the respect they deserve.” Archie Hart, stoker, HMS Diana Archie Hart was an -year-old sailor on National Service when he was used in Operation Mosaic, a human radiation experiment. Destroyer HMS Diana spent a total of  hours chasing the mushroom clouds detonated off the coast of Australia in . One bomb had a yield the same as that which flattened Hiroshima in  the other was seven times as powerful.  Captain John Gower later wrote that the aim was “to deliberately contaminate our ship and to continue to serve in a ship, parts of which had been unacceptably radioactive”. He said that after the tests the onboard evaporators, which made the crew’s drinking water, were “hot”. Most of Diana’s crew of  men have since died, many from cancer. Fewer than a dozen are believed to still be alive. John Morris, private, Royal Ordnance Corps John Morris witnessed four nuclear explosions in  at Christmas Island in the South Pacic. A private in the Royal Ordnance Corps, he was among , troops ordered to prepare it for H-bomb tests. Aged , he was ordered to stand on a beach and watch the explosion of Operation Grapple X, a . megaton blast, just  miles away.  He was diagnosed with pernicious anaemia at , a condition caused by the bone marrow’s failure to produce red blood cells, and linked to gamma radiation exposure. In  he and we Betty lost their first son Steven at just four months old, and the couple were wrongly arrested for his murder. A post mortem concluded he had died from bronchopneumonia - a condition he showed no symptoms of. His heart and lungs were covered in microscopic haemorrhages.

Ghana, where my son has gone, introduced new restrictions on Friday night, which meant that anyone over the age of  flying into the country had to be double jabbed – which meant even more document scrutiny in the departure lounge.

The American buyer was struck by the unframed drawingaposs beauty but both he and the seller believed it was a th century reproduction.  Clford Schorer, an art dealer for Agnews and a Durer expert, was informed about it from an antiquarian book dealer three years ago after the new owner had tried without success to sell it. He agreed to take a look at it himself and visited the vendor who presented the drawing to him on his dining room table. Mr Schorer stared at it for an hour as he was blown away by its aposmagnicenceapos, instantly thinking it could be the aposreal thingapos.

This will allow you to see whether you have any symptoms, and it also gives you plenty of time to get a PCR test result should you come into contact with someone whoaposs tested positive for Covid or the Omicron iant. And, there is also a risk of unintentionally infecting people you come into close contact with as you may not be aware of your symptoms instantly. Dr Foster says: You are not likely to be infectious for the first  hours of exposure as you wonapost have built up enough virus to be able to spread it to someone .Read More If you want to reduce your chances of spreading the virus, you should be regularly testing with lateral flow tests, particularlyyou feel any Omicron symptoms. The unusual Omicron symptoms to look out for ahead of visiting family this ChristmasWhile Covid symptoms for the iants have fairly similar characteristics, South African Medical Association chair Dr Angelique Coetzee, revealed that a key dferentiating symptom with Omicron is headaches on Tuesday, December .She said: Evenyou wake up with a slight headache, not feeling well, please come and let us [GPs] double check. Another potential Omicron symptom mentioned by Dr Coetzee was myalgia, so you may feel muscle soreness or body ache. If you begin to feel unwell and have any cold or flu-like symptoms, or even a headache, be sure to take a rapid lateral flow test as soon as possible and avoid socialising. Due to the incubation period, youaposre unlikely to test positive on a PCR test instantly, so Dr Coetzee recommends waiting  hours before testing.  Dr Jeff Fosteraposs tips for staying safe at Christmas and avoiding the spread of coronavirus If youaposre planning on heading home to visit family and loved ones this Christmas, Dr Jeff Foster recommends following these measures to keep yourself and others safe. . Get vaccinated Dr Foster says: This is the best thing you can do. One year on, we can see the massive benefits the vaccine has had in reducing hospitalisation and death. We also know that while there is some reduction in its effectiveness over time, the booster still has signicant protective effects even on the Omicron iant. The government aims to have offered all of the UKaposs adult population vaccinated with the booster jab by the end of .All adults in the country are now able to go to walk-in centres for their booster jab, or will soon be contacted to book an appointment.. Wear a mask As self-explanatory as it sounds, wearing a mask is one of the best ways to signicantly reduce your chances of getting Covid. Dr Foster explains: There are people that believe is an imposition on their liberties and rights, but overall the evidence is that it reduces the spread of the disease.  It is not a terrible imposition to ask, it harms no one and it may help save an elderly or vulnerable personaposs le. . Ventilation is key While comfort and cosiness is key at Christmas, itaposs worth keeping windows open throughout the house whenever possible when youaposre with your family during the festive season. Revealing how much of a dference it makes, Dr Foster says: Covid likes stale and still air where it can be breathed in again and again. You will not get covid from breathing a single virus, but it is about breathing enough of it in to trigger an immune response and allow the virus to spread. Keep your windows open and circulate the air. This disperses the virus and reduces the chance of breathing it in.. Hand sanitiser Another factor thataposs absolutely crucial when out and about or on public transport is using hand sanitiser and washing your hands frequently. Keep a mini bottle in your pocket or bag and sanitise your hands throughout the day to avoid spreading the virus. Dr Foster adds: In addition to breathing it in, touching something a virus has had contact with and then touching our faces is a common way we get a lot of viruses including covid. Wash your hands and give people a ready supply of hand gel.

Willy Wardlaw, who lives with his we and two children in Stirling, Scotland, says the issue has been ongoing for “four to five years”. It repeats every time there is heavy rain in the area, he said, leaving his young family having to wade through waste on their way out of their home. He has been left angered by the efforts of Scottish Water to address the drainage problem, claiming he has been “fobbed off” with quick clean ups, rather than action to reverse the blocking issues.Willy told theDaily Recordthe issue had been going on for “years”.  “It’s about the fourth or fth time this year that it has been covered with sewage,” he said. “The main drain comes down the side of our street and backs up waste and toilet paper into our garden, meaning that my kids have to wade through it, as well as my elderly neighbour downstairs who can’t get out of her door. “We’ve been in touch with Scottish Water a few times about it, but they just send someone out to clean it up. “The guys who are sent out to clean it up do a great job, but they need to fix the source of the problem because the next time it rains, it’ll just happen again.  “We’ve written to them and contacted their Facebook page about it, but we don’t hear from anyone up the tree, just the guys who are sent out to clean it up.In response, a Scottish Water spokesperson said: “We are aware of an issue with sewer flooding at this property and have attended on a number of occasions to deal with blockages, clean the sewer and carry out clean-ups of the affected area. “Last week, Scottish Water operatives were in attendance and carried out investigations. We would like to reassure the customer that further survey work is now being planned to establish the cause and a possible solution to help avoid future blockages.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Daily RecordFloodsSewage\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Discover Health conducted the research into the , cases and now have listed the symptom as myalgia - muscle aches and pains.Experts in the UK have already identied that Omicron tends to have very dferent symptoms from other iants of the disease.Normally people are asked to look out for a fever, persistent cough and loss of sense of taste or smell as signs of Covid.  But now Omicron is reported to give symptoms more like a common cold - a scratchy throat, runny nose, sneezing and headache. The symptoms are considered similar to a common cold - but experts have warned that in London,you think you have a cold, itaposs actually more likely to Omicron. The first UK cases of Omicron were only confirmed on November  and the speed of its spread has alarmed ministers and prompted a dramatic acceleration of the booster jab programme. Boris Johnson has set an ambitious target of one million jabs a day and to ensure the roll out is continuous, people will even be able to get their booster shot on Christmas Day. The UK Health Security Agency has previously projected that Omicron could become the dominant iant across the country by the middle of the month. So far one person is confirmed to have died from the Omicron iant - but their age or vaccination status isnapost known. NHS England have scrapped the -minute wait for patients after theyaposve have their Pfizer Covid jabbed to speed up the booster programme.  They have done away with the quarter-of-an-hour sit-down so more doses can be administered. The isolation rules have also changed, with those who have come into contact with a positive case expected to do a daily lateral flow test. But there are currently no PCR Covid test slots left in some areas of England. A top medic has warned that Covid restrictions could be needed for up to eight weeksmodelling on the impact of the Omicron iant is correct.Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to the UK Health Security Agency , said there would need to be some level of restrictions in place for the next four to eight weeksestimates by the London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicinewere accurate.Scientists at LSHTM said the new strain could cause between , to , deaths in England over the next five months after examining experimental data. Evenbooster jabs are found to be effective against Omicron, they projected a wave of infection which could lead to a peak of more than , daily hospital admissions.  Dr Hopkins was grilled about the need for restrictions by the Commons Science and Technology Committee. Asked by Tory Committee chair Greg Clark on the exit strategy from Covid curbs, she said: This is our fourth time going into something like this. The waves last a period of time and the more the restrictions are effective, then the smaller the peak, and therefore you can reduce andle to normal.She said boosting the population was likely to reduce hospitalisations - and limit the strain on the NHS.Asked when restrictions could be lted based on the modelling so far, she said: So I think thatthe modelling that the London School has done [is right], I would expect that there is going to be needing some level of restrictions in place for the next four to eight weeks.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Back painOmicron iant\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But for royal children like Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, they donapost have to wait until the big day for some of their gts.And itaposs all down to a royal family tradition.They normally exchange and open their presents on Christmas Eve, a legacy of the German heritage of the monarchy.Former royal chef Darren McGrady said: The royals are of German descent so they weave in German traditions to their celebrations. After afternoon tea, they open gts on Christmas Eve, as is the German tradition.  So the Cambridge children will have already opened some of their presents before most other British kids.However, in , the Duchess of Cambridge did reveal George and Charlotte had been up early opening presents on Christmas Day itself.So maybe they open their presents that come from Santa on Christmas Day like other kids However, there is one type of present that Kate apparently likes to buy for her kids - and thataposs practical gts.

Royal author and expert Katie Nicholl told OK! : George enjoys his iPad at school, both he and Charlotte are quite tech-savvy and, like most children, there probably are technical gadgets and such like on their wish list.Iaposm sure theyaposre not going to want for anything, but when it comes to technology and screens, they are careful not to spoil them with extravagant gting.

Fuller sexually abused the nine-year-old girl in the hospital where he worked after she had died suddenly following complications from a common cold. The mum, who was not named, faced her daughteraposs attacker at Maidstone Crown Court on Wednesday where he is being sentenced for two murders and a string of sex attacks on corpses. Reading a victim impact statement, she said: I canapost say much of what I want to say to you today. What I can say is you raped my beautul daughter. She was the kindest person I have ever met. I donapost know how Iaposm going to carry on with my le now.  The mum said Fuller moved her daughteraposs toys and blankets to attack her, adding: I canapost even touch them now because of what he did. It breaks my heart.. I canapost eat, I canapost sleep, I feel sick. Her long blonde hair I brushed. But now I see that awful man touching her in that way. The court heard a string of statements from the families of Fulleraposs victims, who were aged between nine and . He attacked  women and girls of which  have been identied, the court heard today. One statement, read by prosecutor Duncan Atkinson QC, was from the father of a woman who had died aged  from an eating disorder. The dad said: My we died  years ago when she was  and the last thing she said to me was to look after the children. From beyond the grave this monster has defiled my daughter who I had promised my dying we that I would look after. A statement from the sister of another victim who took her own le said: We all deserve respect and peace in death and knowing she was brutally violated at her most vulnerable is deeply distressing. Another victimaposs sister said: When she died we thought there was no more suffering or indignity. We thought she was at peace. How wrong we were. It is incomprehensible that there is someone in the world who would do something so horric. One son said: The news shocked me to the core. I now know that the thought of what this man did to my mother will never go away. When I think of my mother my mind immediately thinks of what he did to her.  Balding and bespectacled Fuller sat hunched in the dock wearing a grey prison tracksuit and a black face mask. The court heard how he filmed and photographed his morgue sex attacks and catalogued them in files hidden in his home titled Necro Lord, Deadliest and Best Yet. He also created a spreadsheet with the names and ages of his victims. Fuller had manipulated images of his victims to lighten or erase visible scars, the court heard.  He beat and strangled Wendy Knell, , and Caroline Pierce, , to death before sexually assaulting them in two separate attacks in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, in . Fuller was caught  years later after a DNA breakthrough and a search of his home revealed he had recorded himself abusing bodies in the mortuaries of hospitals over more than a decade. He pleaded guilty to murdering Wendy and Caroline days into his trial after previously admitting manslaughter by diminished responsibility. Fuller also pleaded guilty to  other offences, including  charges relating to  identied victims, including three children, in mortuaries between  and November .

The dolphin was spotted doing the manoeuvre, suspended vertically with its nose down, fully underwater and rotating slowly. Drone footage was being used to survey the marine mammals off the Isle of Lewis in Scotland when the strange act was picked up. Conservationists say that while there have been sightings of the species headstanding in other parts of the world, those dolphin had their tails out of the water - and they have never seen a fully submerged headstand before. Whale and Dolphin Conservationresearcher Nicola Hodgins said one theory for the behaviour is that it could have been listening for the calls of other creatures in the water. Ms Hodgins said it shows how little is known about the social and cultural lives of the mammals.  WDC has been monitoring the population of Rissoaposs dolphins, photographing their dorsal fins which are as unique as fingerprints, off the coast of Lewis for more than a decade. The team from the charity use non-invasive techniques to study the dolphins, recording iniduals from boats at a distance. This year, they used a drone as part of their surveying - with footage capturing the never-before-seen underwater headstanding of the dolphin, which is thought to be at least  years old and was on its own at the time. Ms Hodgins said: Weaposve never seen this behaviour before and we donapost really know what itaposs doing. Weaposve got some guesses as to what it could be. It could be the fact that itaposs listening, just slowly listening out, and maybe thataposs one of the best ways -your headaposs at the surface of the water youaposre not going to hear as much as you wouldyouaposre a couple of metres down.  Or it could just be chilling and having a couple of secondsapos peace and quiet, she suggested. I did a bit of research, and tried to find outthis behaviour had been seen anywhere . There is a term known as aposheadstandingapos which has been seen in some Rissoaposs dolphins, in the Mediterranean for example, but in all of those occasions the animal is half-in, half-out of the water. Itaposs fascinating to think thereaposs behaviours and theyaposve got an entire social le we know so little about. The researchers are starting to piece together some information about their social le, she said, because - having photographed them since  - she can recognise iniduals and which others they spend time with.But Ms Hodgins said there are no population estimates for the animals around the UK, or around Scotland.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Western Digital CorporationDolphins\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Heres the key evidence that led to his le sentenceThere was a mountain of evidence against David Fuller, who pleaded guilty Image: PAByBenjamin LynchSEO writer:,  Dec | comments Family photographs, DNA evidence and millions more depraved images led to murderer David Fuller receiving a le sentence. Fuller pleaded guilty to his crimes and was sentenced after admitting to the murders of Wendy Knell, , and Caroline Pierce, , both from Tunbridge Wells in Kent. He will never be released from jail.He admitted to murdering the women days into his trial, and had previously admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility. The victims were found beaten and strangled, in , in horric incidents that became known as the aposBedsit Murdersapos. Ms Knellaposs body was found at her flat in the June of that year. However, Ms Pierce was found  miles away in Romney Marsh, her naked corpse found in a field after going missing in November, .His crimes stretched over three decades, and the court revealed a history of abuse of corpses in mortuaries in a tidal wave of grim evidence and the revelation of shocking events.The DNA evidence  The Bedsit Murders remained unsolved for over  years until DNA evidence led to Fuller. Cold-case detectives carried out a review of the national DNA database, which showed a close match to  people. This was eventually narrowed down to Fulleraposs brother, who partially matched samples taken from the crime scene in . Fuller, himself, was then revealed to be the killer, his DNA a billion-to-one match.  A prowler had been reported by victim Caroline Pierce one month before her disappearance. The prowler fitted the profile of Fuller. The prosecutor said: A male of a similar profile to Fuller had been seen looking through an address near to Wendy Knell on the same night. Fingerprints and family photos  The trial didnapost just rely on DNA evidence as, once Fuller was identied, he was swtly matched to other pieces found at the scene of the crimes. A bloodied Millets bag was found under victim Wendyaposs bed. It had a fingerprint on it that was a match to Fuller. Clarks footwear archivists also helped police to track down the bloody shoe marks found that belonged to a aposSportstrekapos trainer.  These shoes were then seen being worn in a family photo album by Fuller during the s and s. DS Ivan Beasley spoke about telling Wendy and Carolineaposs families of the arrest. He said: It was real, genuine shock. They had thought this day would never come. Clearly it has brought back a huge amount of emotion, trauma and grief. Depraved content on hard drives  An unexpected, but utterly horric, element of the case was the revelation of Fulleraposs other crimes. As well as the guilty murder plea, he also pleaded guilty to  other offences. This involves  charges relating to  identied victims, including three children, in mortuaries between  and November . They include the sexual penetration of a corpse, possessing an extreme pornographic image involving sexual interference with a corpse and the taking of indecent images of children.  Investigators have, so far, detected roughly  potential victims but conceded that all their identities may never come to light. Police raided his home in Heathfield, East Sussex, on December , , where they discovered hard drives with more than  million images of distressing sexual offences. These included images of him sexually assaulting dead bodies. Fuller had access to the bodies by working as a hospital electrician. He worked at the Kent and Sussex Hospital from , before moving on to Tunbridge Wells Hospital in . A jury at Maidstone Crown Court heard on Monday, December , , that Fuller had depraved sexual predilections and had attacked corpses for an extended period of time at the hospitals where he worked. You have proved that monsters exist  The ages of the bodies abused ranged wide, with one victim aged just nine-years-old. The childaposs mother said: It makes my skin crawl and it really does break my heart. I feel sick. I can’t sleep. It will haunt me forever. Ahead of sentencing, the daughter of a victim of the crimes was able to speak out.  She said: You have proved that monsters exist. You were cocky, arrogant and despicable. You are the worst of humanity. My mother was a survivor of domestic violence. It is almost too much to know that a man abused her again when she died, just because he could, for his own sexual gratication.

For over a decade and a half he has been a familiar face in the local community, having originally trained as a police dog but becoming a family pet when a working le was deemed unsuitable for him.Restaurant owners, shop and cafe workers came out for Barneyaposs goodbye, while his owner Anne did her best to hold back the tears, Belfast Live reports.  In the end, everyone wept for the big old dog who’d bounded into the le of the area and left to go home on stf legs, his belly full of treats, the end of his journey within sight. Anne said: “We’d held on as long as we could to Barney. We maybe should have let him go earlier but we just couldnapost and he didnapost want to go, we knew that. But one day he gave us the look and we knew it was time, he was tired, he was ready. His hips had become very stf and sore but worse than that he’d developed a tumour in his nose and mouth. So we knew the end was coming but it was hard to contemplate le without him, and it has been heartbreaking to say goodbye not only for us but for all the friends heaposd made along the way. “But as with everything, we did it for him, we did our best for Barney every day and saying goodbye was the kindest but hardest of them all. “All of his letime with us he’d had a daily routine of a walk through Ballyhackamore where he knew the staff in every cafe and shop. In that way he was really the community’s dog. He brought a smile to so many faces and his cafe friends told us his visit was the highlight of their day. For  years we did the rounds with him, his favourite stop off was at Cafe Nero where he always enjoyed a croissant and a cuddle.” Barney began police training aged nine months where he was trained to be an explosives detection dog. But while he showed talent for detecting explosives and bombs, Barney had no interest in staying with them until his handler arrived. So he was given up by the police as a lovely but unreliable police officer. Anne said: “Barney was our constant companion, everyone’s go-to ear for a chat, everyone’s hug, a comfort to us all. He was such a big softie, and after two changes of home, he made ours his last and he stayed with us for more than  years. “When it came to the day we knew we had to say goodbye, we knew we needed others to have that chance too. So we walked slowly to the coffee shops and everyone had a chat and a cuddle and a cry and everyone got to say their goodbyes to one of their best customers. He took his time and we let him. I honestly think he knew what was going on. It was emotional and dficult but also a great comfort to us and to his friends. “We went home again for a rest and then we went out to Seapark in Holywood where Barney had spent thousands of hours running and this time he just enjoyed the snfs and a lie down. Then we took him to McDonald’s where he enjoyed two cheeseburgers. But they knew they wanted Barney to slip away on his favourite spot on the sofa, and said their vet Steph did everything to ensure he could pass with them right by his side. She gave him a sedative and he just slipped away on his spot on where he slept all of his le, and then Steph gave him the last injection and he was gone. Weaposre so grateful to Steph to have allowed us the luxury of home care for Barney, it was so gentle, there was so much care taken over him. We know he wasnapost distressed but it broke our hearts and they’ve been broken ever since. It was the most awful honour to be able to help that last moment pass with dignity. Steph stepped out and let us have a lot of time with Barney afterwards and when we were ready, she wrapped him in a cosy blanket and carried him in her arms to her car. We have his ashes home now and we will always keep those. “Our home feels very empty with Barney, the leather settee he nibbled the covers off it still sitting with his blanket in place, his collar and lead are still hanging on the hook. “We’ve cried so many tears over this big dog, he was a gt to us and he held us together all of his le. He might have been a failed explosives dog but we knew his talents lay where, and so did he. His talent was to love and be loved and he excelled at it every moment of every day.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Cafe Nero PLCDogsTeamDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

People had been queuing since am, even though we didn’t even open until .am. The vaccine centres were given no early warning about Boris Johnson’s announcement and had not been able to prepare for the sheer numbers of people turning up that we’ve been seeing since Sunday. It was like opening the floodgates and letting all the water come rushing through. When a service like this relies on volunteers – people who have jobs and who aren’t always available – it’s been a logistical nightmare to get people to help.And when it comes to the queues, while most people are happy to accept there will be a wait, there are still people who think itaposs worth their while to shout at the staff helping. That doesn’t help anyone, so to calm things down I tell them that Iaposm a volunteer and just trying to do my best.  I’ve been helping out at my local vaccine centre, at a clinic in Crouch End, North London, since January. Iaposm normally there once a week with a clipboard at the door helping check people in, taking their temperature and directing them to where they need to go. It got me out of the house when everyone  was locked down, it’s been an incredibly rewarding experience and I’ve met people I would have never normally talked to in my daily le. While the NHS may be providing the vaccine service, it relies on volunteers to run it smoothly, from data inputting to greeting, to even giving people vaccines.  One of the biggest issues we’ve had over the last few days has been the sheer number of walk ins – particularly when they start impacting on waiting times for people who have booked. At my instigation, at our clinic we now have two queues so that people who have booked times aren’t waiting as long. While it can be stressful, a busy day at the vaccine clinic can be exciting. Everyone is working closely as a team, there’s an adrenaline rush, as well as a huge satisfaction in knowing that we are helping, that people will feel safer when they leave. But we also have to be extra careful not to make mistakes.  One of the hardest things is keeping on top of who is allowed a vaccine and when. There are strict rules about how long it should be since their last vaccine, there are also age limits and no amount of pleading from them can make us give them the jab - we aren’t making the rules. I’ve had people break down in tears because they can’t have their jab. They swear that they know more than us that we are telling them a lie. That’s one of the hardest things - I really didn’t sign up to stand around in the freezing cold for hours at a time to be shouted at. But usually people are calm and grateful – at the start of the vaccine programme they would even bring us chocolates and cakes. It’s immensely satisfying to be part of this huge push to keep everyone safe and I would recommend it to anyone who can help.

And one elderly woman from Leeds, Yorkshire, has discovered just how kind people can be after she was sent hundreds of Christmas cards from complete strangers who heard about her online. As Leeds Live reports, Margaret Pattison, , is receiving more and more cards each day thanks to an appeal started on Facebook by her granddaughter, Jenny Leamey.

Depraved Fuller, , beat and strangled Wendy Knell, , and Caroline Pierce, , to death before sexually assaulting them in two separate attacks in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, in . He also abused  dead bodies in the mortuaries of hospitals over more than a decade, his sentencing hearing at Maidstone Crown Court was told. The ages of the victims ranging from  to -years-old. The mother of a nine-year-old girl abused in the hospital mortuary by Fuller after she died said in court: It makes my skin crawl and it really does break my heart. I feel sick. I can’t sleep. It will haunt me forever.  Fuller filmed himself carrying out the attacks inside the now-closed Kent and Sussex Hospital and the Tunbridge Wells Hospital, in Pembury, where he worked in electrical maintenance roles since . Investigators have so far detected around  potential victims but admitted all their identities may never be known. He also pleaded guilty to  other offences, including  charges relating to  identied victims, including three children, in mortuaries between  and November . It was only when searching Fulleraposs house after arresting him for murder did detectives find proof of his warped crimes. They discovered hard drives with more than  million images of distressing sexual offences, which included images of him sexually assaulting dead bodies. The hospital electrician was convinced he would never serve justice for two murders and the sexual assault of over  corpses but in  things finally unravelled.After a check of the national database showed a close match to  people, cops whittled it down - eventually identying Fulleraposs brother, before finding the killer himself. Mrs Knellaposs mother Pamela Jones Knell read out an impact statement in court. Wendy was a caring thoughtful at times a bit scatty person who would do anything for anyone similar to me, she said. Always smiling, tall and skinny when young, when playing netball she came home with scraped. As she got older she always worked hard went to college did her exams.  She got a job and her employer asked her to look after children. She always wanted children. If she had children at least we would have had a part of her. I realised something went wrong, when I realised she never went to work that day. I never expected the reason would be she was dead. I rang my husband Bill who went to the flat and when he got there he told police his daughter lived inside and they told him there was a girl inside who was dad. You never expect to be told your daughter is dead. Katrina Frost, Caroline Pierceaposs mum, also spoke in court and said: My daughter Caroline was a typical teenager, just coming out of her rebellious stage. We agreed to meet for lunch after months. But now it became the most horric part of my le and a nightmare that continues to this day. I have had to endure  years of not know why anyone would do this. I never forgot racing across Kent having to identy the damaged body of my own flesh and blood. I can still recall the horror of seeing her body and what happened to her. She didn’t deserve what happened to her or being taken away from her family. She doesn’t deserve what this animal did to her. She must have been terried when she died.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Caroline PierceHospitalsDavid Fuller\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Laura Ward, , spent seven weeks in a coma before waking up to discover she had already given birth to her healthy baby girl, Hope. But the mum of two from Tyldesley, Wigan, still had to learn to walk, talk, feed and clean herself all over again as a result of the toll the virus took on her body, Manchester Evening News reports.After finally being discharged from hospital nearly five months since she was admitted, Laura, was greeted by her husband, John Leece, their children, parents and friends as she ed home in time for Christmas.  The adorable clip shows brave Laura stepping out of a car with a walker as her family, surrounded by balloons and hand-made posters with well-wishing messages, cheer her on and clap. Laura said: Iaposm so pleased to be home. The physiotherapist brought me home and John was there waiting for me with the kids. William was so excited he was shouting aposmummy, mummyapos and trying to get in the car. The teaching assistant first started feeling unwell as she finished school for the summer holidays this year with a bit of a cough. But when Lateral Flow Tests came back negative and her symptoms only worsened, Laura took a PCR test which ed a positive result. As she struggled to breathe, Laura was admitted at the Royal Bolton Hospital and was warned by maternity staff that they may have to deliver her baby early as she continued to decline over the next two weeks. Now the last thing she remembers is waking up on September  to learn that she had given birth to Hope via emergency C-section at  weeks while in an induced coma. She said: I opened my eyes to see Hope on the bed with me, but I couldnapost move any part of my body. All I could do was shake and nod my head. At its worst, the terrying ordeal saw doctors warn Lauraaposs family that she could dieshe didnapost get on an ECMO Machine, adding that it was the last resort for her. Not wanting to name their baby girl without her mumaposs involvement, partner, John, , referred to Hope only as baby girl in the weeks until Laura woke up. But having had a tracheotomy, feeding tubes fitted and spending  days on an ECMO Machine - the highest form of le support - Laura had a gruelling recovery learning how to do the most basic things before she was fit and healthy enough to go home.  She said: I was just lying in bed at first and not able to move at all. I tried really hard to lt my arms but I just couldnapost. It was frustrating because I couldnapost speak, but because I couldnapost move my arms or hands, I wasnapost able to write anything down that I wanted to say either. I had to learn to feed myself, brush my teeth, all the things you learn as a toddler, itaposs like learning everything all over again.  Finally ing to see her family and friends again on Monday, Laura was re-united with her parents Lynn and Bill, her three year old son, William, baby Hope and her two step-children.Now she says sheaposd recommend the jab to any pregnant women. Iaposd say just get it, she said. I wouldnapost wish whataposs happened to me on anyone and itaposs better to be safe than sorry.

Carlene Booth, from Glasgow, says she was too heavy for her bed that the slats fell down each night and she had to sleep in the spare room away from her husband. The -year-old said she started gaining weight as a child and developed a food addiction. The banking associate says she kept using this coping mechanism through adulthood as she came to weigh  stone and lbs. The stress from going into lockdown also caused her to binge. Now, Carlene has dropped five and a half stone and went from a UK dress size of  to  after undergoing gastric sleeve surgery. Carlene said: I was beginning to feel so disgusted in myself that I would sleep in the spare room bed away from my husband Robert at night because I was taking up so much room. “I was too heavy for our main bed and the slats would fall down every night. I would wake myself up breathless at night from turning in bed.” The mum-of-one said she also started to feel isolated from her friends because they were thinner than her.  In January  she decided enough was enough and took matters into her own hands. She said: It was January  - another new year where I was promising myself I would get fit and healthy. “I could barely move, my face and arms felt like they were going to burst as I was so swollen. “I was terried of catching Covid as I was extremely breathless and would constantly worry about being unable to breathe.  “One Friday night in January I was feeling so depressed and hopeless, I googled aposhelp from GP for weight lossapos and realised that I could pay privately for weight loss surgery. I knew there and then that I was going to have a sleeve.” The gastric sleeve is a weight-loss procedure where the stomach is reduced to about  per cent of its original size. The surgery involves removing a large portion of the stomach. Carlene said: My husband has always thought I was beautul and never put me down for my weight.  “He agreed to help me and I started the process again with clinics in the UK - and eventually decided on a company called Tonic Surgery and had my surgery five weeks later.” Following the surgery, Carlene adapted her diet and lestyle to maintain the weight loss. She said: The first two weeks post-surgery were just liquids - like protein shakes or broths - and then it was two weeks of pureed food while the staple lining of the stomach healed.  “Now I can eat anything but in very small portions such as a side plate or small bowl. “In terms of exercise, I try to walk every day and do muscle-strengthening workouts such as body pumps.” Now she feels more confident and no longer sleeps in the spare room. She said: It has -per cent changed my le in so many ways.  Carlene continued: I no longer view food in the same way now, food is fuel and helps to keep me alive and well whereas before it was slowly killing me. “I do things now without even thinking about it - silly things like playing football with my eight-year-old son Bobby. Before I wouldnapost have been able to. I am forever grateful for my sleeve.” She added: I am learning to love myself again. “Body dysmorphia is a huge struggle for weight loss surgery patients. Some days I forget that I have lost -pounds and still expect to struggle with the most basic tasks like showering. “I look in the mirror sometimes and still see a massive girl - but then I fit into my size  clothes and I have to give myself a reality check. It will be a lelong journey but I am getting there day by day.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Fitness\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Every winter there is a rise in common colds and other respiratory infections.Earlier in the Autumn Brits were dealing with theworst cold ever , after theto schools and the end of coronavirus restrictions. But now coronavirus infections are rising, and with the new Omicron iant on the rise, Brits need to make sure their colds arenapost actually Covid.Although believed to be more transmissible, there have been reports that Omicron is causing mild symptoms. So how can you be sure itaposs a cold and not Covid  Hereaposs everything you need to know. What are the symptoms of Omicron   The symptoms of the Omicron iant of coronavirus appear to be very dferent from previous strains, according to researchers. Some are reporting mild symptoms that are dferent the Delta strain.Early reports show Omicron has five district symptoms of its own, which are:A scratchy throat sore throat A dry cough Extreme tiredness Mild muscle aches Night sweatsHowever, according to the NHS website, there are still three main recognised symptoms of Covid. They are: A high temperature A new, continuous cough A loss or change to your sense of smell or tasteWhat are the symptoms of a cold   According to the NHS, the symptoms of a cold can come on gradually, and include:A blocked or runny nose A sore throatHeadachesMuscle aches Coughs A raised temperature Pressure in your ears and face Loss of taste and smellHow can you tell the dference between a cold and Covid   As many of the symptoms of Covid and a cold are the same, it can be tricky to know which ones you have. Professor Tim Spector previously appeared on This Morning to clear up any confusion.He explained to Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield: “Many people - perhaps up to half of cases - are going unrecognised because they basically have symptoms that are very cold-like. So headache, sore throat, runny nose, sneezing - and the only one that gets into the top five is loss of smell or taste.Weaposre now seeing that fever is very low down on the ranking of what weaposre seeing at the moment. Even rarer are things like shortness of breath or a persistent cough. Itaposs a combination of factors but weaposve got to face the reality which is, most people out there with Covid are presenting with cold-like symptoms.” What should you doyou have Covid symptoms   Itaposs incredibly important thatyou have any of the symptoms of Covid-, including the ones associated with Omicron, you should get tested. Professor Tim Spector, from Britain’s Covid Zoe app, said it was more important than ever to get tested. Data from the Zoe study app suggests that about half of all the Delta cases are being missed because they donapost present the classic Covid symptoms. He added: Omicron is probably more, much more similar to the mild iants we’re seeing in people who have been vaccinated with delta than anything . And so it is going to be producing cold-like symptoms that people won’t recognise as Covidthey just believe the official government advice. Professor Irene Petersen, a professor of epidemiology and health informatics at University College London , added: “A runny nose and headache are symptoms of many infections, but may also be the first symptoms – and only symptoms – of Covid. Therefore,you have these symptoms, I’d encourage you to use lateral flow testsfor a couple of days.The only way to know the dference for sure is to take a Covid test. You can order a free PCR test off the government website.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CoronavirusOmicron iant\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

They had been asking for me by name and making comments about having a haircut in Swansea, the salon prides itself on being an open and welcoming safe space and on that day it wasnapost.  Because of this, Gemma decided it would be best to cancel the future appointment, but this resulted in an email airing the customeraposs complaints including personal attacks on the salon owneraposs character.A screenshot of the email was shared on social media. It read: I actually find it pretty hilarious that you thought I would still come to the appt after your disgraceful behaviour, I was quite nervous anyway about risking a tacky Swansea hair salon touching my hair as I normally go to brooks and brooks in London, but after meeting you I just thought Iaposd not turn up to match your ignorance. The message went on to criticise the hairdresseraposs decision toto Swansea after working where arguing its fairly clear from meeting you, your attitude most likely got you kicked out  The customer then goes on to list their version of the events so that the owner can maybe grow a little. It did not stop there though, as the customer complained they tried to make things nicer and find a solution but incorrect information led to the situation. They added: People like you always know they are wrong deep down and feel ashamed of their behaviour but act ignorantly as an easy get out and you probably live in denial with most areas of your le. Hopefully one day youaposll wake up and realise what a disgrace you are and change. Iaposll keep my fingers crossed for you. All the best little brat, they said. The letter greatly upset Gemma, but sheaposs now planning to put the unfortunate situation behind her, saying: Iaposm really proud of where I am from and we hear comments talking about Swansea in a negative light, asit is any dferent where other salons are based. Itaposs just a more dficult time for everyone, that community feel has gone to an extent during the pandemic and small businesses have to stand by their morals otherwise we wonapost last It just speaks for itself, I donapost want conflict with anyone so we are leaving it at that and putting it behind us, its not who we are as a salon and my priority is my team.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

It sees her throw a huge Christmas lunch for all her loved ones at Buckingham Palace - with about  members of The Firm attending aposs festivities. This year, the party will reportedly hopefully take place next Tuesday at Windsor Castle, rather than Buckingham Palace, where the Queen is currently in residence.It is said it will see Her Majesty host an evening with wine, crackers and a feast inside the castle with extended family — before going to Sandringham, Norfolk, for Christmas itself. And even though children such as Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Mia Tindall are invited to the event, they donapost sit with the other royals. Instead, they have their own room, where they enjoy their Christmas meal, according to Mike Tindall, husband of the Queenaposs granddaughter Zara Tindall.In , the former rugby player spoke about the celebrations on his rugby podcast, and shared a few exciting details.

His co-stars James Haskell and Alex Payne asked which of the seven tables he sat. They asked: Do you find yourself upgrading every year and getting closer to the main table or are you off out the back  Is there a promotion and relegation based on the yearaposs performance  Becausethere is I imagine youaposre pretty much sitting on the right-hand side of Her Majesty. Mike stayed quiet throughout the jokes, but later added: I was on Prince Charlesaposs table, it was lovely.  He then ulged that the royal little ones have their own table in a separate room away from the adults. He said: This is the family lunch, there were seven tables so there must have been about  of us there. The kiddies have their own little one in a dferent room. It is understood that this year, three of her four newest great-grandchildren - August Brooksbank, Lucas Tindall and Sienna Mapelli Mozzi - are expected to be at the party. The Queen will then go to Sandringham via helicopter for Christmas.Last month, the Queen told her family she is well enough to host Christmas at Sandringham after recovering from a back sprain.She assured them she is feeling “far better” and is “looking forward” to the traditional festive get together at her Norfolk estate. Concern for the Queen’s health has been heightened in recent months after she pulled out of a number of major engagements.

The monarch is still to make a final decision on whether to hold her traditional pre-Christmas family get together next Tuesday. Plans are fully in place for the festive lunch the monarch hosts each year for her extended family, and preparations are underway. However, royal sources said it was “unlikely” to go ahead in full form,at all, in the face of the rising Covid cases and the surge in the Omicron iant.  Her Majesty, who is still planning to host Christmas for her immediate family at Sandringham in Norfolk, is understood to be considering whether holding the party with a reduced guest list would work. Both gatherings last year were unable to take place because of the Covid- crisis. Most years, the Queen invites her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren to join her at Buckingham Palace before she departs for her annual Christmas stay at Sandringham The pre-Christmas celebration gives the head of state a chance to catch up with relatives who are unable to travel to Norfolk for Christmas Day.  The wider family is also usually invited, including the Queen’s cousins - the Gloucesters, the Duke of Kent and the Michaels of Kent. A royal source said: “The Queen has been very much looking forward to both the party and welcoming her family for Christmas at Sandringham. “The Windsor party is very much in the balance and everything is focussed on being able to enjoy Christmas in the safest way possible.“The Queen is very mindful of the rapid rates of coronavirus in the community and will take the appropriate measures.” Any of the guests at the Christmas party or Sandringham holidays will be asked to take lateral flow tests before coming, it is understood. Members of the royal family take regular covid tests in line with their work.Senior royals have agreed to rally round the monarch in the lead up to the festive period, as it will be her first Christmas since the death of her beloved husband of  years, Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh.The -year-old monarch The Queen is still carrying out only light duties, including virtual and the occasional in-person audiences, after being ordered to rest by royal doctors and spending a night in hospital undergoing tests on October . She on Wednesday welcomed in person to Windsor Castle the Sultan of Oman, Haitham bin Tariq al Said and his we The Honourable Lady Sayyida Ahad Bint Abdullah Bin Hamad Al Busaidiyah. The monarch, wearing a pale blue dress, her trademark pearls and a sapphire brooch, was pictured smiling and shaking hands with the Sultan at her Berkshire castle.

This means,you test positive while at your familyaposs home over the festive period, you must remain there for  days starting from the day your symptoms began or the day you had the testyou did not have symptoms.You can find out more about how long to self-isolate here.If you have tested positive you should inform the NHS and anyone you have been in close contact with for the past  hours to ensure they can get tested. These contacts are not required to self-isolate unless they are contacted by the NHS Test and Trace service.  Does everyone in your family home or household have to self-isolateyou test positive for COVID- If you live with someone with Covid, you will not need to self-isolateyou meet any of the following criteria: you are fully vaccinated , you are under  years and six months old, you are taking part or have taken part in a Covid vaccine trial or you are not able to get vaccinated for medical reasons. If iniduals meet any of the above conditions, those fully vaccinated are advised to do daily rapid lateral flow tests for seven days, limit social contact with anyone at higher risk from Covid and follow advice on how to avoid catching and spreading the virus. However, NHS Test and Trace will contact anyone who has come into contact with someone with Covid by phone, email, text or through the NHS Covid- app and inform themthey need to self-isolate. If someone is contacted by NHS Test and Trace, they are required to self-isolate, eventhey are fully vaccinated. NHS Test and Trace will advise iniduals on the self-isolation procedures depending on their vaccination status.  What do I dosomeone in my household tests positive  Do I need to isolate as well  The government updated its guidance on Tuesday. It reads: If you live in the same household as someone with COVID-, and you are aged over  years and  months and not fully vaccinated, you are legally required to self-isolate. This does not applyyou have taken part in or are currently part of an approved COVID- vaccine trial or you are not able to get vaccinated for medical reasons. Do not go to work, school, or public areas and do not use public transport or taxis. Your isolation period includes the day the first person in your household’s symptoms startedand the next  full days. This means that , for example, your  day isolation period starts on the th of the month, your isolation period ends at .pm on the th and you canto your normal routine. The government reiterated that they class a household as either:one person living alone a group of peopleliving at the same address and who share cooking facilities, bathrooms or toilets, or living areas and may include students in boarding schools or halls of residence groups of people who share a nomadic way of le for example those who live on Traveller sites, in vehicles or on canal boats WhatI get the Omicron Covid iant Omicron is rapidly becoming the most dominant iant around parts of the country and therefore positive cases are likely to be this new strain. It is likely to become the dominant strain in the UK in a matter of days. The rules for Omicron and other Covid iants are all the same - and therefore you do not need to take any extra stepsyou have Omicron or not. The World Health Organisationhas said PCR tests can detect Omicron infections. The Omicron iant has multiple mutations to its spike protein, which is found on the virus’s surface. The spike protein plays a role in infecting cells and most PCR tests target several parts of the viral genome, including the S-gene that encodes the spike protein. The new iant appears to cause milder cold-like symptoms. With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email. Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here.Can I travel abroad this Christmas The red travel list will be scraped in England, according to the Health Secretaryaposs announcement on Tuesday. Mr Javid revealed it will no longer be necessary to block arrivals from the  banned countries where Omicron has been discovered, given there are now thousands of cases of the iant already in Britain. In terms of travelling abroad, you are able to travel abroad as you wish - depending on the rules of the country you intend to travel to. There are currently  countries that have essentially banned UK visitors, including Australia and New Zealand. Can I take daily tests and leave isolation early If your rapid lateral flow test comes back positive, you should continue to self-isolate until you get the result of the PCR test. Evenyour PCR test is negative, you may need to quarantine. In England,you do the PCR test within two days of a positive rapid lateral flow test and your PCR test is negative, you can stop self-isolating. If you do the PCR test later than this, youaposll need to self-isolate for  full days evenyou get a negative PCR result.What should you do about childcareyou have to self-isolate Those aged under  years and six months old are not required to self-isolatethey live with or have been in contact with someone with Covid. According to the latest guidance, anyone aged five years and over who lives in the same household as someone with COVID- and who is not legally required to self-isolate is now strongly advised to take a lateral flow test every day for seven days. If any of these LFD tests are positive they should self-isolate in order to protect other people. WhatI need to go to work to pay my bills You are required to stay at homeyou have tested positive for coronavirus - this means you cannot go to work, school, other public areas or use public transport.The government says you may be entitled to a one-off payment of £ through the NHSTest and Trace Support Payment schemeyou are required to stay at home and self-isolate and unable to go to work.

Since the iant was first detected on November  cases have skyrocketed - and on Wednesday a record-breaking , new Covid- cases were confirmed in the UK.Speaking at a Number  press conference, Boris Johnson warned Omicron cases are doubling every two days in some areas and once again urged people to get their booster jab. London is now seeing a sharp increase in the numbers of positive cases, with data from the Zoe Covid app showing cases rise sharper than in the first wave.Some .% of a sample of new coronavirus cases in London with specimen dates for December  and  were found to have S gene target failure- a way of detecting the likely presence of Omicron. Most samples of Omicron that have been sequenced in a laboratory have been found to contain a slight but identiable dference from other Covid- iants such as Delta. This dference - a deletion in the S gene - shows up in certain laboratory PCR tests and can be used as way of estimating the spread of Omicron. Of the , Covid- cases in London recorded on December  and  where the S gene status could be determined,  were classed as SGTF.  The figures, which have been published by the UK Health Security Agency, also show that .% of a sample of detectable cases in eastern England from December  and  were classed as SGTF, along with .% in south-east England and .% in north-west England. A graph put together by Oliver Johnson, Professor of Information Theory at the School of Mathematics, University of Bristol, plots the Covid cases reported by London onto a graph. Publishing it on Twittter, he said “since we know that omicron is growing at a similar rate in most regions, with ious places being about a week behind London.  Then it might be prudent to imagine that the next few places on this list might also see a big steepening in cases in the next week.” Levels were lower in all other regions, with north-east England having the lowest estimate of .%. The level for the whole of England was estimated at .%. All figures are based only on samples tested at four of the UK Lighthouse laboratories - Alderley Park, Glasgow, Milton Keynes and Newcastle - which means there are likely to be parts of the country where the prevalence of Omicron is underreported.Prof Tim Spector, an epidemiologist, told BBC Radio ’s Today programme: “In London, where Covid is increasing rapidly, itaposs far more likely to be Covid than it is to be a cold.“We’re seeing doubling in the numbers equivalent to what’s being seen where, every two-and-a-half days, and that really means numbers are going up. “If we look at our regional charts we see London accelerating more than we’ve seen it since the very first wave and this now means that Omicron is the predominant iant already. “We’ll be at  per cent very soon, so that’s happened in just a matter of days – that’s is why so many people are going down with infections.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Coronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The TikToker, who goes by Dumpster Diving Freegan, has shared footage of her finding hundreds of pounds worth of meat and produce that was reportedly tossed in the bin. In one video, she shows how she came across a -pound frozen turkey that cost £ . The US-based woman said: Last night I found enough meat to feed an entire community. I found everything from organic chicken and beef to Beyond meat. The woman also explained that finding perishable food in F or OC at night meant it was still super cold. She also explained that makes sure none of the items she finds were recalled. She continued: Everything had been thrown out on or before its best-buy date, and as we know, best-buy dates are not hard rules and everything was still good to consume. In addition to finding meat during this haul, she also found produce, yoghurt and homemade guacamole. The video has been viewed more than .million times.

I cannot even begin to imagine how much waste we DONaposT see that goes in compactors. Honestly shocking. Some did raise concerns about the safety and quality of the food, but the dumpster ing woman claims she knows what she is doing and has survived on scavenged food for nearly two years. Dumpster Diving Freegan, who has more than , TikTok followers, started dumpster ing when the Covid- pandemic stopped her from travelling for work. She said that while she was on the road, her meals were comped and got extra income and when the pandemic hit she was losing  to a month in additional income.  This meant she was no longer on track to save her goal of ,for a down payment on a house. She explained in a previous video: I tried to find ways to reduce my expenses, and my biggest expense next to my rent at the time was food. So I started looking up extreme ways to reduce my grocery bill. I was recommended a dumpster-ing video on YouTube, and I thought to myself, aposThereaposs no way this can be real.apos  And to my surprise, it is real. I havenapost paid for groceries in nearly two years, and I was able to achieve that down payment goal. Now I focus on bringing awareness. Dumpster Diving Freegan says all of her finds are within five miles of her house as she shares hauls from many dferent stores. In another video, she explains she donates  times more than what she keeps for herself and that she always leaves enough behind for others who are dumpster ing for food.

Kennedy has been released by the US Government.Historians - and conspiracy theorists - welcomed the move although it leaves more than , files either partially redacted or withheld entirely. The newly released papers include documents about killer Lee Harvey Oswaldaposs contact with a KGB agent two months before the shooting. They also include memos detailing anonymous phone calls to the US embassy in Canberra, Australia, a year before the shooting, where the caller said the Soviet Government was plotting to kill President Kennedy. Another call was placed on November , two days after the shooting, claiming the Russians were behind it.  In September , Oswald met with a KGB agent in Mexico City.The files were today released by the US National Archives, after months of delays by Joe Biden.The President had promised to make them public but then stalled, citing Covid backlogs as the reason. He delayed one scheduled release to protect against identiable harm to the military defence, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or the conduct of foreign relations that is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in the immediate disclosure. The move, first ordered by US Congress in  was made to ensure transparency of Government.  Initial viewing of the documents failed to provide a smoking gun that would substantively answer the circumstances surrounding Kennedyaposs death. Many Americans do not believe the Warren Commissionaposs official finding Kennedy was killed by a single man acting alone. Because it has taken [the government] so long to get these records out, no matter what comes out, no one is going to believe that thataposs it, said one official familiar with the classication concerns related to the documents. The Kennedy family is among those who have repeatedly called for all documents to be made public. Earlier this year, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., JFKaposs nephew, said some of the files would remain secret until next year.  The papers that will remain secret until next December have been flagged by national security agencies for further review. Kennedy was sitting in the backseat of a convertible with First Lady Jackie Kennedy when he was shot in the neck at .pm on November , . Former U.S. Marine Oswald was arrested for the assassination with police believing he shot from a nearby book depository where he was employed. The alleged killer was gunned down by Texas nightclub owner Jack Ruby while being transferred to the county jail, two days after the assassination.

Joleen Diaz, , from Calornia in the US, puts her youthful glow down to old-fashioned clean living. Originally from Guam, the high school teacher and mum-of-one moved to Calornia when she was  and has been single since splitting from daughter Meilani’s father  years ago. The Calornia local gets younger men sliding into her DMs on a regular basis, however she claims her youthful beauty has also meant people keep reporting her Hinge profile because they think sheaposs a catfish. “I’ve had my account deleted several times,” Joleen said. “It’s funny, I think people think I’m a fake account and report me.“I could link my Instagram to my profile, which would likely help prove that it’s really me but I don’t do it because I think my social media doesn’t present the simple, down-to-earth person I am.  “I’d like to be able to connect with someone and then explain my social media to them once they know me a bit more.aposJoleen isnapost short for male suitors, with over , followers on Instagram @joleendiazand frequent date invitations.“I do get younger men messaging me on my social media,” she said. “The majority of the messages are very polite and most are very complimentary and positive about me promoting a positive lestyle. “They do ask to go out on a date, maybe dinner or a hike, but I know that this is just curiosity and not a real intent on pursuing anything more than the narrative they think of me. “When younger men ask me out on dates, I find it equally as flattering as men my age or older asking me out. “I think it takes a lot of courage to approach someone and ask them to meet with you one-on-one. “I think some younger men tend to fantasise a bit more about what it would be like dating someone older, where men my age or older are more pragmatic and looking for someone to enjoy simple things in le.apos  However, Joleen isn’t interested in dating a toyboy. The mum said: “Age isn’t a deal-breaker for me, it’s about finding someone I’m able to help continue becoming a better person and growing, and them doing the same for me. “But I don’t want to date a toyboy. “I would never even remotely consider dating someone who is young enough to be friends with my daughter.” Joleen and Meilani are so close that when they are both in relationships they love going on double dates together. The mum said: “When we are both seeing people we will often go bowling, to the movies, hikes, to the beach. “We haven’t gone on a double date recently but she and I are very close so we definitely will again. “Melani asks for my advice on dating all the time. “I love that she trusts in the advice I give, I feel like she’s well-balanced in dating and I’m glad my experiences can help her out.” If anyone out there is considering sliding into Joleen’s DMs, she has some stipulations on the type of men she prefers. The mum added: “I gravitate towards ambitious, motivated men, someone who is confident, has a positive outlook and can communicate well. “They must be able to contribute equally, both financially and emotionally, in a relationship and they have to love dogs as I have a golden retriever. “They also must love being outdoors and being physically active.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationLoveSecondary schoolDating\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

When it arrived, Lily couldnapost wait to open the box but as soon as she did she was disappointed - as the tree looked sparse at the top and only got worse on the way down. Lily shared a video of her tree with her fans on TikTok and soon the video had been viewed more than three million times, with countless likes and comments.  What do you think about Lilyaposs Christmas tree  Let us know in the comments...Lily captioned her video: Kmart Australia, you have some explaining to do. She then shows the tree she bought, which instead of looking luscious as she thought it would, the tree barely had any branches and it attracted criticism online. One laughed and said it looked like “seaweed” but others said Lily simply needed to fluff out the tree. In a follow-up video, she did just that but complained the item still looked sad. But, eventually, Lily was able to make it work by enlisting a friend’s help and decorating the tree. She managed to cover the articial tree with baubles and tinsel which did the job.While Lily was disappointed, one British family got the fright of their le when a poisonous snake poked its head out from behind a bauble on their tree.Rob and Marcela Wild were admiring the tree with children Edward, , and Sahara, six, when they spotted the deadly boomslang nestle between the tinsel at their home in Cape Town, South Africa.

One woman has revealed how her sister-in-law is charging a price per head for hosting a second Christmas dinner at her house, which many people would argue is fair enough - except people are completely ided on the price. The woman explained how she and her husband have hosted Christmas dinner for the family three times in the past, and during these times her sister-in-law has brought a course, a bottle of wine or even possibly offered £ towards the cost, but any food or drink they bring that isnapost consumed, theyaposll take home with them again.

The youngster managed to order ,worth of ice cream and cakes from Sydney’s Gelato Messina , including a personalised birthday cake. His dad Kris King said that the mammoth order included  cakes - and he thinks he was pre-planning for his upcoming birthday. Christian ordered the huge amount of food to his Mr Kingaposs workplace at the nearby fire station.“First of all I thought it was . And then I really looked at it and it was , and we almost had a bloody heart attack,” Mr King told Perth Now. “I flicked through the screen about  times. That’s how long the order was, it was like  cakes. “He actually told me he ordered a birthday cake for himself, and I didn’t even believe it. “I had steam coming out of my ears first of all, screaming his name down the street. He ran to his room before I told him so.” But despite the horror of realising what his son had done, Mr Kingaposs day was saved after UberEats agreed to pay the money back. Mr King had told Christian that Santa might not be delivering presents to their home this year after the massive order. “The icing on the cake was when UberEats said we’ll give you your money back,” Mr King said.  “ back in the good books and Santa is coming again.” And Christian wasnapost the only person who could have ended up on Santaaposs naughty list.In the UK a woman has taken to Mumsnet to ask what to do about her husband, who keeps giving their son his Christmas presents early. She said: Iaposve been saving my pennies for months and been so careful about what gts I pick for my son because I wanted things I know he would love and appreciate. I ended up with about four presents for him but each and everyone was thought out and special. I just want to make it a lovely memory for him and us... Only problem is my husband. About a week or two ago I left my husband to watch my son for a couple hours while I went to the hospital for an appointmentwhen I came back my husband had found hidden presents and opened it and gave it to my son!I was a bit annoyed but not too unhappy as it was only a bubble bath set so not one of the main presents! This morning however Iaposve woken up to my son playing with the most expensive and the present I was most excited about to see his reaction when he opens it on Christmas morning!She added: Iaposve saved and shopped and planned everything to make this special and he keeps ruining it! I donapost have a lot of money to keep replacing gts at this rate my little one will have nothing left to open on Christmas Day. More than  people responded to her post, with many outraged by the husbandaposs behaviour.

The Parker Solar Probe touched the sun when it breached the outer atmosphere, and managed to sample particles and magnetic fields there.The new milestone marks one major step for Parker Solar Probe and one giant leap for solar science, according to a NASA release. The probe faced unimaginable temperatures of Fand radiation  times stronger than here on Earth. The flight occurred in April but scientists have only just been able to confirm the probe traveled through the corona. They had to wait months for the data to arrive back from the spacecraft. The achievement will help us uncover critical information about our closest star and its influence on the solar system, scientists said.  Parker Solar Probe apostouching the Sunapos is a monumental moment for solar science and a truly remarkable feat, said Thomas Zurbuchen, the associate administrator for NASAaposs Science Mission Directorate, in a statement at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union. Not only does this milestone provide us with deeper insights into our Sunaposs evolution andimpacts on our solar system, but everything we learn about our own star also teaches us more about stars in the rest of the universe. New research gathered from the solar milestone, which cost NASA .billion, has now been included in the Physical Review Letters.  Fascinatingly exciting, said project scientist Nour Raouafi of Johns Hopkins University. As it circles closer to the solar surface, Parker is making new discoveries that other spacecraft were too far away to see, including from within the solar wind – the flow of particles from the Sun that can influence us at Earth. The first and most dramatic time we were below for about five hours... Now you might think five hours, that doesnapost sound big, the University of Michiganaposs Justin Kasper told reporters.  But he noted that Parker was moving so fast it covered a vast distance during that time, tearing along at more than  milesper second. The first passage through the corona – and the promise of more flybys to come – will continue to provide data on phenomena that are impossible to study from afar. Iaposm excited to see what Parker finds as it repeatedly passes through the corona in the years to come, said Nicola Fox, ision director for the Heliophysics Division at NASA Headquarters. The opportunity for new discoveries is boundless. It is a really important region to get into because we think all sorts of physics potentially turn on, Kasper said. And now weaposre getting into that region and hopefully going to start seeing some of these physics and behaviors.

In a statement, the force said: During the investigation, it was found that dolphins and whales were utilized for entertainment purposes during the month of August, without being authorized to do so following an amendment to the Criminal Code under Bill S- on June , . Animal rights group Animal Justice claimed the investigation into Marineland had been sparked by its own legal complaint about the water park over concerns its dolphin performances violated the Criminal Code. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here According to the group, the dolphin shows featured animals performing tricks, staff riling up the cheering crowd and loud pop music. Back in October, Camille Labchuk, executive director of Animal Justice, said: Authorities must step in to investigate whether Marineland’s dolphin performances violate federal laws protecting dolphins from being forced to participate in demeaning performances. Speaking to Global News on Monday, she added that the group is concerned for the safety and wellbeing of animals still at the park amid reports Marineland is up for sale. The group has called on the government to intervene and rescue the animals still living at Marineland so they can be sent to a sanctuarythe park is sold.  They want to ensure none of the animals end up at another marine park where theyaposre likely to be exploited for entertainment. Marineland has been in hot water for some time after one of it killer whales, Kiska, was filmed banging her head against the side of her tank earlier this year. Footage showed the orca appearing to be incredibly distressed after five of her babies had died. The park has been at the centre of allegations of mistreatment of animals for decades, and former employees have protested outside its premises for several years. The Toronto Star published accusations against Marineland in  which sparked investigations, but it was reported that authorities found no issues of concern at the time. Allegations against the park span as far back as  when the US Department of Fisheries seized six bottlenose dolphins after they had been illegally caught by the parkaposs owner, John Holer, off the Gulf of Mexico.

I can understand that this must be absolutely hellish.“In the short term we need to do something immediately about trying to discourage people from parking in inappropriate places and I’m more than happy to take that forward to the community action teamwith the police.“I think in the medium term we need to be trying to encourage people, when there are peak times, to not park there but to park down in the town.”Also at this week’s meeting was Emma Guy from Enduro World Series , who formerly worked as project coordinator for the Tweed Valley Tourism Bid..removeShe said: “I’m well aware of this issue and some of us [from Tweed Valley Tourism Bid] did try and tackle it on the ground about a year and a half ago with putting signs up near the Cauld.“So around the event at the beginning of October we had shuttles so people wouldn’t park in these hotspots, we cordoned off areas, we spoke to the golf club and we had marshals in place to police any bad behaviour, so tat worked quite well.“Our kind of feeling is that this is an ongoing problem and it does need solutions, there needs to be some kind of visitor infrastructure investment and certainly in my role with the Tourism Bid we were pushing really hard for that.“From an EWS point of view, with regard to events, we worked quite hard to manage that problem because we know how disruptive and how unpleasant that can be.“In my role with EWS we would support and put our weight behind any proposals to the council to SOSEto try and alleviate this.”Tweeddale East councillor Shona Haslam, of the Conservatives, added: “In terms of the long term [solution] obviously we’ve got £ million coming into mountain biking infrastructure into Innerleithen and £ million for a town the size of Innerleithen is pretty signicant.“So, we’ve got the Mountain Biking Innovation Centre that is moving forward in the background, obviously there’s a lot of commercial stuff in there that we’re not allowed to talk about, and there is the bike park as well.

Is it the same as enjoying the embarrassment of your granny cheering from the front row  Or as rewarding as seeing the pride on the faces of family members as you collect your certicate on stage with a smile and a handshake  Of course not. Nothing about school le post-fire post during COVID seems as rewarding or real as it once did but, be in no doubt, the young people celebrated here today are every bit as worthy of celebration and congratulations as their predecessors and perhaps even more so given all they have had to overcome and deal with to win the prizes we celebrate in this article.Perhaps you can take heart that this year’s Peebles High School prize giving offers something more permanent than fleeting moments of adulation and applause. It offers an article than can be cherished for years to come as a reminder of how our young people triumphed against the odds. Who knows, perhaps in years to come one of this year’s prize winners will be a granny or grandpa waving this copy of the Peeblesshire in the front row shouting, “I won that same prize in – prizes really meant something in my day.” Perhaps that is a bit fancul but, as your head teacher, I want to thank each and every one of you for succeeding in tough times and bringing such pride and honour to our school. Well done.And well done too to our higher journalism class and their teacher, Ms Ness, for the hard work that brings you this celebration of our fantastic young people.

The winner of the Maigret Cup this year is Thomas Neville. Thomas has won this award through his success studying Spanish and French at Higher level. The class was fortunate enough to interview Thomas regarding the award and asked him how he felt to have won this. He said: “I’m really impressed with myself, obviously the award for overall linguist is really prestigious, and I’m really chuffed with myself as there is obviously a lot of languages at this school so to have won the best overall award for languages is something that I’m really proud of.”By Harry NessAmy Brown: Outstanding Musical ContributionOn November  the class interviewed former Peebles High School student Amy Brown to discuss her achievement of the Outstanding Musical Contribution Award. This is presented in recognition of the huge commitment made to the extra curricular le of the school and is awarded to a pupil who have been a source of inspiration to their fellow musicians throughout their time at Peebles. She was delighted to have won, even though she only took music for enjoyment and went on to express her disappointment at not being able to perform fully last year. She graciously stated that she was glad pupils are “able to get back to that now and other people are enjoying it”. While Amy is not pursuing music further , she explained that “it’s not something I want to stop doing… It was probably one of my favourite subjects, probably the one I was most relaxed aboutthat makes sense. It was always a nice environment to be in and I think that helped me enjoy it a lot more”. Amy then admitted at the risk of sounding “cliché”, that the music department concerts were the highlight of her years at the school. At the end of the interview, she imparted some very wise advice for younger years. She said: “Have more confidence in yourself, don’t care as much about what other people think.”By Madeleine HubertChristopher O’Hare: George OB Thomson Memorial CupThis award was created by professor George Thompson, who taught in the English department at Peebles High School. He devoted large parts of his research to the study of pupils with additional needs and was always adamant that they should be integrated into the “le and work of the whole school”. The council of Tweeddale wanted to celebrate the late professor George Thompson by awarding this memorial quaich to the most creative and enterprising entry from pupils with additional needs for a project devised by the school in conjunction with the society. When the class interviewed Christopher he said he felt “brilliant and honoured” to receive this award. He told us that one teacher that improved Christopher’s school le was Mr Travis, from the technology department. Christopher described him as a “funny guy” and “nice person”, who he says is happy to help whenever. He added that design and manufacture was his favourite subject as it enabled him to unleash his creativity. Not only is Christopher creative, but funny too, and when asked what his act in a school talent show would be he replied: “I like to make people laugh and feel happy”. Finally, Christopher was asked what he wishes to do in the future. Filled with energy, he stated that he would like to join the army. The skills and qualities which Christopher has shown in order to gain this award will help him achieve his future plans. The school wishes Christopher all the best, and know he will do well in the world which anxiously awaits his talent, kindness and phenomenal humour.By Keeley RippinBen Rorison: George OB Thomson Memorial Cup, and Balfour Medal This year’s worthy prize winner of the Balfour Medal and the George OB Thomson cup is Ben Rorison. Both prizes are awarded to an inidual with a positive presence and creative outlook within their community and school le. This was an area in which Ben excelled. When asked how he felt about receiving both awards Ben stated that he was “shocked and delighted to have been picked”. Ben also mentioned that his favourite subject was music and that he wanted to pursue this by becoming a music teacher for those with additional needs. When asked what his favourite memory was at Peebles High, Ben said is was helping first year pupils and helping around the school as a prefect, just showing how deserving of this prize Ben is. The positive impact that Ben had on the school will stay with those students he helped and the teachers he worked with. The school has no doubt that Ben will continue to be a role model and inspiration to all who are fortunate enough to work with him.By Olivia ThornburrowAbbie Sorrell: Geoffrey Simpson Award for Head PrefectOne winner of the Geoffrey Simpson award is ex-head girl Abbie Sorrell. The class’ first question regarded the important issue of who her favourite teacher was. She replied: “I don’t really do favourites, butI had to choose it would be Lesley Johnson. Chemistry used to be one of my weaker subjects , however I learned to love it and always looked forward to her classes”. However, she may have been won over in another way as she finishes her reply with “cake days were always a firm favourite of mine too”.Abbie was asked what her favourite memory of Peebles High School was and she responded enthusiastically “the German exchange trip”. She added: “I went as a member of the choir and loved meeting like-minded people and embracing a dferent culture. Not to mention the infamous Loch Lomond song which was always a favourite of mine.”When asked about her future plans, Abbie replied: “Wow, thinking about the future seems so daunting, however I hope that my uni degree will allow me to work in a hospital environment where I can help people. I also love the idea of travel and going on adventures to make some memories.”The class asked Abbie to reflect on and offer advice to her first year self, and she responded with “the list is long… the main thing I’d say is not to be so hard on myself and to accept that set backs are important for learning just as much as success”. Carrying on the theme of advice Abbie was asked what she would say to this year’s head team and she told them to “embrace everything because the year will be over before you know it. Therefore, just make the most of every opportunity and most of all enjoy yourself and have fun working with your peers”.By Rosie DykesEuan Macrae: Geoffrey Simpson Award for Head PrefectEuan Macrae was awarded the prestigious Geoffrey Simpson Award for his efforts as head boy. Euan had to show certain skills such as leadership and teamwork in order to effectively guide the school. In an interview with Euan, who is now studying Medicine at University, he highlighted how the school fire and COVID had affected his work ethic during his final few years in school, and how this has impacted the lives of not only himself but also his year group going into exams and beyond. He explained that “we’d never sat proper higher exams which would have set us up for the bigger exams that we were going to have to sit further down the line so the damage from that is probably still lasting”. The class asked Euan who his hero was, he very honestly answered with his grandfather, saying that he had always looked up to him due to his intelligence and bravery. When asked who his favourite teacher was at school, Euan passionately discussed how Miss Dunlop, who taught history, influenced his high school experience as “she had the entire class focused on what she was saying and she never even had to raise her voice. I soon realised that learning could be actually so much fun as well as informative”.By Louise RussellRachel McManus: Tweed Reads PrizeCampbell Hunter was a much-loved member of the Peebles community. He made fantastic contributions to the Tweed Reads organisation and thrived under the leadership role. He was kind, compassionate and showed a real love of encouraging the younger generations to explore and enjoy reading. Campbell worked tirelessly alongside the other members of Tweed Reads and valued the importance of learning, community and service. Campbell was such an important part of the community, and his astounding contribution to Tweed Reads only proved how far he was set to go outside of school.The Tweed Reads prize is named after Campbell Hunter, not just to honour his memory but to honour everything he stood for and his contributions to the Tweed Reads club. The prize is awarded to the few who epitomise Campbell’s wonderful leadership qualities and share his values of learning and community. The Campbell Hunter prize for  goes to Rachel McManus who consistently worked creatively within the confines of COVID regulations and was always relentlessly positive.When the class asked Rachel about the prize itself and how she felt to have won it, she described Campbell as “a huge part of Tweed Reads in his last few years of high school and had a real passion for helping young children in the community develop their reading skills and form a love for reading”. Rachel says she feels “honoured to have won the Campbell Hunter prize through Tweed Reads” and she hopes to continue her involvement with the organisation in coming years.When asked in an interview how the fire and pandemic affected her work ethic within school she replied it had “a massive impact on students”. She then went on to congratulate the school saying it has “worked hard to ensure that pupils were still able to have a good amount of teaching with being online and there was always support available should anyone have needed it”. Rachel closed her answer by admitting that “it was hard to concentrate on work at home, so you really had to push yourself to stay motivated and keep on top of the workload”.Rachel was asked how she felt the award carried on Campbell’s legacy.

year, opting instead to spend the £ it would cost to dress a living Christmas tree next winter – “like every other town in East Lothian” – leaving the town without a tree this year.However, following a backlash by locals criticising the group’s failure to light up the town, the community group confirmed that a temporary tree would indeed be installed at Coronation Gardens later this week.Historically, a Christmas tree has been displayed at the war memorial however, due to ongoing refurbishment at Civic Square, the space cannot be decorated this year.Additionally, permanent lights – which the community council arranged to have installed on two trees in the town – have suffered delays due to Storm Arwen, but the group “remains hopeful this will be resolved soon”.An online statement by the group said: “The community council has become aware of a series of provocative posts on other local social media pages about the town’s Christmas lights.“The current community council was only formed in October, following public elections in September.“The previous committee took the decision in  not to pay out the usual £ for a temporary Christmas tree and put that money towards a living Christmas tree and towards permanently dressing with lights some mature living deciduous trees in the town.“The cost for tree-dressing is in the region of £, per tree.“Two trees were dressed for us by independent contractors in late autumn but are still awaiting connection to nearby lampposts by East Lothian Council electricians.“This is work the previous CC executive team valiantly attempted to have put in place for several months prior to their departure and the new CC executive team are still chasing for completion.”Following a review of the  lights for lampposts – currently stored away – a member discovered that many were in an unsuitable condition for display.The lights cost the team more than £, when purchased several years ago.Additionally, brackets and sockets to hang the lights are missing from lampposts.The statement added: “A decision was taken to trust that East Lothian Council would be good to its word for the - Christmas season and connect up the two new trees, allowing us to invest this money in dressing more permanent deciduous trees next year.”Fiona O’Donnell, ward councillor, said: “I am pleased that there will be some Christmas lights in Prestonpans this year.“I know that the community were keen to see this happen after such a dficult year.“Going forward, I want to work with the community council to explore how we make sure that there will be Christmas lights in future years.“We can learn from the example of the gala committee, who work all year round to make the Prestonpans Gala a real highlight of the year.“The exchanges on social media have been helpfulin explaining what is involved and how other communities arrange for lights in their area.“I think there is an understanding that having Christmas lights in the town will need volunteers fromthe local community.“Panners always step up when their community needs them and I am confident that we can work together to build on what we have this year and make it even better in future years.”The community council added: “It’s worth remembering that the members are unpaid volunteers.“Like those iniduals posting nonsense, we have jobs, lives, hobbies, family and other things to be getting on with too.“Like everyone who lives in the town, young or old, recent arrival or th-generation Panner, we all want to create a beautul, peaceful and happy town for us all to live, work and grow old in.”A number of Facebook users responded to the statement, with one stating: “Folk are going to voice their opinions as there has been no communication to inform the community that this decision was made.”Another said: “It’s a sad state of affairs when other community councils can organise to have lovely Xmas lights on lampposts but Prestonpans and Port Seton can’t.”Another said: “Why has it taken for comments made on other media pages for you to put up a statement  When were you going to let the town know we were not getting the Christmas lights

Coming in at just under £, for the four-wheel-drive version, the Duster offers great value-for-money alongside genuine go-anywhere ability.These Duster models can only be specied in mid-level Comfort trim, which means you get a host of creature comforts as standard, including -inch wheels and an eight-inch infotainment display.Suzuki VitaraSuzuki, much like Dacia, is another manufacturer with a close eye on value. The Vitara has been a core part of the firms range for some time, but the most recent model has really moved the game forwards with a sharp new look and plenty of interior tech.But most importantly for this list, its available with Suzukis AllGrip all-wheel-drive system, which helps to give added traction while still maintaining a good level of economy.Land Rover DefenderLand Rover might have had a tricky job on its hands replacing the iconic Defender, but it appears that it has more than lived up to the challenge. The new Defender has captured some of the sparkle of the original but brought it into the modern age with a more refined driving experience without diminishing any of that much-needed off-road prowess.Available in short and long wheelbases - badged  and  respectively - the Defender is brimmed with off-road technology that allows it to adapt to and overcome all manner of conditions.Jeep WranglerJeeps Wrangler is something of an icon in the four-wheel-drive segment, having progressed and evolved from the original Willys Jeep. These days, its more grown-up than ever, but retains its robust and impressive off-road technology.Its also available in short and long wheelbases, while the option to remove pretty much every exterior  turns driving the Wrangler into a real occasion - though you may want to keep them attached during winter.Subaru ForesterSubarus presence here in Scotland might not be the largest, but the cars it makes manage to provide a great compromise between good on-road manners and credible off-road characteristics. The Forester is a great example. Its comfortable when youre on the tarmac, but clever all-wheel-drive technology ensures that it can keep moving over tricky surfaces too.Its spacious and practical, while a mild-hybrid powertrain can help to bring fuel use down.Mercedes G-ClassThe latest G-Class loses none of the charm and presence of the original but delivers a high-end driving experience as a bonus.

So, the contestants need to be constantly paying attention to get the answers right.Its a fun show for viewers to join in with from the sofa, but the competitors have the chance to win big money. If they correctly remember the things theyve seen and heard minutes earlier, they can add more cash to their prize pot.Then theres the chaotic finale of each episode, where we see the remaining two contestants setting each other questions.Here we catch up with Londoner Carr, who welcomed a son with partner Karoline Copping in .WHAT MAKES I LITERALLY JUST TOLD YOU STAND OUT AS A GAME SHOW The contestants are crazy good. I dont know where we found these people, but we searched high and low.Its got an enormous play-at-home factor, which most game shows dont have. Most game shows are binary, you either know the answer or you dont - all you have to know for this show is whats just happened. And we had real fun with the fact that anything can happen. You can have -second cameos, you can have  ad breaks, you can mess with peoples minds.IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ENJOYED CATCHING PEOPLE OUT...Yeah, the misdirects are good - its comedic. I think the best bit of the show is the end round. Ive never seen another game show do that, where you go, Oh, youre setting each other questions.We preyed upon the fact that when you come and do a TV show, you dont know whats normal. So we did some very abnormal things. Like, someone from Girls Aloud just walks through the room for no reason at all. Its crazy, but it sort of works, because people just go Well, I guess its telly - who knows The opening is, Anything could be a question and the time starts now. So,I was having a chat with autocue, or the warm-up man, or the guy on the rig doing the lighting, any of that could be a question.HOW GOOD WOULD YOU BE AS A CONTESTANT ON THIS SHOW Im used to being on stage and having to remember someones name from  minutes ago so that I could do a call back to that guy on stage while Im doing the next bit. So, my memory is not bad.If youre a one-liner guy - and Im a one-liner guy - you need to be able to remember  jokes in a row every night, so you work that muscle a lot.WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE TAKING PART IN A CELEBRITY VERSION The dream team for this would be hosts of the other TV shows because I always think when youre the host of a TV show, youve got all the answers, and theres a bit of smugness that comes with that. So, get [Phillip] Schofield who does The Cube, [Jeremy] Clarkson does Who Wants To Be A Millionaire  now - get him. Get Anne Robinson.ITS BEEN A DIFFICULT COUPLE OF YEARS. HOW HAS THE COVID- PANDEMIC AFFECTED YOU PERSONALLY I guess every comedian was given an ultimatum by management you either do a podcast, or you write a book. I think I took the gentlemans choice I wrote a book [called Before  Laughter].And I was a full-time dad in the lockdown. I had a little baby two years ago. I never would have had that expansive time with my child, and I liked it an awful lot.TELL US MORE ABOUT THE BOOK...The book is basically everything I know about le. Its like half biography and half self-help. Theres a weird thing where looking back on your le, you could just believe it was luck. But you make your own luck you lean into what youre best at, you work hard at where you think you might have the most success.The idea of the book is that it would emulate a day with me. I go straight in on serious stuff with friends. So, this book feels like its a fairly good approximation of what itd be like to be my friend. Im very proud of it.HAS THE RISE OF CANCEL CULTURE CHANGED THE WAY YOU APPROACH LIVE COMEDY Cancel culture has always been a thing. I think I have a duty to my audience, that people have booked tickets to see an edgy comic tell edgy jokes, so Im going to do that. Im performing to an audience that has paid to be there, and we have a lot of fun. And its - somewhat ironically, I suppose - a very safe space, a comedy show. It feels like thats where transgressive comedy should live.YOU TURN  NEXT SEPTEMBER. DO YOU HAVE ANY WORRIES ABOUT THAT MILESTONE Ive had a reasonable amount of work done. They say you cant avoid death and taxes - Im doing my best to do both. I look terric. Look at that skin - iridescent, beautul!I think its about le stage, not age, and Ive got a young kid and Im running around with him. Ive never felt better.I Literally Just Told You starts, Channel , Thursday, pm."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-burrell-collection-purchases-first-sculpture-female-artist","story":"And at the time Sir William Burrell was collecting pieces it is unlikely he would have had the chance to buy one of her works.However, now in a series of firsts, the museum is the first public UK collection to acquire a work by sculptor Camille Claudel, its first acquisition in ten years and the first sculpture by a woman in The Collection.Read more: Call off Christmas parties Scots are urged amid fears over Omicron spreadThe museum, which houses one of the greatest global art collections ever amassed by one person, will reopen in March next year, following a major building upgrade and ambitious redisplay.Glasgow Le, the charity which operates The Burrell Collection, was able to purchase the sculpture by a key female artist, with support from the Burrell Trustees, National Fund for Acquisitions, Art Fund and Henry Moore Foundation.L’Implorante will initially be displayed as an exciting part of the inaugural exhibition in the newly designed Special Exhibition and Event space in the Burrell Collection. The free exhibition, due to open late summer , will explore the legacy of Sir William Burrell as a man and collector and his motivations to establish an internationally renowned museum for the people of Glasgow and beyond.Professor Frances Fowle, Senior Trustee, Sir William Burrell Trust, said: \"We are delighted to acquire this profoundly moving bronze by Camille Claudel for the Burrell Collection. This outstanding artist, although underrepresented in this country, was an important role model for women sculptors at the turn of the twentieth century. The sculpture will perfectly complement the museum’s important holding of works by Auguste Rodin, with whom Claudels career was so closely aligned.”Read more: Glasgows riverside: greatest untapped development opportunity in Western EuropeClaudel became a sculptor at a time when it was very dficult for women to do so. The École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where artists would usually attend to become a sculptor, did not accept women at the time. Undeterred, Claudel studied at the nearby Académie Colarossi.The blossoming artist was introduced to Rodin when she was -years-old. Two years later she began working in his studio. Soon, Claudel and Rodin became involved, and their lives, as well as their work, became inextricably linked.L’Implorante was created around the same time her relationship with Rodin was coming to an end, and he ed to his long-term partner, Rose Beuret. It shows a naked, young woman kneeling on rocky ground, reaching forward with both arms, asattempting to grasp something or holding something invisible. Her face has a child-like expression, her lips are parted asshe is about to say something, and her eyebrows are furrowed, expressing sadness.The kneeling figure was first modelled as part of a larger, three-figure group, L’Âge Mûrin -, which depicts a middle-aged man being led away from the youthful figure shown in L’Implorante. This group sculpture is commonly acknowledged to depict a regretful Rodin being stolen away from the young Claudel by an aged Beuret.The reproduction rights for L’Implorante were acquired from Claudel by the publicist and editor Eugène Blot around . He arranged for the sculpture to be cast in two sizes: cm and .cm. It is believed only five of the larger size were produced, plus around  of the smaller versions. Today four of these are held in the collections of the Musée Rodin in France, Albert-Andre Museum in France, Fondation Pierre Gianadda in Switzerland and the politan Museum of Art in New York.The Burrell Collection’s European bronze sculptures centre around  works by Rodin, a grouping second only in size to the VA in the UK including the well-known and much-loved sculpture The Thinker.When Sir William was actively collecting Claudel would not have been considered an important artist. Although not obvious at the time, he purchased a work with very close connections to Claudel. The Rodin sculpture Brother and Sister borrows directly from a pre-existing work by Camille Claudel. It is sometimes even regarded as a collaboration between the two artists. This will also be on show when the refurbished museum reopens in March .Councillor David McDonald, Chair of Glasgow Le, said: “We are elated to acquire this piece by Camille Claudel and indebted to the Burrell Trustees, National Fund for Acquisitions, Art Fund, Henry Moore Foundation for their support in helping us secure this internationally important sculpture for The Burrell Collection.“Glasgow Le is proud to actively collect work by women artists and announcing acquisitions is a source of huge excitement, especially when it is the first of its kind in the UK. Until now Glasgow did not have a sculpture by Claudel. This piece bolsters the collection and connects well with other works that will be on show, most notably by Rodin.“We are certain it will be a draw for visitors, and it demonstrates the Burrell is not a static collection, but one that embraces change and responds to the world around it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"omicron-uk-records-highest-daily-total-covid-cases-variant-spreads","story":"Official figures showed there had been , new cases recorded as of am on Wednesday.It is the highest figure announced since mass testing began in summer last year and surpasses the previous record of January  when , new cases were reported.Prime Minister Boris Johnson was set to hold a press conference from Downing Street later on Wednesday.READ MORE: Scotland is first UK nation to give booster vaccine dose to half of all adultsEarlier in the day, the mandatory use of coronavirus health certicates to demonstrate vaccination or a negative test for entry into large venues in England was introduced.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency\",\"description\": \"Omicron: Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency tells the Commons Transport Committee that Omicron is  \"probably the most signicant threat weve had since the start of the pandemic \"\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media DdpDTmga poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests DdpDTmga.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": Compulsory mask-wearing has also been extended and work-from-home guidance was reintroduced under the Government’s Plan B to tackle the pandemic this winter.But Mr Johnson suffered a major blow to his authority that raised questions over his ability to bring in further measures after  Tories rebelled to oppose the measures in a Commons vote.READ MORE: Swinney warns of more restrictions before ChristmasAnalysis suggested Omicron is now the dominant strain in London.The UK Health Security Agencysaid a further , cases of Omicron were recorded, bringing the total of confirmed cases in the UK to ,.But the agency earlier this week estimated that the true number of daily infections from the strain first detected in South Africa is around ,."},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

It would almost be better to have a regulation and a furlough scheme.#Sharing doubts over what number of people and what premises they attended actually constituted a #party#, he added: #Given that it#s best according to the authorities to avoid party situations then from a business point of view, we need support.#We need some clarity followed by some support.#The BID chairman#s comments came as leaders of all four UK nations are set to meet to discuss the rising levels of the new Omicron iant of COVID-. Earlier this afternoon, Ms Sturgeon warned that “dficult decisions” might have to be made in “days to come” amid this “surge”. Aware of the potential economic and social impact that further pandemic restrictions might have, she said that a lot would depend onfinancial aid could be agreed with the UK treasury.In the wake of this announcement and in the anticipation of further developments in the coming days, both Orkney Islands Counciland NHS Orkney have said they are prepared to respond to any new or righter restrictions which may be announced.Asked to respond to the First Minister#s announcement, an OIC spokeswoman said:  #The council is continually assessing its response to the pandemic and holds fortnightly incident management team meetings.#It was highlighted in this morning#s meeting that more announcements were likely to be coming from the First Minister.#Now that these announcements have been made this afternoon, they will be considered by officers, including our Safety  Resilience team and where necessary urgent matters will be escalated to the Incident Management Team or Senior Management Team as required, to ensure that that the council continues to support the response to the pandemic quickly and effectively.#The situation is of course fast moving and members of the public should expect further updates in due course —  but meantime we urge all to take very regular lateral flow device tests and to follow the guidance in respect to hand hygiene, face coverings and social distancing.#In a joint statement, NHS Orkney#s chief executive Michael Dickson and director of public health Louise Wilson explained that the guidance around parties has already been in force within their staff since November.They said: #The rapidly changing national picture is to be expected as we begin to understand the Omicron iant.#The guidance issued last night by Public Health Scotland regarding deferring Christmas parties was already in place here at NHS Orkney, we asked all our staff to show caution around Christmas events and to consider alternatives to reduce risk in early November.#Additionally, we have reminded all staff to work from home wherever possible and of course we are all continuing with our regular lateral flow tests and have all mitigations in place.#As the First Minister stated “our best form of defence is vaccinations”, we’d encourage anyone who is yet to be vaccinated to get in touch with ourselves, you can do this by calling   . We are well underway with our vaccination boosters and aim to have all booster vaccines administered by the middle of January with all appointment letters out before Christmas.#From tomorrowall household contacts of confirmed cases, Omicron or not, need to isolate for  days regardless of vaccination status or a negative PCR result. Non-household contacts can end isolation after receiving a negative PCR resultdouble vaccinated and have no symptoms.#These changes to isolation for household contacts of COVID- will have an impact across the community, and NHS Orkney has robust business continuity plans to help us deliver our key services.

It was fantastic how our fans were fighting with us and supporting us until the end. It is always a pleasure to have them with us and to give everything we can give them.“For Prowsey, it was a good moment to show his quality and then the belief was there to play how we wanted to play.“We had massive opportunities to score more and, yeah, second half I saw a game from both teams fighting for everything.”Despite a point in London, Southampton remain six games without a win and Hasenhuttl admitted they need to try to earn more free-kicks in central areas to help their captain exploit his talent even more.“It is such a good weapon we have to be more often in a situation where the opposition can foul us,” the Austrian stated.“I am very happy to have him in my squad and I am very happy he has this quality. We must give him more free-kicks in this position, I think.”Palace boss Patrick Vieira conceded watching Ward-Prowse find the net from a free-kick was “painful” but acknowledged the England midfielder possesses the ability to cause problems.He added: “It is painful but you have to recognise the quality of the player on set-pieces.“When it is a corner or right free-kick, or central free-kick, we knew that it is one of the strengths of their team. He took his chance really well and in that situation you just have to congratulate the player.”Vieira was less impressed with his team’s overall display and insisted they did not deserve to win.“When you look at the game overall, I am pleased to take a point because I think they played some really good football, they pressured us quite high and we didn’t manage to play through that pressure,” he said.“At the end they had a couple of chances and situations as well, so I think the point we took tonight, regarding the way we played, I don’t think we deserved more that.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1639578428893.jpg--covid_19___wed_15th_december_figures.jpg?1639578428000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211215newscovid 19 wed 15th december figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

That becomes a job, but there’s no compensation, and that person is not doing something to bring in revenue — it’s just a cost,” he argued.“That’s a shameful and embarrassing U-turn that reminds me of the grand prix on Sunday, although to arbitrarily change the rules at the last minute there did create something very exciting.”The Department of Health said: “The regulations were amended on Thursday afternoon, and the guidance was uploaded with revised language on Friday morning.“Hospitality sector representatives were briefed on the changes on Friday morning.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseSimon Hamilton being congratulated by former DUP leader Peter Robinson on his appointment as Stormont Finance Minister in  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueSimon Hamilton being congratulated by former DUP leader Peter Robinson on his appointment as Stormont Finance Minister in Traders are also worried about the prospect of further restrictions in the new year.Festive joy is in short supply, Mr Hamilton added.“Usually at this time of year you’re looking to a new year, to turn the page and be full of hope, and I just think a lot of businesses in those customer-facing sectors are coming into  and genuinely not knowing what they’re going to face, and that makes it dficult to plan... confidence is ebbing.“There is a great degree of worry out there. They’re worried, they’re weary and they’re wary about what the future might hold. They’ve been through a heck of a lot and it’s been a roller-coaster ride for them and many of them are finding it very, very dficult.”He says speculation about future restrictions from ministers and advisers can have an immediate impact on the mood in the city centre, leading to cancellations.Mr Hamilton doesn’t refer specically to Chief Medical Officer Michael McBride, who last month said restrictions in “certain environments and sectors” may be considered in the run-up to the festive season.He said: “There’s a lot of what I would consider to be damaging speculation around what may or may not come in.“The Executive must take decisions on the basis of what evidence it has, and it hasn’t been hugely helpful that there’s been a wide amount of speculation about what may be required now or in the future.“That has definitely impacted on trade and has definitely impacted on business confidence, and I don’t think sometimes there’s an appreciation of how weary business owners are and their staff whenever they hear that we may go through another period of restrictions.“It contrasts with the mood coming into the summer and early autumn when there were still dficulties, but there was a sense of optimism.“Unless there is a signicant amount of additional support coming from the Treasury, I don’t think the Executive has the capacity to properly compensate businesses.“This is a very careful balancing act for the Executive to take and I don’t think that they have the freedom to go much further in terms of what they are doing.“It would be grossly unfairthey were to go much furtherwithout compensating business for the inevitable damage to trading it would do.”He says the £m Shop Local scheme has been a welcome boost to the city centre and that the Chamber had championed the idea over a long period.But he acknowledges it has had some flaws, including its continued rollout over Christmas when much retail spending would have been taking place anyway.“I think that’s something we’re always looking for, things to be absolutely bang-on perfect,” he said.“But I think with the scale of the scheme it was always going to pose some dficulties in its implementation, and I do think those dficulties have in the grand scheme been quite small in the overall numbers.”The Chamber doesn’t yet know the level of cancellations of Christmas parties at Belfast venues over the last few weeks since the new Omicron iant was discovered and the prospects of new restrictions were raised.“Any conversation with hospitality, leisure or events tells me that it’s quite painful at the minute. At a time we thought we were moving to a better space, it’s unfortunately very reminiscent of some of the other periods, like this time last year or other times in the pandemic, where we’ve had very dficult conversations with people who are wondering what the heck they’re going to do,” he added.Askedhe regrets being away from the challenges of running a Stormont department during Covid-, he jokes: “Do you watch the news  I do, I read your newspaper and others, and I don’t miss it and I’m glad I am where I am.“I don’t look at anybody who is doing some of the jobs that I used to do and have anything other than a huge degree of admiration for them. I was in dferent challenging posts in dferent periods and there’s always perpetual crisis in Stormont of one kind or another.“It is incredibly dficult to govern in this place and I can only imagine how much more dficult it is to do it at the moment. I look at them and wish them well. I wish them luck or whatever, but I am only glad I am not one of them.”He says ato politics, perhaps even for a dferent party, isn’t on the cards.“It sounds like I’m not closing the door or ruling anything out, but one thing that le has taught me, and I’m old enough now to start making mental notes about lessons, you never rule anything out as you don’t know where le is going to go,” he said.“But that is a phase of my le that I feel is done. To say I thoroughly enjoyed it suggests that I enjoyed every single second, but I really did enjoy that period. It was an immense privilege to serve in those three departments — but I don’t see that as something I would want to do again.”Most ReadBallymena man McClintock admits murder of Jason Lee Martin at party after doctor retracts evidenceDUP’s Jim Wells taking packed lunch to Stormont after canteen ‘ban’ under Covid rulesLoyalist graffiti claiming ‘war is needed’ appears in NewtownardsF bosses would blush at Stormont Covid rule change, blasts HamiltonI just want you to stop, BBC Northern Ireland journalist Aileen Moynagh tells teenage troll in courtTop VideosPlayWho exactly does the met police work for ma#am - Our citizens, or Boris JohnsonPlayVideo: Funeral for -year-old Aaron Webb killed in Glenavy crash PlayColum Eastwood says #Prime Ministers actions have eroded public confidence# Latest CoronavirusCrumbs of comfort in short supply as price of a Christmas dinner rises to £Mapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageDUP’s Jim Wells taking packed lunch to Stormont after canteen ‘ban’ under Covid rulesNI Assembly backs mandatory Covid certication laws – How did your MLA vote Avoid last year’s chaos and act now, union tells Education Minister McIlveen over Omicron fearsLatestSir Ringo Starr features in new music video for George Harrison’s My Sweet LordTom KellyOpinionGovernment’s shameful amnesty can’t wipe out the pastSaints boss chipper after the quality of his skipper brought the team to leArsenal move into top four at West Ham’s expenseJurgen Klopp won’t go shopping for replacements during African Nations Cup,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Tolga AkmenAmy CochraneTwitterEmailDecember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Department of Finance has revealed that two-thirds of the £m in ‘new’ Covid- funding announced by the Government on Wednesday had already been earmarked to help fund business rates in Northern Ireland.A leading economist has also revealed that,implemented, the full £m would only cover approximately six weeks of a potential furlough scheme.The “extra money” for Northern Ireland was a consequence of additional Treasury funding announced for services in England and was to be used to progress the vaccine rollout and strengthen the wider Covid- response. It will be available to spend almost immediately, and it will be up to the Executive on where to allocate the funding.A spokesperson for the Department of Finance, however, told this newspaper that £m of the £m due to be given to Northern Ireland was already expected to cover rates relief.“This funding announcement includes £m the Executive had already anticipated it would receive before the end of the financial year as a result of Westminster funding for business rates,” they said.Chief Economist at Grant Thornton NI, Andrew Webb, said that, while welcome, £m is a “relatively small amount in the context of what Covid has already cost NI.”Mr Webb said that ious packages of supports have cost in excess of £bn, according to an Audit Office report, with the furlough scheme costing £.bn alone. He added that with the Omicron iant and new advice to work from home and socialise less, “the economy is at risk of slipping backwards”.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “There may yet be a furlough type scheme for hardest hit sectors, but it is unlikely that the Executive’s coffers can stretch to much in the way of furlough support,” he said.“For context, the additional £m that the Executive has just received would probably cover about six weeks of a furlough scheme just for the hospitality sector.“I would suggest the £m is geared towards getting as many boosters in arms as quickly as possible,” Mr Webb added.“If the situation worsens, and the economy does slide backwards, Rishi Sunak may have to turn the Treasury taps on rapidly.”In total, £m is being made available from the UK reserve, with Scotland receiving £m and Wales £m.Related topicsDepartment of Finance The Executive OfficeMore On \" class\"-as:\"Department of Finance Holiday at home voucher scheme plan is scrappedSome NI health workers could receive bonus payment as Swann bids to avert catastrophic strike action PremiumStormont ministers attend events despite their work from home message PremiumDUP Spad Emma Little-Pengelly paid £k when role ended after Arlene Foster exit PremiumSam McBrideOpinionRates law being rammed through Assembly will have huge implicationsMost ReadBallymena man McClintock admits murder of Jason Lee Martin at party after doctor retracts evidenceDUP’s Jim Wells taking packed lunch to Stormont after canteen ‘ban’ under Covid rulesLoyalist graffiti claiming ‘war is needed’ appears in NewtownardsF bosses would blush at Stormont Covid rule change, blasts HamiltonI just want you to stop, BBC Northern Ireland journalist Aileen Moynagh tells teenage troll in courtTop VideosPlayWho exactly does the met police work for ma#am - Our citizens, or Boris JohnsonPlayVideo: Funeral for -year-old Aaron Webb killed in Glenavy crash PlayColum Eastwood says #Prime Ministers actions have eroded public confidence# Latest Northern IrelandStaff crisis warning as it’s revealed  nurses quit in just five monthsNear neighbours, yet Lisburn man lives longer than one in BelfastElderly man dies following Co Londonderry road crashAbuse survivors commissioner ‘saddened’ as Stormont evidence session cut shortCrumbs of comfort in short supply as price of a Christmas dinner rises to £LatestMikel Arteta salutes attitude of Arsenal players after victory over West HamStaff crisis warning as it’s revealed  nurses quit in just five monthsSir Ringo Starr features in new music video for George Harrison’s My Sweet LordTom KellyOpinionGovernment’s shameful amnesty can’t wipe out the pastSaints boss chipper after the quality of his skipper brought the team to le,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In these straitened times, you no longer think just about how it will look and taste, but how much it will cost.This year, you can blame the turkey, Brussels sprouts and traditional puddings for driving up the cost of a Christmas dinner.New data shows the cost of a Yuletide feed has gone the way of so many other things in this Covid-ridden, post-Brexit world and risen by % this year compared to last.Analysts at the market research company Kantar found that the total cost of  key items for a family of four had climbed by .%, with an average dinner now hitting £., which is up around p from .It comes as the rising cost of some of the most expensive ingredients in the festive feast offsets a fall in the price of basic vegetables including potatoes, carrots and parsnips.Industry figures revealed that overall grocery inflation rose to .% in the four weeks to November , its highest level since June last year.A % year-on-year hike in the price of frozen turkey, linked to processors battling with higher labour and feed costs, means the Christmas dinner favourite is now retailing at £..Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Up by % are puddings , sproutsand caullower .

They may be prepared to splurge now because they anticipate having to rein in their spending in the new year.“We’ll only get a true understanding of what happened when we analyse the data in January.”The inflation figure was driven by price rises in savoury snacks, crisps and cat food.A separate report by Kantar, which analyses the grocery market, recently revealed local shoppers were spending less money on alcohol and food in supermarkets as they continue to enjoy the post-lockdown pleasures of dining out.The three biggest supermarkets have all suffered a fall in local sales, although challenger Lidl bucked the trend with another surge in sales.Kantar said supermarket spending in the  weeks to the end of November was down by .% on the same period in , a time of intermittent lockdowns that shut hospitality.The change in behaviour had the starkest impact on retailers such as Centra, Mace and Spar.Kantar said spending in the category was down .% on .

Le expectancy for men decreased from  years in  to . years in , and female le expectancy decreased by . years from . years in  to  years in .A spokesperson for DoH said: “Given that the pandemic has no doubt exacerbated existing inequalities the Department, with the Public Health Agency, has also worked to deliver a range of actions to address the impact of Covid-, and other health conditions and behaviours, on the most deprived communities across Northern Ireland.”Related topicsSDLPThe Executive OfficeDepartment of HealthMore On SDLP PremiumViewpointOpinionThe party is over, it’s time to discard the Prime Minister PremiumSix arrests and dozens of other NI penalties on day of Tory bash PremiumAndrew MaddenOpinionThe weekly political spin: From ‘Vets For Hunting’ to a housing letter for Santa PremiumExplainer: How immigration laws being passed by British government will impact the Irish borderFinding missing patients costs police £.m a yearMost ReadBallymena man McClintock admits murder of Jason Lee Martin at party after doctor retracts evidenceLoyalist graffiti claiming ‘war is needed’ appears in NewtownardsDUP’s Jim Wells taking packed lunch to Stormont after canteen ‘ban’ under Covid rulesF bosses would blush at Stormont Covid rule change, blasts HamiltonI just want you to stop, BBC Northern Ireland journalist Aileen Moynagh tells teenage troll in courtTop VideosPlayWho exactly does the met police work for ma#am - Our citizens, or Boris JohnsonPlayColum Eastwood says #Prime Ministers actions have eroded public confidence# PlayVideo: Funeral for -year-old Aaron Webb killed in Glenavy crash Latest Northern IrelandElderly man dies following Co Londonderry road crashAbuse survivors commissioner ‘saddened’ as Stormont evidence session cut shortCrumbs of comfort in short supply as price of a Christmas dinner rises to £Claire Hanna MP received two death threats over Northern Ireland ProtocolReview of redress process for historical institutional abuse survivors welcomedLatest‘Get boosted now’ logo compared to Hula HoopsArsenal into top four as Gabriel Martinelli and Emile Smith Rowe sink HammersBrighton’s winless run continues as Romain Saiss goal earns victory for WolvesCrystal Palace and Southampton share four goals at Selhurst ParkElderly man dies following Co Londonderry road crash,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Specsavers is encouraging avid readers to have regular eye tests so they can continue to indulge their hobby. Presbyopia is the gradual loss of our eyes’ ability to focus close up as the lens becomes less flexible. A natural part of ageing, it usually becomes noticeable around the age of . The condition is common and typically isn’t a cause for concern. But some struggle to adapt, and find they need to hold their book at arm’sto read the page or direct a light on it to see the words more clearly. For most people, the answer is a simple eye test which will identythey need reading glasses, multi-focal glasses or contact lenses to make words clearer – and le easier. Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Clares barbers scooped the top prize for Northern Ireland Barber of the Year Derry NewsDerry barbers wins NI Barber of the Year overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Bookings will open December  as the large centre opens due to growing concerns over the Omricon iant. You can still receive vaccinations from your GP and local pharmacists. People will be encouraged to use the booking system as the number of walk-ins that can be accommodated will be limited. Visit the Western Trustwebsite as of December  for updates on booking info:westerntrust.hscni.net western-trust-covid--information-updates covid--vaccination-programme  Alternatively you can book at a local participating chemist or pharmacy for first, second or booster vaccines. The Western Trust has issued an appeal to staff to help in the escalated operation as vaccinators. The Trust stated in a post: “The Chief Medical Officers have agreed that the COVID- Booster Programme should be accelerated to help deal with the Omicron Variant. We are therefore once again asking for your help and are calling all those staff who previously worked in our vaccination programme back to assist over the next three weeks. This includes Vaccinators, Administrators and Support Services staff. Our Chief Executive and Corporate Management Team have agreed that staff will be released back to support the vaccine programme, unless there are exceptional circumstances. We appreciate how important leave is and we will try to protect any leave already booked, but would appreciate any flexibility that staff may be able to give. The announcement comes as SDLP Councillor, Brian Tierney, encouraged people across Derry to get their Covid- booster vaccine. Councillor Tierney said: “I would encourage everyone who is eligible to get their Covid- booster vaccine as soon as possible to protect themselves and those around them. With the renewed threat the Omicron iant is posing to our society, we need to do everything we can to increase our defences to the virus. I would also urge anyone yet to receive their first and second doses to take this opportunity to get vaccinated. “There will be a number of places throughout the Western Trust area where people can get their booster vaccine, including the Foyle Arena and Omagh Leisure Complex from Wednesday. Booster vaccinations can also be provided by your GP and local community pharmacy. People are being encouraged to book their appointment from Wednesday, but limited walk-ins will also be available. “Following the current Covid- guidelines, including getting vaccinated, using Covid certication, practising social distancing and washing our hands is the most effective way of keeping each other safe and preventing the need for further restrictions. Nobody wants to see another lockdown, particularly so close to Christmas, and we all need to pull together, get vaccinated and help each other through this dficult period.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Clares barbers scooped the top prize for Northern Ireland Barber of the Year Derry NewsDerry barbers wins NI Barber of the Year overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Paacutedraig Delargy said: “We need to see major investment to improve rails services and connections in the North West of this island. “Linking up all rail services on an all-island basis presents huge opportunities to grow the economy and create jobs, particularly along the Western Corridor linking Derry to Sligo and Galway and delivering a faster train service to the capital in Dublin. “This would help unlock Derry’s potential, promote regional equality and connect us to the rest of this island with major benefits for workers and commuters. “Alongside this, delivering first-class public transport and investing in our rail lines can help tackle the climate emergency and reduce carbon emissions. That should be the focus of transport ministers, North and South. I would encourage people to take part in the consultation. The deadline to take part in this consultation is Friday, January .

Ryan, who moved to Strabane from Derry with his parents when he was three weeks old, always liked drawing as a child butwouldntsay that it was his main hobby, “Im sure the others that were in my in class at school would say that I was decent at art but I would not have stood out as someone with a particular talent,” he said. “Drawing was my thing. Painting was something I completely avoided - I had no confidence in it. Nowadays,itsbecome the only medium I work in. I love it. “I think Ideveloped my painting through the little bits and pieces I was doing with my students from day to day. The first proper piece I did was the portrait of Seamus Heaney. That was around six years ago. Since then, painting has become a real passion for me.” Ryan’s we, Roisin,has always pushed him to share his work on social media. Over the first lockdown, Ryan finally gave in. He said: “I was so nervous putting the first piece up but I was completely overwhelmed by the response I received. “Most people who knew me wouldn’t have known that I painted in my spare time, soI think people were surprised to start with. “People started asking me to do prints of the portraits of Jack Charlton, John Hume and Samuel Beckett, and so I did. “Then others would ask me to do paintings for them and that has grown into what I do today.” Ryan’s love for portraiture began when, ata young age, he saw Van Gogh’s ‘Postman, JosephRoulin.’ The -year-olds love of portraits snowballed from then on and now it is what he enjoys painting the most, with a particular love for painting people of interest from the island. “In my work, I am normally trying to promote a shared view of our community – portraying people we should all be able to celebrate regardless of background,” he said. “When painting someone’s portrait I need to feel that the image captures something of that persons personality as I see it. “Recently, I have been commissioned to do a few landscapes which I have also enjoyed but the portraits seem to come more naturally to me. “I would say producing art has only really become a career goal in the last - months. I never would have thought that anyone would have been interested in having my work on their wall and I amreally gratefulto everyone who has invested in it. “I do think it will always be something I will do on the side though. I enjoy working with the students in school and I think I’d find it dficult to leave that behind.” Ryan’s most recent commission - to paint the late John Hume for a customer in Spain - was a special moment for him, “I was over the moon to have been asked to work on this specic piece.  “Itsthe second timeIvepainted him. I came across this image a while back and I was eager to paint it as soon as I saw it. “I was delighted when my client chose this as the image she wanted. John Hume was a true great. What he did for the people of Derry is immeasurable and he is loved across our community. “I recently passed a few prints of this piece to some of the Hume family.

Ryan, who moved to Strabane from Derry with his parents when he was three weeks old, always liked drawing as a child butwouldntsay that it was his main hobby, “Im sure the others that were in my in class at school would say that I was decent at art but I would not have stood out as someone with a particular talent,” he said. “Drawing was my thing. Painting was something I completely avoided - I had no confidence in it. Nowadays,itsbecome the only medium I work in. I love it. “I think Ideveloped my painting through the little bits and pieces I was doing with my students from day to day. The first proper piece I did was the portrait of Seamus Heaney. That was around six years ago. Since then, painting has become a real passion for me.” Ryan’s we, Roisin,has always pushed him to share his work on social media. Over the first lockdown, Ryan finally gave in. He said: “I was so nervous putting the first piece up but I was completely overwhelmed by the response I received. “Most people who knew me wouldn’t have known that I painted in my spare time, soI think people were surprised to start with. “People started asking me to do prints of the portraits of Jack Charlton, John Hume and Samuel Beckett, and so I did. “Then others would ask me to do paintings for them and that has grown into what I do today.” Ryan’s love for portraiture began when, ata young age, he saw Van Gogh’s ‘Postman, JosephRoulin.’ The -year-olds love of portraits snowballed from then on and now it is what he enjoys painting the most, with a particular love for painting people of interest from the island. “In my work, I am normally trying to promote a shared view of our community – portraying people we should all be able to celebrate regardless of background,” he said. “When painting someone’s portrait I need to feel that the image captures something of that persons personality as I see it. “Recently, I have been commissioned to do a few landscapes which I have also enjoyed but the portraits seem to come more naturally to me. “I would say producing art has only really become a career goal in the last - months. I never would have thought that anyone would have been interested in having my work on their wall and I amreally gratefulto everyone who has invested in it. “I do think it will always be something I will do on the side though. I enjoy working with the students in school and I think I’d find it dficult to leave that behind.” Ryan’s most recent commission - to paint the late John Hume for a customer in Spain - was a special moment for him, “I was over the moon to have been asked to work on this specic piece.  “Itsthe second timeIvepainted him. I came across this image a while back and I was eager to paint it as soon as I saw it. “I was delighted when my client chose this as the image she wanted. John Hume was a true great. What he did for the people of Derry is immeasurable and he is loved across our community. “I recently passed a few prints of this piece to some of the Hume family. It isvery rewardingto know that theyhave gotmy paintings of him in their homes and that makes it all very worthwhile to me.” Ryan is currently loving the balance between producing his art and working as an art teacher.Theex StColumb’s student has a young family and is extremely busy between work and home. He added: “At the minute I am absolutely loving it. I am reluctant to take on too much as I would never want my art to become a burden.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Clares barbers scooped the top prize for Northern Ireland Barber of the Year Derry NewsDerry barbers wins NI Barber of the Year overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The SDLP published their energy costs action plan last week and Mr Durkan called for a payment of up to pound, to be extended to all households in receipt of Universal Credit. The payment would help families top up their gas cards and fill their oil tanks so that they would be able to heat their homes over the winter without worrying about how to pay for it. Mr Durkan said: “Given the steep rise in energy bills over the last few months there are families across the North struggling to heat their homes this winter. “In the absence of any action from the Joint First Ministers or Minister Hargey to mitigate the situation the SDLP has produced a number of proposals in our energy costs action plan to try and help people through this very dficult period. “While energy bills are increasing by hundreds of pounds a year, Universal Credit claimants, who are already struggling to get by, have seen their payments cruelly cut by pound a week by the Tory government and waved through by Sinn Feacutein. “These people were barely able to cover their bills before the recent price hikes and I cannot see how they will able to meet these massive costs. “In an attempt to help the people who really need it I’m calling for the winter fuel payment, a modest payment of up to pound, to be extended to all households in receipt of Universal Credit. “This money will allow families to top up their gas cards and fill their oil tanks to get them through this winter, then we can focus on tackling the long-term issues around fuel poverty. “I’m also calling on the Department for Communities to work with the Department for Health to explore how families with children with disabilities can be supported to cope with rising energy costs. “It’s disgraceful that we are already in the grip of winter and no plan has been forthcoming to help low income families deal with these mounting issues. “I will continue lobbying Minister Hargey and doing all I can to secure immediate support for the people who need it most.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Clares barbers scooped the top prize for Northern Ireland Barber of the Year Derry NewsDerry barbers wins NI Barber of the Year overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The Mayor was promoting a shop local drive for ChristmasReporter: Matthew Leslie Dec Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Mayor Graham Warke has urged Derrys festive shoppers to shop local this Christmas during his whistle-stop tour of businesses and shops throughout the city. googletag.cmd.push Last week the Mayor visited a number of retail outlets and shops to find out how local traders are finding the Christmas shopping season. As part of his tour, the Mayor visited businesses in the heart of the city centre, including the Craft Village and in the Waterside. He also visited businesses in the outskirts of town at Maydown and in Eglinton and later in the week spent time with traders in Strabane. This past  months have been an extremely challenging time for local businesses, and Derry City  Strabane District Council is keen to inspire confidence among the public by encouraging them to shop local.

Mayor Warke said: “Local businesses have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic. “Now during the busiest shopping period of the year, it’s vitally important that we support these local traders as much as possible. “These independently owned businesses are what makes our City and District unique and I was delighted to see the products and wares they have on offer, particularly for Christmas gts. I would encourage the public, as much as possible, to spend local this year.” Business Development Officer with Derry City and Strabane District Council, Tara Nicholas, reiterated the Mayor’s comments adding: “Mayor Warke has heard first-hand from traders about the dficulties they have been facing throughout the pandemic. “They have also shared with the us the sense of ‘community spirit and support’ they have been receiving from their customers. “We have a great opportunity to help our home-grown, independent businesses here flourish. “Deciding to shop local really makes a huge dference to our local traders and we shouldn’t underestimate how impactful even our small spends can be. “Our independent stores and shops employ so many local staff and by supporting them, we are making a great choice in terms of supporting ourselves.” Find out more about the campaign at:shoplocalderrystrabane   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Clares barbers scooped the top prize for Northern Ireland Barber of the Year Derry NewsDerry barbers wins NI Barber of the Year overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Cllr Harkin said the city of Derry should be proud of the workers for standing firm and stated that industrial action could easily have been avoided by the two employers. And Cllr Harkin expressed his hopes that both employers can learn from this dispute and move on and not to victimise employees who are UNITE trade union members for the action they were forced to take. He said: “We commend Derry dockers for staying strong and winning their demands following strike action. They should be proud of what they achieved. Everyone in the city should be proud of the dockers victory. “By staying united and braving freezing weather on the picket line, UNITE members at Burke Shipping Services and Foyle Port made gains on pay parity and a wage increase. “This was a strike that should never have been necessary. The demands made by workers were very modest but employer intransigence gave them no option but to take action. “The attempt to portray workers negatively by employers raises serious questions about public accountability when Council support is sought to become a Free Port. “It also raises questions about Derry City and Strabane Councillors having paid positions as part of the Foyle Port Commission. “People Before Profit activists were on the picket line everyday of the strike and we successfully put forward a motion winning the Council to take a clear-cut position in support of the strike and trade union demands. “We will be demanding the Council make clear there should be no victimisation of workers and the trade union following the end of the dispute. “Dockers and other workers have been told throughout the pandemic that they play a critical role as key, frontline and essential workers. “Trade unions are now demanding this is translated into improved wages and conditions for workers across all sectors. “That employers and the Stormont Executive arent automatically backing these demands points up the problem of an economy catering to elites where the gap between the least well-off and those at the top has skyrocketed. “Workers across Derry, across the North and across Ireland should take confidence and example from the resilience of Foyle Port dockers. “This is what will need to happenwe are to ensure health workers, Council workers, Education support workers and all others begin to be treated with dignity, respect and more economic equality. “No one should be told they should wait for better days - this is the time to use solidarity and action to challenge poverty pay.” UNITE General Secretary, Sharon Graham, added: “This is a tremendous win for our members. “Having endured freezing cold and driving rain on long days on picket lines, the workers stood ready to escalate their strike action but their determination led to both employers making offers which met their demands in full. “This is a good news story for workers everywhere in Northern Ireland and shows that there is a power in our union. “It confirms yet again that when our members fight in unity for their jobs, pay and conditions they can win.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Clares barbers scooped the top prize for Northern Ireland Barber of the Year Derry NewsDerry barbers wins NI Barber of the Year overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Clares barbers scooped the top prize for Northern Ireland Barber of the Year Derry NewsDerry barbers wins NI Barber of the Year overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Photo by Piaras Oacute Miacutedheach SportsfileReporter: Chris McNulty Dec   addthis, Georgie Kelly has informed Bohemians that he will be making his exit from the League of Ireland. googletag.cmd.push Kelly, who scored  goals in all competition in , is courting plenty of interest from abroad. The Tooban native was named as the PFAI Player of the Year and will make a move out of the League of Ireland for . Clubs in England and Scotland are chasing Kelly’s signature, but there has been contact from other counties that have piqued his interest. Derry City were keen on Kelly, whose time in the League of Ireland began in the Candystripes before he moved to UCD. but the payer will not be staying on home soil. Central to Kelly’s decision regarding his next destination will be the ability to complete a Masters in Renewable Energy and Environmental Finance, which he is undertaking with the UCD Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School. He recently told Donegal Live: “I don’t really know what’ll happen next year. It’ll depend on options, being honest. “I wouldn’t jump at the chance to play in League Two or in Scotland, just to get that move.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true _.jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About gallery from Walshs  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Clares barbers scooped the top prize for Northern Ireland Barber of the Year Derry NewsDerry barbers wins NI Barber of the Year overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

I am contacted about cleansing issues on a daily basis and while working with council staff a solution is found, butrobust processes and procedures were in place, this should be routinely completed and no major issues should arise.Cllr Sharvin says he is also keen to see greater attention on cleaning play parks, explaining that currently there is no formal process to do so and operates on adhoc basis.ldquoGiven the increase of use play parks during Covid and the councilrsquos objective to increase healthy living in our communities, itrsquos vitality important that we clean and maintain our play parks on a regular basis. Council officials have agreed to replace surface safety tiles at our play parks and I hope this programme will continue to be rolled out, he said.Cllr Sharvin said that following the recent workshop, council officers are to compile a report which will be discussed by councillors..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"District’s battering from Storm Barra  ","story":"DOWN District was pummelled by Storm Barra yesterday with gale force winds and driving rain coinciding with a spring high tide to wreak havoc.Thunder and lightning was added into the heady weather mix with the storm conditions bringing down a number of trees along the coastline.

pop royalty and real-le royalty, George Lowdenrsquos guitars are known to be the best in the world.The Prince of Wales recently made known his knowledge of and fascination with Georgersquos guitars and Ed Sheeran reportedly likes to keep one handy in nearly every room of his house.With Niall Horan of One Direction and Dubliner singer songwriter Dermot Kennedy becoming the latest owners of the bespoke guitars, Georgersquos company, Lowden Guitars, has just announced its latest collaboration with Sheeran.To celebrate the release of his most recent album, Sheeran has teamed up with George, who founded the firm in , to design and create a signature guitar worthy of music royalty.The Sheeran by Lowden Equals Edition guitar will also be available to the public to purchase, with a limited edition run of , available through Lowdenrsquos global dealer network.Itrsquos the second joint project with Sheeran, following on from their range of more affordable guitars.The latest achievement comes in the wake of George recently meeting the Prince of Wales at a Windsor Castle reception to mark Lowden Guitars winning the  Queenrsquos Awards for Enterprise.He also launched a new range of limited edition guitars to mark his th birthday over the summer which features specications chosen by George.Itrsquos all a far cry from when the renowned luthier first began to hand-make guitars for his own use.He could never have known that his determination to make the best guitar would see his name travel around the world and be spoken of by royalty.ldquoTherersquos quite a lot of things that have happened that I never could have imagined. When I started out, I had no formal training in the manufacture of guitars, explained George.ldquoIn a way, that gave me the confidence to take some risks, innovate and produce an instrument that has a completely unique voicing.He found the Prince of Wales to be very interested in the guitarsrsquo manufacture and may have even suggested a new development.ldquoWe had a great chat and he asked quite a lot of questions about the wood, all kinds and how we found it, said George.ldquoHe was also very interested in dieback ash, asking aboutit would be a very good way to use the trees as a lot have perished due to this disease.ldquoIt wouldnrsquot be the best toned wood you could find but Irsquove been thinking more about that since and wondering whether we could use it for guitar necks or not so we might do a little experiment to seeit works.From creating coveted instruments for top Irish and UK guitarists in the know, Lowden Guitars have become an international sales success mdash hence the Queenrsquos Award.George explained: ldquoThe company is far bigger than I ever envisaged. In some ways itrsquos good but I never tried to expand the company and get the kind of growth we have enjoyed. It just kind of happened over the years as organic growth which has been great.His guitars tend to sell by word of mouth from musician to musician and the actual experience of playing a Lowden and relishing its distinct tones at first hand.ldquoWherever in the world where we sell, we are still quite a niche, upper end company so the guitars are at the highest price level in all of the countries, said George.ldquoItrsquos a natural process where people see the guitars for the first time. They go into a shop and then over a period of a few years the reputation builds within that country. Our presence also grows and then we move into more specialist guitar shops, so it all takes time.ldquoI remember as a teenager I was mad keen to get a Gibson  which I saw in Matchettrsquos shop window in Belfast all those years ago and I couldnrsquot afford it.ldquoIf something is really good, and the young player comes in and plays it but canrsquot afford it, it goes into his or her mind and later on they find a way to afford it.George says the Covid pandemic has not impact on sales, although it has had other consequences.George said: ldquoIt didnrsquot impact on us for sales as our order book remained very firm but it was more to do with making the guitars as we had to completely re-organise the factory for better social distancing which was very expensive.ldquoWe had to close down the factory for a while in order to do that and more with people having to isolate it proved challenging..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Magpies fly high in Breffni Park  ","story":"DOWN kingpins Kilcoo qualied for an Ulster semi-final after a good performance at Kingspan Breffni Park on Saturday evening, defeating Cavan-based Ramor United by  points.The Magpies, reigning Ulster champions, will meet Glen of Derry in the last four in what will be a massive clash in two weeks time.It was tit-for-tat early on but the home side got a massive confidence boost in the fth minute via a well taken Sean McEvoy goal, their most impressive performer on the night.Kilcoorsquos response was emphatic though, firstly Ceilum Doherty stuck over a nice point and then that man Jerome Johnston done what he does best and fired to the net to put his side into a lead they would never relinquish.Further scores from Ryan McEvoy, Shealan Johnston and Doherty again sent them in four up at the water-break.The second period of the first half turned out to be poor affair with both sides missing good scoring chances.

Four dedicated spaces for electrical vehicles are also included.Itrsquos understood that in addition to the  jobs in the new Lidl store, a further  will be created across the other proposed retail units, with  jobs created during construction and development.Council planners are recommending to members that the application be approved with  conditions including its full construction within a five-year period.In papers submitted ahead of Mondayrsquos planning meeting, planners said they were recommending approval as the proposed retail use is considered to comply with the local development plan.They say that when the buildings are constructed, they will not adversely impact on the character of the area or have a detrimental impact on the amenity of existing residents in properties adjoining the site.ldquoAppropriate provision is made to meet the needs of cyclists and adequate facilities are made for shower and changing facilities as required for such a major employment-generating development, the papers point out.A spokesperson for Lidl said the poundm store would reflect the retailerrsquos concept design, boasting a sales floor, a shopping environment withspacious, wide aisles, long tills, restrooms and baby-changing facilities, as well as a bakery offering and staff facilities.ldquoOur ambitious plans to complement the site with additional retail and leisure units represent an investment of more than pound million into the area and the support of more than  jobs, he said.ldquoWersquore proud to be part of the centrersquos signicant regeneration and bring a new future of growth to the locality whilst honouring the sitersquos historical connections to the community.The spokesman added: ldquoWe hope to receive planning permission for the site and look forward to opening the brand new, state-of-the-art Lidl store early next year, bringing shoppers even more choice of quality products at unbeatable value.Carryduff shopping centre was a prime retail destination for many years, but since the closure of its flagship Supervalu store in , it struggled to attract an anchor tenant that would drive its growth.The formal planning application by Lidl follows an extensive local consultation of the plans undertaken in February which was positively received by local representatives and the wider community.Lidl acquired the . acre Carryduff shopping centre site in August last year as part of the retailerrsquos plans to expand its store presence across the region to more than  stores by the end of the decade..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Newcastle harbour development plans  ","story":"THE redevelopment of the former generator house at Newcastle harbour has the potential to act as a catalyst to secure additional investment.Thatrsquos the assertion of Mournes councillor Willie Clarke whose comment came after Monday eveningrsquos annual meeting of the Newcastle Harbour Heritage Association.He congratulated the grouprsquos chairman Campbell Miller and the committee members on the ldquofantastic positive contribution they have made in improving the harbour over the past year.Cllr Clarke said the two main items discussed at the annual meeting included the refurbishment of the former generator house as a community hub and the provision of a new boarding pontoon that would allow disabled people to board vessels, something which he said is long overdue.The business case for the new floating pontoon recently passed through Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee.Cllr Clarke explained the vision for the generator house includes the provision of showers, toilets, and changing facilities for water-based recreation, alongside a meeting room for the community and harbour users.He said the business case was submitted to the local authority and approved through the so-called community transfer process.ldquoIt is essential that this building is refurbished for the local community which will be a catalyst in the development of the harbour, suggested Cllr Clarke.ldquoIn addition, it offers an excellent opportunity for the local council and the harbour community to develop a partnership to create a community hub for the area. I will be facilitating meetings with council officials to progress this vital community asset as quickly as possible.Cllr Clarke said there was no doubt that with an ldquoambitious and focused vision for the future, the harbour area could become a unique attraction, meeting the needs of not just the local community, but also become an exciting destination for those who visit Newcastle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Red High hurlers through to final  ","story":"THE first half of this Danske Bank Mageean Cup semi-final was brilliant to watchthere were any neutrals around.If you were a supporter of either St Patrickrsquos or St Louisrsquo, it was nail-biting, edge-of-the-seat drama played at a blistering pace with top class scoring at each end.That half finished - to - in favour of the Ballymena side.For the Red High management of Darren Swail, Sean Paul Gibson and Danny Toner, the entertainment factor had to be sacriced to get the result they needed.Bringing Oisin Coulter back as extra cover in defence curtailed the damage that Ballymenarsquos two Loughgiel inside forwards had done in the opening half, but it also meant that the Red Highrsquos attack would struggle to retain ball to keep the scoreboard running.Jack McCloskey had scored - in the first half and Roacutenaacuten McCollam -. McCollam fired over another point in the th minute and pointed a free at the very end while trying to it in on the Downpatrick area to poach a late goal.McCloskey didnrsquot score in the second half and being out of general play resulted in his normally reliable free-taking also taking a hit.At the other end the outnumbered Downpatrick forwards had to survive on scraps as well but they could always rely on their free-takers.Goalkeeper Pearse Smyth landed two points from inside his own half, while Tom McGrattan converted three frees and landed a point from play as well.McGrattan was the star of the game and he capped a brilliant inidual performance with two late plays that effectively took his team into the final.With the game in the balance at - each in the rd minute, McGrattan jinked his way along the sideline under the stand to win himself a free.It was an acute angle, but the Portaferry clubman arrowed the sliotar between the uprights.Then less than a minute later he played a beautul cross-field pass into the path of mid-fielder Finn Turpin, who stepped inside the defender and hit the roof of the net from  metres out.St Patrickrsquos were through to their first ever Danske Bank Mageean Cup final where they will play St Patrickrsquos Maghera at the Dub Arena on Friday week, December .But back again to that breath-taking first half.After five minutes, the teams had each scored three points. By the tenth minute, Jack McCloskey had cut through the Red High cover and shot to the net off the base of the right hand post.Within three minutes Downpatrick were a point up. McGrattan went around the left side of the Ballymena defence at full pace to rle to the roof of the net for one of the best goals that you will see at any level.Aodhan McGarry responded by pointing from a side-line and the water-break broke the action at - each.McGarry started the second quarter scoring with a fine point but a run of three successive scores from Finn Turpin, McGrattan and Oisin Coulter edged the Red High ahead again.However, three frees from Jack McCloskey and a point from Ronan McCollam put Ballymena in the lead by - to - at half-time.By the second water break Downpatrick were - to - ahead, mainly through frees and St Louisrsquo were now looking for scores from distance.The next  minutes went scoreless. In hindsight Ballymena snatched at a couple of scoring chances that might have put pressure on the eventual winners who pumped a lot of ball in high on the north Antrim defence with no .Eventually sub Tom McFerran brought the teams level and McCollam from the left wing gave St Louisrsquo the lead. The gauntlet had been thrown down for the Red High.Oisin Coulter landed a much-needed Downpatrick point in reply and they held firm until Tom McGrattan delivered the match-winning scores.It is scant consolation for Ballymena that they played their part in a fine display of schoolsrsquo hurling, but a number of players stood out including Daire McMullan, Connor Dickson and Dara Martin in defence and McCollam and McCloskey in attack until tempered by Downpatrickrsquos packed back line.Defence was ultimately the winning of the game, but they would not have got across the line without Turpin, Oisin Coulter and especially the mercurial Tom McGrattan.As a hurling disciple of the great Bro Charles in the s, I was a proud man leaving the Dub on Friday evening.For the generations of hurlers who climbed to the top of the hill on Saul Street each morning over the past  or  years, winning a Mageean was just not on the radar.This team is only  minutes from achieving what for us was the impossible.St Patrickrsquos: P Smyth - frees, J Ruddy, R OrsquoNeill, D Coulter, S Mageean, D Mallon, C Lenaghan, T Connolly -, F Turpin -, M Dorrian -, A Connolly, T McGrattan - , O Coulter -, R McGrath, S McCarthy.Subs: F MacManus for A Connolly , LMcCabe for S McCarthy , F Casey for R McGrath ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Road officials set to carry out survey at Ballynahinch school  ","story":"PLANS by roads officials to carry out a survey on the main road outside Ballynahinch Primary School have been welcomed by Strangford MLA Peter Weir.The work will be carried out to assess the potential for a new pedestrian crossing and while pleased that the survey is to take place, Mr Weir is disappointed that there are no current plans to also introduce a temporary mph speed limit at the Dromore Road as part of a province-wide Department for Infrastructure initiative.Mr Weir mdash who has met with school principal Mr Michael Moore mdash said the safety of children who have to cross the busy road was of paramount importance and a real issue of concern for parents and residents.The former Education Minister said he was ldquodisappointed that the school had not been included in the Roads Departmentrsquos part-time mph speed limit scheme.ldquoI believe that the Department needs to give a clear commitment that Ballynahinch Primary School will be included in the next roll-out of the scheme, said Mr Weir.ldquoThe Dromore Road is busy and is also a bus route. Given that the primary school is located off this road, many motorists may not even realise they are passing a school as they drive along.Mr Weir said while he welcomed the assessment into the potential for a dedicated pedestrian crossing, he will continue to press for road safety improvements outside the school.In their response, roads officials say there is high demand on the Department for Infrastructure to introduce traffic calming measures at ious locations on the road network and that each request is considered carefully.They point out that schemes for such measures are prioritised, taking into account collision history, vehicle speeds, traffic volumes, road geometry and the character of the specic location to ensure that limited available finance is targeted to those sites in most need.Engineers point out that the Dromore Road is within the mph speed limit and, unfortunately, would not be suitable for traffic calming measures in the form of speed bumps.They say there are already existing mph gateway signs in place and also red textured surfacing on the Dromore Road which is also served by existing street lighting.ldquoAt present, for a mph speed limit, no additional traffic calming measures can be provided at this time, they said in a letter, confirming that an assessment for the provision of a pedestrian crossing in the vicinity of the primary school will take place..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Santas come riding into town  ","story":"THE th annual Saintfield Christmas Charity Ride took place on Saturday.It was freezing cold with occasional rain showers, but it certainly didnt dampen the spirits of the Santas taking part or the crowds of men, women and children who lined Main Street to greet them.The children were overwhelmed with excitement when they saw Santa getting out of his carriage at the Christmas tree and he certainly had surprises for them in his sack.Hugo Duncan, Boxcar Brian and Gerard Dornan provided top drawer entertainment.

Jimmyrsquos  is scheduled to take place on Sunday, March , and it is anticipated that interest will be high especially given that the Seeley Cup sold out well in advance.The Joe Seeley offers a flat and fast course starting on the Ormeau Embankment in Belfast with two and a bit laps through the Ormeau Park.For those watching or racing it was a sharp cold day, but miraculously the heavy rain and high winds that preceded the .pm start died down just in time to let the runners have a fair crack at a good performance.At the pointy end there were small clusters of runners who made a break early on in the first lap and then a lead group of five formed as they headed out for the second lap. The huddle of five then broke apart in the last K as they hurtled towards the finish line in break neck speed.Overall winner Owen Everardonly edged for glory in the last two strides as right to the mat it was not clear who would breach the tape first.His time of . was two seconds ahead of Matthew Neill , who was one second ahead of third-placed Eskander Turki . The top  competitors were all sub  minutes for K, which is fast by any means.East Down ACrsquos Neil McCartan, who prefers shorter distances and would choose track over road running, finished in a commendable .. This is not a personal best time, but given that this is his first serious attempt at a K in three years he will be more than satisfied. This got him well inside the top  in th place.Neil Curran reaped the rewards of his consistent cross-country racing, converting the stamina gained in that discipline to a strong road performance. He was chuffed to take  seconds off his previous best time and at . is well poised to run a sub  minute K in the near future.He said that he ran conservatively off the start as he was fearful of overcooking it and as a result ended up running solo for a large part of the distance. This is a hard way to race, but gives him plenty to work with in his next event.Junior titleMackenzie Murray was taking on his first ever K and well warned to pace it carefully, he ran a superb race in .. Many runners set sub  minutes for K as a good base goal, but he smashed that and some.He was even more delighted to discover that he was the quickest junior athlete on the day by well over a minute. As mentioned this race stood as the NI  Ulster Championship, so he gains that title as well as a Seeley Cup age group win.A great achievement.It was actually a hat trick as he also snatched bragging rights in the Murray family as his dad Dee and mum Janine were also racing on the day.Dee was next home for EDAC in a very respectable .. Dee has been troubled by niggles and was not even surehe was going to start let alone finish, so being able to take part was more important than the result.Seamus Savage who was the next EDAC finisher is training hard to regain fitness and based on his current form he went in not expecting too much.While he enjoyed the race, he found it tough in the latter half. He can take his time of . as a bench mark as he aims to work on his speed in the coming months.The ladiesThe overall standard of the female field compared well with the menrsquos with the top lady coming home in ..

She is enjoying being part of a club and the support that this garners.She reacted well to the shouts of encouragement and finished sub  minutes, a bit ahead of Janine Murray who recorded . despite a hamstring niggle.While the Seeley Cup is seen as a fast race it is also inclusive with many targeting the distance rather than a specic time. Sam Anderson was glad of the cheers of club mates as she battled to the finish in one hour and seven minutes. Another race ticked off by this consistent attender. Good work by all three.Cross-countryThe Robinson brothers, Oliver and Alex, ended off their  cross-country season with a trip to the Uneven Age Group All Irelands Cross Country in Gowran, Kilkenny, on Sunday.The sun shone all day but the temperature stayed low with the ground remaining icy in parts. Alex had gained his Ulster U- team place by coming sixth at the Ulster  NI race in Donegal a few weeks previously, so he had set his expectations high.His race was ,m around a very twisty course through long grass, all of which made it more technical than previous races.The start of any cross-country race is hectic with lots of jostling and this was no exception.Alex was pulled back when the gun went off and then had to contend with some fallers so he never really got into his stride.He was disappointed to place th out of a field of  runners, but deserves huge credit for his commitment over the last few months.Alexrsquos older brother, Oliver, was running for the Down team in the U- race.

In my opinion, such an appointment is crucial and could benefit the town and the business community a great deal.ldquoThe night time economy is one area that needs to be improved not only in Downpatrick but where, but rapid progress this in the current Covid climate may not be possible.ldquoHowever, there is no reason why ideas to regenerate our night time economy cannot be discussed now to lay plans for the future, he continued.Cllr Curran said every high street is dferent, with many people keen to see them become vibrant shopping hubs at the heart of local communities, explaining that the work of the Stormont task force could not be more timely.He added: ldquoAnything that can be done to increase footfall in our town centres in the future will be more than welcome.The call for evidence document is available at https:www.executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk consultations call-evidence-high-street-task-force, while responses to the call for evidence can be made to highstreet@communities-ni.gov.uk..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13300618.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I’m looking for opportunities to boost trade in key areas such as digital, services and agriculture, as well as discussing ways our world-class professionals, such as engineers or lawyers, can offer their services more easily in the US.Starting in Calornia, my journey takes in Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee and Oklahoma, with a pitstop in Belfast’s twin city, Nashville, to take in some of Tennessee’s famous country music.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Penny Mordaunt with Lori Odom, vie-president of International Business for the Nashville Area Chamber of CommerceI’m championing Northern Ireland’s top-quality goods and services and making the case for why it’s a great destination for investors looking for the next big opportunity.Northern Ireland’s trade and investment relationship with the US is already one of the strongest in the UK, with big American companies like Citi, Spirit AeroSystems and Allstate continuing to grow their presence in the area.It’s a fact that Northern Ireland has seen the largest percentage increase in employment in US-owned UK businesses outside London and the South East, rising three-fold between  and .It’s also the number one international investment location for US cybersecurity development projects.Today, there are more than  US-owned businesses in Northern Ireland employing some , people.Cognizant, a digital IT services company headquartered in New Jersey, recently announced plans to create another , jobs over the next four years, with new delivery centres in Leeds and Northern Ireland.Digital transformation consulting firm, PA Consulting is also expanding its operations in the region with a new digital centre in Belfast.US enthusiasm for Northern Ireland isn’t limited to investment, though.Last year, America snapped up goods worth £ million, or nearly % of NI’s total exports. Among the firms to have capitalised is Ulster Carpets, which has offices in America and sees the US market as pivotal to its international strategy. Of course, it’s not just goods that Northern Ireland is successfully selling to the US.Thanks to the global reach of shows like HBO’s smash hit Game of Thrones, Northern Ireland’s production landscape has enjoyed a huge boost. Paper Owl Films, based in Hollywood, says the show raised the profile of the entire Northern Ireland creative industries sector for film and TV.SixteenSouth is further testament to this the Belfast-based BAFTA-winning animation studio with over  international accolades has attracted global stars to voice characters in its shows, including Tennessee’s very own Dolly Parton.So, whilst transatlantic trade remains strong, there is always more we can do. That’s why we recently launched our ‘Made in the UK, Sold to the World’ plan to help businesses across Northern Ireland unleash their export potential and start selling their world-class products to the US and beyond.No matter what stage of their export journey they are at, businesses can access government support via the Export Support Service, a one-stop shop for exporting advice.As part of this, we’ve also launched a new UK Tradeshow Programme to help businesses across all parts of the UK attend more events and tradeshows to promote their products around the world.With the expansion of DIT’s Export Academy to SMEs in Northern Ireland and the launch of Trade and Investment Northern Ireland, there’s never been a better time for businesses in Northern Ireland to start exporting. In fact, research shows that companies that export their goods are % more productive than those that don’t. The International Trade Secretary was in Northern Ireland last month, hosting the Board of Trade in Derry Londonderry and encouraging businesses right across the region to take advantage of the support on offer. As we continue to break down more trade barriers, cut red tape and make it easier for UK companies to trade abroad, I can’t wait to see more businesses capitalising on the enormous opportunities that the US has to offer.– Penny Mordaunt is UK Minister for Trade PolicyFor more opinion on everything from Gerry Adams to the national anthem, visit this link: www.newsletter news opinion——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Only the six counties of the newly formed Northern Ireland were to be permitted to remain within the United Kingdom. Their devolved Parliament, which had been opened by King George V the previous June , was given the power to vote them out of the all-Ireland settlement, based on dominion status, which the Treaty embodied.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The document that was locked away in Downing Street bore the signatures of four members of the British delegation who had negotiated it. They formed a column headed by Lloyd George himself the others, drawn from his Liberal  Unionist coalition cabinet, were Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, Lord Birkenhead , and Winston Churchill.Another column listed the signatures of three of their Irish counterparts, headed by Arthur Grfith, the founder of Sinn Fein in , and followed by the charismatic Michael Collins, the chief organiser of the IRA’s terrorist campaign against Britain, waged from  until July  when a truce was agreed between the two sides. The third Irish signatory, Robert Barton, a Unionist landowner turned Republican and an intimate friend of Collins, was the Sinn Fein delegation’s economic adviser. Never before had British and Irish representatives put their names to a formal agreement of this kind as complete equals. After the signing, which took place at . am, the two sides shook hands for the first time. Trust had replaced the deep suspicion with which they had first regarded each other. Irish leaders, who a few months earlier had been denounced as rebels and murderers, had come to enjoy the respect of the British delegation. Michael Collins had undergone an astonishing transformation from terrorist leader to statesman, gaining the admiration of two prominent members of the British team, Churchill and Birkenhead.Final agreement on the terms of the treaty had been reached in two intense negotiating sessions in the Cabinet Room at No , which ended two months of wrangling. The first session, which lasted over five hours, began at pm on December . Lloyd George employed all his formidable political skills to secure a breakthrough in all but one of the key areas that had hitherto defied resolution.The Irish gained the full fiscal and financial autonomy they craved. The British got what they wanted on defence: the use “in time of war or of strained relations with a foreign power [of] such harbour and other facilities as the British government may require”, combined with the permanent retention of what came to be known as the Treaty Ports , major strategic assets which Neville Chamberlainwas to abandon in a further Anglo-Irish Treaty in  to Churchill’s fury. Since the start of negotiations in October, the words of an oath of allegiance which Irish elected representatives would in future be required to swear had been through endless drafts. It was at last settled with a suitably convoluted rigmarole to spare the Irish republican conscience as much strain as possible: “I will be faithful to His Majesty King George V, his Heirs and Successors by law, in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland and Great Britain, and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.” This was the first time on which the customary reference to Empire was dropped from an official document.There remained just one make-or-break issue: Northern Ireland, with its devolved powers over local matters entrusted to it by Westminster earlier in . Sinn Fein were determined to get it into their independent state. Lloyd George was happy to give them all the help he could. In November, he had piled pressure on Sir James Craig, the Northern Ireland prime minister. In letters and conversations he tried, with all his accustomed craftiness, to get Craig to accept that he had a patriotic duty to remove the last barrier to peace in Ireland by joining a sovereign all-Ireland Parliament in place of Westminster, while retaining all the devolved powers that Westminster had provided.The Unionist members of the British delegation did not demur. Not for the last time, Ulster Unionists found that they could not rely on their English Unionist allies in high places . Austen Chamberlain said that separate arrangements for six of the nine Ulster counties were “illogical and indefensible”. He thought “the greatest moral pressure” should be put on Northern Ireland to bring it into a settlement that was “vital to the Empire”. His party chairman, Sir George Younger , believed “Ulster should take some risks and forget some of the past arguments against unity in Ireland”.These Unionist calls for compromisewere made against the background of a sustained press campaign, led by The Times, criticising Ulster Unionists for their intransigence. “Ulster blocks the way to peace” was the newspapers’ regular refrain. Craig described it as “ a press campaign against Ulster without parallel in the history of Great Britain.”But the Northern Ireland premier was unmoved. He told Lloyd George that a single parliament for Ireland was “precisely what Ulster has for many years resisted by all the means at her disposal”.Lloyd George tried another tack in November, concentrating his cunning this time on the leader of the Irish delegation, Arthur Grfith. Here he had much greater success than in his attempts to manoeuvre Craig into an all-Ireland parliament. At a private meeting with Grfith on November , he got the leader of the Irish delegation to give a personal written pledge that,Northern Ireland refused to accept an all-Ireland settlement, it would remain under the British Parliament, “but in this case, it would be necessary to revise the boundary of Northern Ireland. This might be done by a Boundary Commission ... to make the boundary conform as closely as possible to the wishes of the people.” What went unrecorded in the paper was the clear impression given by Lloyd George that Northern Ireland would lose so much territory that it could not survive as a separate entity and a united independent Ireland would as a result come into existence.During the course of the long afternoon session in Downing Street on December , Lloyd George reminded Grfith of what they had agreed.Proof was needed. A frantic search was made of the prime minister’s wardrobe, and “eventually an insignicant pocket cast up an envelope and a piece of paper.” On the strength of this written undertaking to establish a Boundary Commission whichwould undermine Northern Ireland, the leader of the Irish delegation agreed to sign the Treaty himself, but said that he could not commit his colleagues.At this, Lloyd George assumed a magnicently melodramatic air. He had told Craig in Belfast to expect news of the outcome of the discussions in Downing Street the following day. That could of course have been done by telephone, but Lloyd George now conjured up an elaborate plan to send the news in writing to Belfast in an attempt to force a decision out of the other two Irish delegates.“Here are the alternative letters which I have prepared, one enclosing Articles of Agreement reached by His Majesty’s Government and yourselves, and the other saying that the Sinn Fein representatives refuse to come within the Empire. If I send this letter it is war, and war within three days. Which letter am I to send  Whichever letter you choose travels by special train to Holyhead, and by destroyer to Belfast. The train is waiting with steam up at Euston ... to reach Sir James in time we must know your answer by ten p.m tonight. You can have until then, but no longer, to decide whether you will give peace or war to your country.”With these impassioned words ringing in their ears, the Irish delegates ed to their Knightsbridge hotel for anguished discussions amongst themselves, but promised to be back in Downing Street by the pm deadline. In fact, it was nearly .pm when they ed.Nothing more was heard about the special train waiting at Euston. Grfith announced calmly, “Prime Minister, the Delegation is willing to sign the agreements, but there are a few points of drafting which perhaps it would be convenientI mentioned at once.” The most important concerned the Boundary Commission redrafting increasedthe likelihood that Northern Ireland would collapse. At Iam on December , an agreed text was handed to the Downing Street typists.In England, reaction to the treaty was ecstatic. The Times led the way: “These are fitting peace terms to mark the close of an age of discontent and distrust, and the beginning of a new era of happiness and mutual understanding.” In Ireland, discontent intensied and took a new form: the long quarrel with Britain was replaced by distrust and ision within Sinn Fein, which led to a bitter civil war the following year. In Northern Ireland, IRA terrorism increased, generating sectarian stre in  parts of Belfast came to resemble the battlefields of the First World War. The Boundary Commission recommended only minor changes, and its report was shelved. Englishmen looked away. “The country”, said Austen Chamberlain, “wants peace and is tired of Ireland and Ulster.” English politicians hoped they would never have to think seriously about Irish affairs again. For nearly  years they had their wish — which meant that that they were fatally handicapped by ignorance when the Ulster crisis of  erupted.l BIBLIOGRAPHY—D.G.Boyce, Englishmen and Irish Troubles: British Public Opinion and the Making of Irish Policy -and “ How to Settle the Irish Question: Lloyd George and Ireland -” in A.J.P.

Photo: Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.Sir Michael McBride urged all adults in Northern Ireland to get a booster vaccine as he and chief scientic adviser Professor Ian Young said Omicron is likely to become the dominant strain in Northern Ireland before the new year.Professor Young said that Omicron is expected to peak in mid-January and daily case numbers are likely to be higher than at any other time during the pandemic.It comes as the number of confirmed cases of Omicron in Northern Ireland has reached , according to the Public Health Agency.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

We know that it is signicantly more transmissible, probably around two and a half times more transmissible than the Delta form of the virus.“If we look at what is happening where in the UK and internationally, we see that once Omicron becomes established, it spreads remarkably quickly.“The doubling time for cases is around two days in England and Scotland, and it is inevitable that we are going to see the same thing in Northern Ireland.“As a result of that, we will see increasing numbers of the Omicron virus and they are likely to increase very rapidly.“It is probably going to become the dominant form of the virus, certainly before the end of this year and possibly earlier than that.”He added: “There is an expectation in UK-terms of very large numbers potentially of Omicron cases, numbers much higher than we have seen at any previous stage of the epidemic.“And that would also be the case in Northern Ireland.“The key question is the steps to which those very large numbers would translate through into hospital admissions.“There is a sense that very large numbers of cases, while disruptive to society and dficult for iniduals can be managed.“It is the number of people who will require admission to hospital which will be the critical factor.“If Omicron were to be similar to Delta, then it would be signicantly worse than that, possibly even several times worse, without further measures.”It comes as deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said that Northern Ireland cannot be held to ransom over Covid- financial support and be left waiting for decisions to be taken in England.Ms O’Neill said: “Of course we are looking at our own resources but I am asking the Treasury to stand up the furlough scheme again today, that needs to be done so,we need to reach for it, it’s there and available to us.”DUP First Minister Paul Givan said engagement with the Treasury was ongoing to establish what additional financial support was on offer.He said the Executive may also have to ert some more of its own resources to tackle Omicron through the next in-year reallocation exercise, which is due in January.Meanwhile, four further patients who had previously tested positive for Covid- have died in Northern Ireland.Another , cases of the virus were also reported by the Department of Health on Wednesday.On Wednesday morning there were  Covid-positive patients in hospital, of whom  were in intensive care.More from this reporter:Click here: Covid keyboard theorists should knock off the Nazi comparisons says MLA Click here: Kne-edge Irish unity survey from Tory peer stands in contrast to much more pro-Union pollsClick here: Bill to bar abortions of disabled foetuses up to birth voted down at Stormont——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

With the spread of Omicron has come new restrictions in England – one Wednesday, Boris Johnson announced the UK government would switch to its winter Plan B.Because health is devolved, that move has no direct impact on Wales – and in any case the new rules for England, such as Covid Passes for some events and venues, and the recommendation to work from home, have already been in place in Wales for months.But Ms Morgan will be meeting with first minister Mark Drakeford and other Welsh ministers today for the latest three-week review of the Covid rules. The results of that meeting, and any rule changes in Wales, will likely be confirmed this evening or on Friday.MORE ON CORONAVIRUS:In the meantime, the service in Welsh NHS-run Covid testing laboratories will be increased to seven days a week in a bid to track the spread of Omicron.The health minister called the emergence of the new strain \"a sombre reminder that the pandemic is not yet over\".\"There is concern that the Omicron iant may be spread much faster than other iants,\" Ms Morgan added. \"It’s important we try to delay the spread of Omicron in Wales, and to do so we need to rapidly identy cases..remove\"Throughout the pandemic testing has played a crucial role and we want to swtly identy Omicron cases here in Wales.\"This alongside other measures already in place will help us once again to keep Wales safe.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communitySpeaking on BBC Radio Wales this morning, Dr Frank Atherton said: “It is the worst time of year to be considering this, but I think we just have to look at population mixing.“It is almost inevitable that we may have to consider what measures to reduce population mixing are needed at this point in time but that is for ministers to discuss and I will be providing advice on that.”Dr Atherton spoke after he and the other three chief medical officers in the UK agreed to raise the UK Covid alert level yesterday to level four. This does not change the current restrictions in place in Wales, which currently remains at alert level zero.Dr Atherton also said that the initial peak of the omicron iant was predicted to be around January or February - but rates are rising quicker than expected.“When I first heard about omicron, I thought it would be a problem in January and February. With these transmission rates we are far more likely to see a problem running into the Christmas period and then into early January. So that is why we felt the need to raise the alert level,” he said.He also highlighted things that people in Wales can do to help minimise the spread.He said: “It is unpalatable at this time of year to say this, but we need to think about contacts we are having because we know that this virus loves to transmit from person to person and we cannot afford to have large gatherings at this time of year because it will bring community transmission that we are fearful of.”He also highlighted the importance of the boosters and having the booster when people are called for. “We are seeing quite signicant numbers of people have been contacting the NHS to say they have got an appointment for their booster but are going to delay it and asking for another appointment,” he said..removeMORE NEWS:“That implies people aren’t prioritising it and that is natural when it is Christmas time and people are thinking about other things.\"What we are now saying is you cannot think about anything more important than getting your booster because we know that the vaccine effectiveness is reduced a bit but the protection with booster shots against serious harm is still about  per cent and so the best thing, we can do for ourselves, and our loved ones is to get your booster shots when you are eligible.”Dr Atherton explained that, although the Welsh Government had set a target of offering everyone in Wales aged  and over a booster jab by the end of January, they are working through to bring this forward. He said how there has been work over the weekend to increase this rollout and this could include walk-in clinics, extra vaccination clinics and more volunteers to allow for more vaccines to be administered quicker.He also advised that the rollout will prioritise the elderly and vulnerable first and that everyone over  should have received their invitation for a booster shot. Those who have not should contact their health board. Everyone  over the age of  should wait until they are contacted.He also confirmed that those who are housebound will be able to receive their boosters and that GPs have been given more money to prioritise these. Anyone over  who has not received and invite should contact the relevant health board.Dr Atherton said that, although there are only  cases of the omicron iant in Wales, he expects community transmission is on the rise as seen across the UK and in other nations. It was confirmed this morning by health minister Eluned Morgan that one person in Wales was in hospital with the omicron iant.Dr Atherton said: “It is inevitable as community transmission rises, two weeks later there will be a rise in people needing hospital treatment and needing oxygen and ITU treatment. And two weeks later sadly, a rise in deaths.”He added that decisions around introducing more restrictions were up to the ministers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAndrew RT Davies, Senedd Member for South Wales Central, is supporting the campaign to save Bute Cottage Nursery School.The Vale of Glamorgan Council plans to merge the nursery with Evenlode Primary School – which leads campaigners to believe that the site, which has extensive outdoor areas with many teaching and learning provisions including a chicken coop, summer house, sand pit, pirate ship and another outdoor house, could close for good.Campaigners – more than , have signed a petition against the merger – also feel that the nursery will lose its name, identity and independent governance. Currently with the independent governance, children lead their own learning with support from their experienced nursery teachers.The plans would change the lowest age of pupils at Evenlode from four years old to three, and would add  part-time nursery places to the primary school. Bute Cottage would be discontinued, and staff and pupils would transfer to the primary school by September next year.Laura Windeatt, who launched the petition, said: “This proposal is the start of a slippery slope, starting with Bute Cottage losing its name and identity and ending with its closure and the loss of an environment we should all be determined to preserve.“The loss of Bute Cottage would be signicant to the Vale’s community and felt deeply by the generations of ‘Buties’ across the years, not to mention the future generations who would miss out on such an enriching and inspiring start to their education.“On paper, a single site may at first glance seem practical, especially at such a good, reputable school as Evenlode, but those who know Bute Cottage know that losing it would be a travesty. Bute Cottage is a gem in the heart of the Vale of Glamorgan — one that we should vehemently protect.”MORE NEWS:Mr Davies said: “I do not want to see the merging of Bute Cottage and Evenlode but,that were to happen, it would be even more devastating to see the Bute Lane site close.“It’s important that the Vale Council puts this issue to bed and categorically rules out closing the Bute Lane site of the Bute Cottage Nursery. The facilities at Bute Lane are superb, and perfectly facilitate the pupil-led learning that is implemented at Bute Cottage.“The staff and governors at Bute Cottage have developed a unique identity and learning experience for their pupils.“Their pupil-led learning philosophy is something that should be protected and not lost in a merger with another school with dferent values.The Vale of Glamorgan Council is currently working on going through the consultation responses ready for the full cabinet to make a decision.https:www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-bute-cottage-nursery-schoolGet involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He said tidal energy in the Severn estuary could provide as much as seven per cent of the total energy needed across the UK.He said: “The UK government has so far refused to support a scheme due to a perceived requirement for high levels of public investment and concerns over the environmental impact on designated areas in the Severn estuary.“However, the changing landscape of the climate emergency, energy insecurity, rising costs, and rapid technological improvements indicate that many of these policy, cost and environmental barriers may no longer be as signicant. We want to find out what could be done to harness this incredible energy resource.”In October the group revealed it was setting up a new commission to explore building a barrage across the estuary, as well as exploring other options for tidal energy. A barrage had previously been looked at in depth about a decade ago but ultimately dropped as it was seen as too expensive and harmful to the environment.Regional groups such as the Western Gateway, and the more established Northern Powerhouse, are considered key in attracting huge levels of investment needed for major infrastructure projects, like improving the railways, as well as foreign direct investment..removeSpending per person on infrastructure construction is about  per cent higher in the Northern Powerhouse than across the Western Gateway region, Cllr Thomas said, without including the benefits from HS.He added: “HS represents a signicant improvement in connectivity across other parts of the country, putting the Western Gateway at risk of becoming worse off. South Wales and the west of England have not enjoyed the levels of rail enhancement investment experienced where in the UK over the past  years.“This underinvestment has led to relatively less attractive services, attracting fewer passengers, and leading to higher subsidies compared to the rest of the UK.“HS will put Cardf and south Wales at a signicant disadvantage. While the UK economy is predicted to receive a £ billion benefit from HS, south Wales’s GDP will lose an estimated £ million per year. There are similar negative impacts for the southwest of England, with Bristol losing £ million per year, and Gloucester, Bath and northeast Somerset another £ million annually.”To counter this, the Western Gateway is seeking investment for a range of railway upgrades. These include upgrading the South Wales Mainline and Great Western Mainline, running from Swansea through Cardf, Bristol and eventually leading to Heathrow and London. This could mean faster speeds, new stations, and full electrication.Other rail upgrades include improved links between Cardf Central and Bristol Temple Meads, with express and local commuter services, potentially with four services an hour between the two stations.

It was fantastic how our fans were fighting with us and supporting us until the end. It is always a pleasure to have them with us and to give everything we can give them.“For Prowsey, it was a good moment to show his quality and then the belief was there to play how we wanted to play.“We had massive opportunities to score more and, yeah, second half I saw a game from both teams fighting for everything.”Despite a point in London, Southampton remain six games without a win and Hasenhuttl admitted they need to try to earn more free-kicks in central areas to help their captain exploit his talent even more.“It is such a good weapon we have to be more often in a situation where the opposition can foul us,” the Austrian stated.“I am very happy to have him in my squad and I am very happy he has this quality.

The consultation with key stakeholders will run for a period of  weeks.”The issue first arose inFebruary  when the council received a request from Abbeyville Residents’ Association for five Irish language street signs which was turned down after councillors voted in favour of a policy retaining street signs in English only proposed by Glengormley DUP councillor Alderman Phillip Brett and seconded by Glengormley Ulster Unionist councillor Ald Mark Cisgrove.Ald Brett stressed the importance of the council having a policy on the issue so thatthere were future requests, these could be dealt with “smoothly”.Ald Cosgrove said that given the facts and figures presented to members over the number of Irish language speakers in the borough, the request would be “preposterous” and street signs would look like a “dog’s dinner”.According to the  census,.% of residents in Antrim and Newtownabbey had some knowledge of Irish. In , it was reported that  people in Antrim and Newtownabbey spoke Irish as a main language.However, in September , the council was forced to do a u-turn after being challenged in the High Court by a resident who sought a judicial review over a “deeply held concern that the policy adopted by the local authority was unlawful”. Read hereThe borough councilinsisted that its policy was “not a ban in any way on the Irish language” and a new, “more detailed policy would be drafted for the council to consider”.Commenting on last week’s decision, SDLP group leader Councillor Roisin Lynch said: “I was disappointed that councillors decided to support this deeply restrictive policy. It is a shameless and deliberate attempt to slow down and stymy efforts for dual language signage.“There can be little doubt that this onerous policy is designed to obstruct efforts to progress the visibility of Gaeilge in our local communities. I am particularly disappointed that Alliance Party councillors backed a policy designed to restrict the growth of the language.“It is of vital importance that the Irish language is given the visibility it deserves and that anyone who wishes to see bilingual signage in their area has access to a fair and transparent process. This is a slap in the face to those in our communities, including myself, who know that we need to break down barriers to the visibility of the the Irish language, not create new ones.”Antrim and Newtownabbey Mayor Councillor Billy Webb commented: “This is not an Irish language policy. This is a multi-lingual policy. We are a erse community.“The policy is going out to consultation. We were looking for one third of residents of a street to instigate an application and then  per cent plus one in the actual vote. That is a normal and true democratic process.
