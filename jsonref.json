On average, such dresses and other products are discarded by consumers after five weeks.Missguided, an online rival to Boohoo, which also sources products from Leicester, took the low pricing even further this week by promoting a £1 bikini, which proved so popular with customers that the website crashed.But behind the price tag there is an environmental and social cost not contained on the label of such products. “The hidden price tag is the cost people in the supply chain and the environment itself pays,” said Sass Brown, a lecturer at the Manchester Fashion Institute. “The price is just too good to be true.”\u0027Fast fashion\u0027 is a phrase coined to describe inexpensive clothing produced rapidly by mass-market retailers in response to the latest trends.

UK consumers sent 300,000 tonnes of textiles to be burned or dumped in landfill in 2018.Without rapid reform, the fashion industry - of which fast fashion is the dominant player – could be responsible for\u0026nbspa quarter of the Earth’s carbon budget by 2050.Socially, the booming fast fashion industry is often built on low wages paid to women working in factories abroad but also increasingly in the UK, in cities such as Manchester, Birmingham, London and Leicester. There is no evidence that factories in the Boohoo and Missguided supply chains pay illegal wages. However, some garment workers in Leicester are paid an average of £3 an hour – way under the national minimum wage – MPs heard in evidence.MPs found that the Modern Slavery Act was not robust enough to stop wage exploitation at UK clothing factories. There was a lack of inspection or enforcement, allowing factories – none of which are unionised – to get away with paying illegal wages.In the UK, we buy more clothes per person than any other country in Europe – five times what we bought in the 1980s, which creates 1.3m tonnes of waste each year, some 350,000 tonnes of which is dumped in landfill or incinerated.Yet despite the overwhelming evidence gathered by the environmental audit committee (EAC), ministers this week rejected every recommendation for tackling abuses across the fashion industry, including a ban on incinerating or landfilling stock that can be recycled and a 1p charge on each garment to raise £35m a year for better clothing collection and sorting, a move supported by many in the industry.Theresa May said in parliament the government already had measures in place, including a multimillion-pound grant scheme to help boost the recycling of textiles and plastic packaging.But the response of the government was met with anger by many within the industry, where ethical fashion firms come up against others who produce at lower costs on the back of exploitative wage structures and environmentally damaging production models.Phoebe English, the English fashion designer, said: “It is extremely alarming to see that our government has failed to grasp the true extent of the consequences of the fashion industry carrying on the way it is.“It is a vastly damaging industry that has been spiralling unchecked for far too long. The Earth and the people on it are exploited and damaged at every single step of the chain, and this culminates with unimaginable mountains of unused excess stock or badly made broken waste clothing with nowhere to go other than landfill or incineration.”English said it was up to the industry to pull together to regulate itself and urgently put an end to bad practice.But others are less sure that voluntary measures will tackle what they say is a systemic power imbalance between brands and manufacturers, which leads to worker exploitation, or address the enormous environmental footprint of their trade.“The knowledge is out there. We know the scale of those impacts and we know what some of the solutions are,” said Dr Mark Sumner, a lecturer in retail and fashion at the University of Leeds. “What we need is the government to come up with some clear policy, whether it’s around legislation, or voluntary initiatives to incentivise a change of behaviour by brands.”With growing scrutiny of their business model, brands are beginning to promote an ethical face. This week Boohoo promoted its recycled brand For the Future, using fabrics made from synthetic waste saved from landfill.“They are moving in the right direction, but this is a micro-percentage of their output,” said Brown. While Boohoo is promoting its “green” credentials, repeated attempts by the trade union Usdaw to talk to workers at its delivery centre in the UK about union rights are being rebuffed by the company. Mary Creagh, the chair of the EAC, said: “If brands want to be ethical, they should start by allowing a trade union into their premises rather than barring the door.”Prof Nikolaus Hammer, associate professor in work and employment at Leicester University, carried out research into the fashion industry in Leicester, where he found employees working in appalling conditions, with no employment contracts, earning on average £3 an hour. It was the brands, he said, who held all the power over manufacturers to keep cutting their prices. “They will go to the manufacturer and say that person down the road can do it for 1p less, and they get the job,” he said.He doubted that any greening measures by brands could make them ethical and sustainable while still fulfilling the model of fast fashion.“The fundamental problem with much of fast fashion is that its social and environmental costs are not taken into account. The environmental costs of materials and fabric are mostly offshored. The production that takes place in the UK often only pays half the legal minimum wage.“So who is accountable for water and chemical pollution abroad, precarious work and employment, the undercutting of compliant manufacturers, the pollution from delivery and lack of recycling at home? Brands might find it difficult to make £5 fast fashion dresses and be socially and environmentally sustainable.”Carol Kane, the co-founder of Boohoo, told MPs the £5 dress was a “loss leader” drawing people to the website. She said the company employed three people in Manchester, three in Leicester, and 10 in China to carry out audits at their producer factories each month to ensure proper working practices.

But it has the potential to change everything in the long run.The impressive margin is first due to people’s sense of injustice, triggered by the decision to repeat the elections. A share of the vote even shifted directly from the AKP candidate to the opposition Republican People’s party (CHP) candidate. Polling by Istanbul Economics Research suggests that the motivation for this shift was the perception that İmamoğlu’s win had been unfairly challenged.But he was also able to develop a conciliatory narrative that appealed to these voters. He provided a fresh alternative to inhabitants of Istanbul fatigued from years of acrimonious and exclusionary political rhetoric. (As a result, İmamoğlu’s campaign should be examined closely for its global implications in the fight against populism.) Last, he was particularly effective in coalescing Turkey’s fragmented opposition, which included this time the CHP, but also the secular nationalist İyi party, as well as the pro-Kurdish Peoples’ Democratic party (HDP).The wide margin of the opposition’s win precludes a new challenge scenario. İmamoğlu will become, once more, the new mayor of Istanbul. And his victory constitutes a clear longer-term threat to Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s hegemony.New contenders are also likely to interpret this outcome as a window of opportunity. In particular, the political movement rumoured to have been set up by the former AKP minister Ali Babacan will be encouraged by this clear sign of growing grassroots disenchantment with the ruling party.More importantly, Sunday’s result is likely to lead to a rethink by the AKP leadership. The shock must be momentous. It is surely the most severe interruption in Erdoğan’s electoral winning electoral streak. The future of Turkish politics will depend on how this result will be interpreted by Erdoğan himself and the lessons that this experienced and able politician will draw from this reversal of his political fortunes.At stake may be the future of the AKP’s alliance with the Nationalist Movement party (MHP). One conclusion could be that this coalition has become too constraining for Erdoğan. For instance, the overhyped nationalism influencing the conduct of Turkish foreign policy is a byproduct of this political arrangement and so is the hardline approach to the Kurdish question both domestically and in Syria. Even more importantly, the political leadership may be compelled to question the benefit of the extreme centralisation of power ushered in by the transition to a presidential system a year ago. For a majority of the Turkish population, the presidential system does not seem to be functioning as advertised.These are admittedly difficult questions for any political leader. And so shall they be for Erdoğan. But his answers will define the longevity of his political movement at a time when İmamoğlu has emerged, with his remarkable win in Istanbul, as a credible contender for Turkey’s leadership.• Sinan Ülgen is the executive chairman of the Istanbul-based Edam thinktank and a visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/36968431c9b152e540a42484467f00b34a025738/0_117_3520_2113/master/3520.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0add80572de588a39cbf288abafa19c2","title":"found wallet prove us researchers lost honesty","story":"Which is all well and good, but how honest are you?

Another, possibly more helpful, way of looking at these statistics is to say that there will still be only half a dozen assistants that matter: Apple’s Siri, Google’s Assistant, and Amazon’s Alexa in the west, along with their Chinese equivalents, but these will have billions of microphones at their disposal, listening patiently for sounds they can use. Voice is going to become the chief way that we make our wants known to computers – and when they respond, they will do so with female voices.This detail may seem trivial, but it goes to the heart of the way in which the spread of digital technologies can amplify and extend social prejudice. The companies that program these assistants want them to be used, of course, and this requires making them appear helpful. That’s especially necessary when their helpfulness is limited in the real world: although they are getting better at answering queries outside narrow and canned parameters, they could not easily ever be mistaken for a human being on the basis of their words alone.There is solid psychological research to show that voices of lower pitch are perceived as more authoritative by both men and women. Higher-pitched voices are associated with submissive, helpful and caring characters. These are all impressions that make the voice assistants more often used and ultimately more profitable. In the late 1990s, BMW had to withdraw and reprogram the satnav system in one of its models because German drivers complained that they did not want to take instructions from a female voice. The automated call centres for brokerage firms in Japan give stock quotes in a female voice, but confirm transactions in a male one.In these instances, the technology adapts to pre-existing stereotypes, and so helps to perpetuate them. This will become increasingly important as children learn from their own interactions with a voice assistant. But this gendering is not inevitable.In some markets, Britain among them, Google offers a male voice for its assistant, though Alexa and Siri are always female.Male voices are also used by assistants in Arab countries, in many of which gender equality is not a mainstream ideal. A recent Unesco report also draws attention to the counterintuitive gendering of the field of computer technology. In Arab countries, and indeed in India, there is a far higher proportion of women studying computer science than in the west. It is those countries where gender equality is most advanced that have the greatest imbalance of male over female students of computer science and, consequently, of software developers.This was not always the case. Software was once a field in which women worked on equal terms with men. A woman, Grace Hopper, gave the world the term “bug” – as necessary to computer science as zero is to mathematics. But within a generation, from about 1980, the profession became overwhelmingly male. These were also the years in which programming became associated with the acquisition of huge fortunes. Bill Gates may not have been a better programmer than Admiral Hopper, but he certainly ended up a whole lot richer. This imbalance is wrong, and it matters. As voice assistants move into bedrooms and kitchens and follow us around on our phones, conscious effort will be needed to eliminate prejudice that harms both men and women whether they’re building the software or using it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e869ced2f9404773d28e2a00e432535d0c9e855/0_70_3559_2135/master/3559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f03ea2b29a61d2483616826ce592b4a5","title":"the guardian view on tory leadership politics may not survive brexit","story":"The threat by a Conservative minister to bring down the government of the next party leader if he attempts to leave the European Union without a deal shows how the Brexit virus, having hijacked the Tory machine, could end up shutting it down. It would be wrong to regard such warnings as a bluff. When push comes to shove, such MPs are likely to be in no mood for compromise. This attitude will have been hardened if Boris Johnson becomes party leader despite his obvious flaws – especially since Brexit has radicalised Conservative members so much that they would rather break up the United Kingdom than not leave the EU. Depressingly the no-deal option is openly flirted with by both leadership candidates, shamelessly proffered to Tory members in exchange for their votes.It is important to remember that even with the DUP’s support, a few Tory rebels can bring down a wayward government by leaving it. What also seems clear is that the new Conservative leader will not have a majority for either his central policy or for his government. That means Theresa May will in all probability have to assess which party leader will command a majority in the Commons. If it is not the Tory leader then it will be Jeremy Corbyn. If neither can put together the votes then Britain will be heading for a general election. Where Tory rebels would go from there is a tantalising question. Some have argued that the shape of the civil war in the party resembles the infighting that was a prelude to Robert Peel’s 1846 repeal of the Corn Laws, which protected British grain against cheaper imports. Peelites such as William Gladstone, who split the Tories by defecting to what ended up as the Liberal party, could justifiably claim to be on the side of the future rather than the past. That is still a seductive argument that could be used by their would-be heirs today.However, the recent experience of Change UK has shown that while there are many contenders for the inheritor of Gladstone’s mantle, their claims have yet to be realised in substance. Well-established mainstream parties are not given to significant splits in the modern era – not least because no substantial breakaway has given rise to a significant new competitor or one that could ally with an existing rival. Both Labour, which endured a traumatic schism in the 1980s, and the Tories are being stretched by Brexit. For the Conservatives there is a more existential threat because it faces a surgent rightwing nationalist Brexit party of Nigel Farage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f857caab081a06e58ebf6bb3cf8028626b4d0934/0_36_2150_1291/master/2150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c259d76acbdcd679aba87e5e82252a29","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of needle","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘needle’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘needle’.Share your photos of what needle means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 26 June at 10am.

But, 15 years later, he’s part of a movement intent on taking it to EuropePlaying tape-ball in Lahore, joining a game in a Leyton car park, coaching at Lord’s – it’s not a bad trajectory.Adnan Choudhry, one of the UK’s strongest proponents of a relatively unknown version of cricket called tape-ball, refers to his sporting journey as a “remarkable thing”.Although relatively few fans in England are aware of tape-ball, the sport – a version of street cricket developed in Pakistan – is growing considerably, both in its country of origin and farther afield.The name comes from the use of electrical tape to cover a tennis ball this ensures players have the opportunity to experience all aspects of hard-ball cricket – just with less outlay and less risk.Costly pads, helmets and gloves are not required, as the ball poses less of a threat than the traditional, leather-bound wooden ball. “Cricket is an expensive sport to play, but tape-ball makes it much easier,” says Choudhry. “You just need a bat, ball and tape.“You can play in a car park, a normal park, any place where you can run around a little. You don’t need gear or even 11 players – just a few friends. But you use the same type of skills that are used in hard ball cricket.”As a young child growing up in Pakistan, Choudhry was first introduced to tape-ball by his uncle, who played for his work team. Fascinated by what he was watching, the 10-year-old began playing with his uncle on the dusty neighbourhood streets.At the time, it was a sport played mainly for fun, but over the past decade it has grown in popularity, and sponsorship has made tape-ball cricket a fully professional sport in Pakistan.“I played mostly with my friends when I was younger,” Choudhry says. “It was popular then, but now it’s grown all over south Asia and is expanding beyond the continent.“Players who are good enough are now able to play it professionally and choose it as a career. There are lots of tournaments and events, the players get paid, and there are coaches specifically for tape-ball.”When Choudhry arrived in England in 2004, at the age of 19, to study business at college, it was the first time he had ventured away from his family and his country.He knew there would be plenty of competitive hard-ball cricket played in his adopted home, but imagined tape-ball hadn’t been exported to the UK.But a friend from Lahore knew where there was a tape-ball game being played in a car park in Leyton, London – and it was this that helped Choudhry find his feet. “Playing cricket – tape-ball in particular – is how I made friends and connections. It opened up new doors for me,” he says.That first game in the car park quickly became a regular event, with spectators becoming players. “We created a team, and through tape-ball we were able to connect with some local clubs,” he says.Ace Avengers Lions – the club Choudhry helped form in 2016 that also plays T20 and T10 cricket – has grown in the past four years from just two friends to more than 100 members.Its creation was partly driven by the knowledge that children in his local Walthamstow area were unaware of pathways to playing cricket, or being able to easily find a club to join.Choudhry also works as a cricket coach and engagement officer for Capital Kids Cricket, an organisation that delivers cricket-related projects in London, as well as coaching on the Chance to Shine Street programme. Both organisations focus on providing disadvantaged people with the opportunity to participate in healthy, physical, activity.Once Waltham Forest council became aware of the work Choudhry was doing, it was keen to get behind the initiative and provide added resources and support.“This area is quite deprived, and a few years ago the kids here did not have easy access to sports. We are trying to bring tape-ball to a school level and introduce it to kids at a young age,” says Choudhry.It’s an aim shared by NatWest, who have spent almost 40 years championing cricket as a sport for all by partnering with organisations such as Chance to Shine. The national children’s charity engages young people in communities across the country, and uses cricket to create positive opportunities and show the sport is available to everyone.This year, Choudhry helped host a tape-ball event for the local community that was sponsored by Essex Cricket and Leyton Orient FC – with the football club hosting at their ground.Local primary and secondary school pupils participated, and 50 visually impaired students from nearby Joseph Clarke school also played an adapted version of the game.Later in the day came the main event, The Tornado Tape Ball World Cup – an eight-team tournament in which Choudhry’s Ace Avengers were victorious.It was a day filled with pride for Choudhry, who now has ambitions beyond the UK for tape-ball. “In the future, there are tape-ball teams from Germany, France and Belgium that we are hoping to bring over here to play, or we can travel to play them.”Playing and coaching cricket has enabled Choudhry to play at some of the sport’s most iconic grounds – the sort of thing most lovers of the game dream of – and he understands how fortunate he has been.“Now I do coaching sessions at Lord’s, and I’ve played at the Oval too. It’s a big leap from that car park. I can’t quite put it into words how amazing that journey has been.”For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy. A proud partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the charity Chance to Shine, NatWest champions cricket at all levels – from grassroots support for local clubs and getting more people involved in the game to supporting current and future England stars and helping fans cheer on their teams, however and wherever they choose.With NatWest, cricket is a game that has #NoBoundaries.

Formerly known as the badlands of the city, the area has now transformed into a lively neighbourhood.Following the , who moved into the music and art hub Kings Place in 2008, the legendary fashion and design school Central Saint Martins, which counts Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney among its alumni, took up residence in neighbouring Granary Square in 2011. More recently, big cultural players including Google, the House of Illustration, Universal Music, the Knowledge Quarter and Time Out have also arrived – bringing with them more people, ideas and creativity.But King’s Cross is far from “all work”. Making use of the Victorian brick viaducts that once held London’s coal store, the bright and airy 20,000 sq ft Coal Drops Yard has taken on a new life as a shopping and dining nirvana. The impossibly stylish redesign – undertaken by the award-winning King’s Cross-based architect, Thomas Heatherwick – is topped off with an already iconic “kissing roof”, which will soon be home to Samsung’s new flagship store.And hang out they do. King’s Cross, which is home to one of the capital’s main railway arteries and the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras, has always been busy with people passing through but, now, it’s a destination in its own right.Already home to an enviable collection of foodie hotspots and cultural highlights – from the KERB food market that sets up for lunch service in Granary Square three days a week, to the nearby British Library and Wellcome Collection, both just a short walk away – when Coal Drops Yard arrived in October 2018, it was seen by many as the icing on the cake. Home to more than 50 stores and restaurants, many of which are young, independent businesses, every archway is filled with thought-provoking products and tantalising flavours.When it comes to fashion, Coal Drops Yard is definitely adding to the conversation, with a unique and eclectic range of brands and boutiques from a three-storey Cos store (which doubles a space to celebrate the art and design that inspires their clothes) and stylish Fred Perry outlet, to independent boutiques such as S120 and Form\u0026ampThread, and menswear heavy-hitters, Universal Works, to name but a few.“We’ve always envisioned King’s Cross as a microcosm of the city – it’s a erse community where people live, work, study and socialise,” explains Anna Strongman, partner at Argent. “In Coal Drops Yard, we’ve aimed to create a unique destination that connects all types of visitors through our combination of shops, restaurants and a vibrant year-round cultural events programme.”With so much change taking place in such a short space of time, it’s fair to say the area’s blossoming into a creative neighbourhood has taken some people by surprise. “When I first moved to London almost seven years ago, I wouldn’t have imagined King’s Cross would be considered a ‘fashion hub,’” says Central Saint Martins alumni and 10 Magazine’s fashion and features assistant, Helena Fletcher.Not everyone is as shocked by the area’s metamorphosis, though. “Generally, when creative industries move into a space in any city, that space then becomes desirable over time,” explains Adam Murray, fashion lecturer at Central Saint Martins.For Henry Graham, creative director and co-founder of Wolf \u0026amp Badger, which has a three-storey concept store in the main yard, Coal Drops Yard is a destination that really stands out from the competition. “In what is an increasingly homogeneous retail landscape, the King’s Cross Central Limited Partnership should be applauded for their courage in proactively seeking out innovative and unique fashion and lifestyle retailers, all of whom, through their stores in Coal Drops Yard, bring a new experience not only to the immediate area but London as a whole,” he says.To discover more about Coal Drop Yard’s unique stores, restaurants and packed diary of cultural events, head to coaldropsyard"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f3d097778ab111c26c86e3b8fe5fea864eccf22/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1e58e11bb84077052d628a1977cda3b","title":"what 14bn buys 1800 miles of cycle lanes or one big roundabout","story":"Greater Manchester’s Bee Network has just £160m of the cash it needs, unlike a junction near BedfordAlmost exactly a year ago, Chris Boardman – the Olympic champion turned walking and cycling commissioner – unveiled a bold vision: Greater Manchester was to turn itself into a Dutch-style cycling paradise by building a 1,000-mile network of walking and biking routes called Beelines, after Manchester’s civic symbol, the worker bee.A year on, the scheme has changed its name to the Bee Network after a rather embarrassing copyright infringement, and has expanded to cover 1,800 miles. Yet so far, work has only begun on one tiny section – a bit of towpath in Wigan known as the “muddy mile” – and the first wodge of money has already gone.Boardman said from the start that it would cost £1.5bn to build the network. This is not much, he will tell you, pointing out the government has agreed to spend £1.4bn upgrading a roundabout near Bedford and building a new 10-mile dual carriageway. That is £1.4bn on a project engineers boast could save drivers a whole 10 minutes.So far, Boardman has been given £160m – a brave move by Greater Manchester’s mayor, Andy Burnham, who was under pressure to spend it on roads instead, but far short of the full amount.That sum is now allocated, according to a report to be discussed by Greater Manchester combined authority on Friday. Over the past year, the 10 constituent councils have been submitting bids for the cash to pay for their parts of the Bee Network. More than 50 schemes have been granted “programme entry” so far, including a jazzy cycle bridge from Stockport railway station to the town centre and the creation of a “mini Holland” in a residential neighbourhood in Levenshulme.Assuming the GMCA approves the latest tranche of Bee Network schemes – which includes an “active neighbourhood” in Urmston, Trafford, a revamp of Ashton-under-Lyne town centre in Tameside and links to the new RHS garden in Salford – the £160m pot will already have been overspent by £74m.So where is the money going to come from? No one seems sure. Speaking on Monday at the launch of Our Network, Burnham’s vision for an integrated transport system, Boardman reiterated the full £1.5bn cost.He hopes the government will listen to a plea he made last week to consider the negative effect car-centric planning has on the environment and people’s health. In a letter to the transport secretary, Chris Grayling, he argued current economic appraisal models used by the Treasury to decide whether to fund a new motorway or a segregated cycle lane “do not take full account of the negative consequences of making private car use easier, nor do they take full account of the benefits of walking and cycling on our health, wellbeing and environment”.Burnham seemed to agree, saying on Monday: “Ask yourself this: which form of transport investment delivers the most benefit? Build roads and you may get an economic benefit but not an environmental benefit. If you invest in link, you deliver economic and environmental benefits. But if you invest in a walking and cycling network, you get economic and environmental but also health benefits.”Why then, you might ask, is Burnham exempting private cars from his forthcoming clean-air charges? He says it is because the levies would punish the least wealthy drivers in society, who cannot afford to upgrade to cleaner vehicles.But driving is already the preserve of the rich, with the most disadvantaged people disproportionately likely to live near the busiest roads with the dirtiest air. In south Manchester, one primary school cannot open its windows because the air is so polluted from the neighbouring Princess Road.In 2016, the Royal College of Physicians estimated ambient air pollution causes 40,000 premature deaths a year in the UK, at an estimated social cost of £22bn per year. Adjusting these figures proportionally to account for population, this means there are 2,000 premature deaths in Greater Manchester per year, where child asthma rates are already twice the national average. Then there is the cost to businesses of congestion, estimated at £1.3bn a year.“We have to stop building for cars,” said Burnham, as he plugged an as-yet-unfunded plan to bring the UK’s largest public bike-hire scheme to Greater Manchester next year.It is all fine talk. But until the government starts to see investments in cycling and walking as more important than making car journeys 10 minutes quicker, we will continue to risk life and limb on unsafe roads, breathing filthy air."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2aaec8d749e846e8f141924ce71068024d41f187/0_18_2364_1418/master/2364.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=249a86c8a06ad189c24fe5ce35ca67a2","title":"teenagers in films coming of age good boys stand by me boyhood","story":"Like Eighth Grade, Boyhood and the new comedy Good Boys, the most authentic coming-of-age movies feature casts still in the throes of adolescence Film has a sometimes troubling relationship with authenticity. However, in coming-of-age films, the authenticity of having child actors in the roles gives the films a certain flair that makes them shine. One notable example is the forthcoming Good Boys, a raucous coming-of-age film for tweenage boys. It features three lead actors who are only a few years older than the 12-year-olds they are playing. There is a touching innocence that marks their performance and produces memorable scenes, such as mistaking their parents’ sex toys for nunchucks and indoor swings. In films about the experience of growing up, there is a certain flavour that can be mimicked but not recreated by older actors.Eighth Grade is another film to be applauded for its awkwardly sweet look at what it means to be a schoolkid in the digital age. Elsie Fisher slots naturally into protagonist Kayla’s hunched posture and curtain of hair that protects her from the outside world. Having started filming almost immediately after finishing eighth grade herself, her performance as Kayla is all the more riveting for the way she taps into her own recent experience. This is what creates the film’s cringey charm.This is hardly a recent phenomenon. Garance Marillier was only 18 when she played Justine in Raw, the French feminist cannibal phenomenon that shocked Cannes with a ferocious portrayal of burgeoning teenage sexuality. Stand By Me has stood the test of time because of the boyhoods of River Phoenix and co, endearing them to new generations of audiences. Richard Linklater’s Boyhood went a step further, taking 12 years to film, while boy actor Ellar Coltrane grew into a young man. Comparing these films to Good Boys and Eighth Grade, it is encouraging to see that the essence of growing up hasn’t changed, even if most of it is now done online.This isn’t always the case. There are a slew of coming-of-age films that feature young adults playing teenage characters – Beanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever in Booksmart, Saoirse Ronan in Lady Bird, even Rachel McAdams in Mean Girls. They give no less convincing performances because of their age, but there is a subtle difference: because they are recalled rather than recent, their performances are overly enhanced versions of how an adolescent might act. Stockard Channing was 33 when Grease was filmed this reveals itself in Rizzo’s knowing attitude to sex, which stems from Channing’s age and experience. While this makes Rizzo a fan favourite as someone to aspire to, it creates a fiction of adolescence that isn’t realistic for any teenagers watching the film.It doesn’t always work flawlessly. Early Harry Potter films are more vital for their nostalgic value rather than the young trio’s acting chops – but a film series about a young boy navigating his way through wizarding school would have felt false with an adult actor in the main role. We were all teenagers once and have our own experiences of what that was like there is something special that can be learnt from allowing the young to take centre stage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/610b8521e8e5c916a50b901e385679344fb0c947/0_8_5313_3187/master/5313.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70642c698c52b14879b86aefa5693561","title":"pork chops garlic roast turnips recipe thomasina miers","story":"Rediscover the humble turnip, roasted with garlic and oil, and served with pork chopsIt was the chef Rowley Leigh who alerted me to how good turnips are, with their sweet and delicate flavour.

Initially the atmosphere was good.“Cameroon fans next to us were in full voice creating a great atmosphere,” they said. “There were a few issues with the stewards early on because they were in the wrong seats but they continued to sing and cheer.”Usually the lack of segregation of fans is not a problem in women’s football but, as tensions rose on the pitch, Cameroonian frustration at VAR decisions was reflected in the stands.“Once the VAR decisions happened, the atmosphere soured off the pitch as much as on the pitch,” reported the England fans. “Some fans became quite aggressive with stewards, one or two pushed stewards and were led out. There was also verbal abuse aimed at anybody in Fifa gear on the pitch at half-time.“Just as people calmed down, the second-half disallowed goal kicked it all off again. It didn’t help that Fifa kept showing the replays on screen. A couple of people threw cups on to the pitch at one point. We felt safe, just very uncomfortable.“The aggression and hostility was very much aimed at Fifa but I think not knowing what was going to happen on the pitch and how that could impact the fans was a little nervy. It’s not something we’ve ever experienced before at a game. Security lined the steps between our stand and theirs and officials escorted us out of the stadium through the VIP area.”Fifa said in a statement: “The post-match debrief highlighted that a number of Cameroon fans had moved to the seats behind the team benches during the match in order to create a ‘fan block’.“This required management by stadium stewards who, in the interests of all spectators, moved other ticket holders into hospitality seating. Although there was some verbal exchange between Cameroon supporters and stewards, there has been no report of any physical confrontation.”Fifa is expected to comment further on events around the match, which included Cameroon players twice engulfing the referee and refusing to restart the game following the intervention of VAR.The president of the women’s football committee at the Confederation of African Football, Isha Johansen, who is president of the Sierra Leone FA, said: “Whilst remaining proud of our African teams that participated in the Fifa Women’s World Cup, yesterday’s match between England and Cameroon reflected badly, not only on African women’s football, but African football on the whole.“It is an issue which will be addressed and dealt with, at the appropriate levels of governance.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dd81c16a172d2f331ecdf9ee73c416552f5915b/0_57_5153_3092/master/5153.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=245656ed180e45a62b0791de8e33bb4a","title":"super agent mino raiola player manager football deals","story":"One morning in late 1992, at Ajax’s old training ground, Bryan Roy arrived to clear out his locker and say his goodbyes. After four years with his hometown club, he was on his way from Amsterdam to join Foggia in the first of Mino Raiola’s many significant transnational deals between football clubs. The previous evening, when Ajax had played Feyenoord, a fan held up a hand-lettered placard. “Bryan bedankt,” it said. Thanks, Bryan.Not always have football fans expressed such gratitude on the departure of one of Raiola’s clients. This summer, depending on how things work out, Manchester United’s supporters are unlikely to send Paul Pogba on his way with warm wishes for a successful future in Madrid or Turin. The prospect of that £100m-plus deal became more likely last week when, during a promotional visit to Japan, the French midfielder volunteered his readiness to accept a “new challenge” away from Old Trafford. Some might think that helping Ole Gunnar Solskjær to rescue a great club from the doldrums represents enough of a challenge for anyone, but that would not be Raiola’s way.A controversial figure, particularly in Manchester, where he is detested by both Alex Ferguson (who once called him a “twat” during face-to-face negotiations) and Pep Guardiola, the agent is free to negotiate on Pogba’s behalf only because the court of arbitration for sport upheld his appeal against a worldwide three-month ban from all football activities imposed by Fifa in May. The sanction was first imposed by the FIGC, the Italian football association, but the nature of the alleged irregularities was never officially disclosed.On the other hand, Ajax may yet be grateful for the agent’s part in negotiating a supersize fee for Matthijs de Ligt, their 19-year-old captain. According to a report in the Sunday Times at the weekend, Juventus – a club with which Raiola has often done business – are the favourites to pay around £75m, with the size of Raiola’s commission a factor in the negotiations.There are plenty of big-time agents operating in football – sharing, for example, the £260m that members of the Premier League alone paid out to them last year – but the 51-year-old Carmine Raiola is among those who seem to incarnate most clearly the shift in the relationship between clubs and players. Having moved as a child from a small town near Naples to Haarlem in the Netherlands, where he helped with the family’s pizza restaurant, he enfolds his players in an embrace that goes beyond business meetings. Two years ago, having just moved Pogba from Juventus to United for a world record fee of £89m, he articulated this approach in an interview with Simon Kuper of the Financial Times. “I don’t see him as a client at all,” he said of the Frenchman. “In fact I dare to say, family.”Raiola’s football family is at the centre of this summer’s activity. While De Ligt appears to have his pick of almost all the top clubs, will Pogba join his compatriot Zinedine Zidane in a restoration project at the Bernabéu, or rejoin Juventus, where he won four consecutive Serie A titles and felt at home?If his methods have earned him the dislike of some powerful men, Raiola’s network of contacts, built up over the decades, has given him considerable influence. More than a quarter of a century ago Roy’s departure from Amsterdam cemented the ambitious young agent’s relationship with Zdenek Zeman, Foggia’s head coach. Two years later, when Zeman moved on to Lazio, Raiola brought him Pavel Nedved, much in demand after his performances with the Czech Republic at Euro 96. In 2001 Raiola moved Nedved on to Juventus, where he won the Ballon d’Or. In 2004 Raiola introduced another player to the club: Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the beginning of an odyssey that would take the Sweden striker to Internazionale, Barcelona, Milan, Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester United and LA Galaxy as Raiola surfed the shifting currents of the football market.In Ibrahimovic, barely out of his teens when they met at Ajax, Raiola found the perfect new member of his family. “I realised straight away that he was an arrogant bastard – in other words, just like me,” the agent said in an interview for the player’s most recent autobiography, the modestly titled I Am Football. But there was more to it. Raiola taught Ibrahimovic to curb his dissent on the pitch (“Tell me one single time when a referee has walked over and said he was wrong and you were right”) and, at Juventus, to follow the example of Nedved, who trained with obsessive diligence.“The things I learned from Pavel Nedved, I transferred to Zlatan,” Raiola said, “and what I learned from Zlatan I taught Paul Pogba. Paul saw in Zlatan what he sees in himself – a lad from the streets, big in stature but extremely technical – and he recognised the attitude: win, win, win.”Not much of that commitment to winning was on view in a red No 6 shirt during the final stages of United’s season. But players are iniduals, and do not always react according to a template. Raiola’s major failure was with another man who saw himself as a kid from the streets, big in stature but extremely technical the trouble with Mario Balotelli was that actually playing football took second place to the things his talent brought him.For a Balotelli, a Pogba, a De Ligt or an Ibrahimovic, there is only one career, and they depend on a Mino Raiola to ensure that the rewards last a lifetime. For Raiola himself, this is just another summer of playing the market, of spotting weaknesses to which he can supply the antidote, and of counting the proceeds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e54f60048e6b44c702afad7a6bf6d15f2f2d2850/0_71_4700_2820/master/4700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de6c01de57a066a3e9502e1d4b96a0d0","title":"why are the best footballers in the world suing their bosses","story":"The Women’s World Cup is nearing the knockout stages, with the tournament favourites, the US, in blistering form.

Thanks for reading. A good start to the tournament in terms of a result for the Ivory Coast, less so in terms of performance. Jonathan Kodjia celebrates with fans, throwing his shirt into the crowd. South Africa were limited in outlook, and limited when having to chase down an equaliser. It could be a tough road for them to get to the last 16.90+2 min: There were four minutes added on to the 90. South Africa not making much of a fist of forcing that final chance but a Zaha foul gives them one. Ooof, Vilakazi gets to the knockdown and smashes the ball into the sky. Euro Stu Baxter is enraged his man didn’t do better with that.90 min: Zaha, down in the left-hand channel, forces a corner after making a weaving run to the byline. South Africa fail to get it clear and Zaha plays keep-ball in the corner, before conceding a goal kick.89 min: Great save from Williams! Pepe gets chance to whip in a ball for a free-kick with his left foot, and and it was flying in. Only fingertips prevented it going in. 87 mins: Two more Ivorian subs: On comes Doumbia and Cornet, and off go Coulibaly and Gradel, who had already left the field in the cramp stretcher. 85 min: South Africa should have had a penalty as Veldwijk was bundled over by Traore. No VAR but it would surely have been given by our new computerised friends. VAR does not come in until the quarter-finals.83 min: That corner came to nothing and Kessie takes it forward. Zaha gets a chance to play in Kodija but South Africa hurriedly clear. Then Gradel almost gets Kodija in and fails.81 min: South Africa try to pick a way through and have to settle for a corner. Veldwijk comes on for Mothiba, and will be the target. He looks a big lad. 79 min: Tau, the liveliest player for South Africa, and who has been the architect of their most dangerous moments from set pieces, looks to be flagging. He gives away a tired free-kick.77 min: Near disaster for the Ivorians as Gbohouo drops the ball from a South African cross. He gratefully drops to the floor to snaffle the ball. He has not been convincing at all. 75 min: South Africa sub at long last: Maboe for Vilakazi.74 min: Wonlo goes down with cramp. The Algerian referee is not sympathetic, and asks him to leave the field. He does so on a stretcher, which seems excessive. A drinks break breaks out. 73 min: Europe’s Stuart Baxter is sticking to his guns, and has not made a sub just yet. His South African players’ tired legs may not thank him for that. 71 min: The Ivorian fans are now in fuller voice and grooving away in the stands. Their team has an expected if not fully deserved lead. 69 min: What can South Africa do? They haven’t shown enough in attack. They now have Zaha to contend with, as he comes on for Seri, who had a poor game.66 min: That was what the Ivorians had been trying to do all game, and the South Africans had looked wise to. Kodija’s finish was not superb, but it was enough. Wonlo and Gradel’s contributions were crucial. At last! Wonlo plays it out to the left, and Gradel slides it across first time. This time,Kodjia cannot miss.64 min: Traore averts danger when Tau escapes on to a long ball, and goalkeeper Gbohouo panics. 61 min: This is turgid, let’s be honest now. Kanon is booked, and he looks mystified. Footballers often look mystified when decisions go against him, but this time he was justified. He seemed to do little more than put the ball in touch. Thankfully, Aurier clears the resultant free-kick. 59 min: Aurier whips in the ball but it’s cleared at the back post when Gradel was coming in dangerously. 57 min: Ouch, a heavy collision and one that could be heard around the ground. Gradel jumps into the back of Maboe. The referee, who is a real stickler, waves a yellow card. Meanwhile, Wonlo is asked to leave the field to change his shirt by the Algerian fusspot. 55 min: This time, Pepe releases the ball quickly but Kodija was looking in the other direction. This has been a poor show from the start of the second half. 54 min: When will we see Zaha? That might change things up for the Ivorians, but he will need someone to give him the ball. Meanwhile, Pepe is wasteful as he finds space. Kodjia was the out-ball, but it never got to him. 52 min: Hlanti, on a surge forwards from full-back, gets down the left, but his cross to the middle is unable to find a South African teammate. 50 min: That Ivorian midfield of Seri and Kessié, two players with big reputations, have been disappointing. Perhaps they are struggling in the heat. 49 min: Ivory Coast begin on the front foot, just as they did the first half. South Africa are again back in big numbers.47 min: Gradel surges on and forces a corner. Mothiba, back from the front line, comes back to head the ball clear. 46 min: Aurier launches the ball immediately into touch. Not a great start though he was aiming for Pepe, which may bode better. We are back, with the Ivorian players geeing themselves up in the tunnel. Their first half was a disappointment.  colleague Nick Ames, on location, hold a similar view of that 45 minutes, as well as kicking against the man. The heat hasn’t helped but it’s been no classic. Ivory Coast might be ahead, had Kodjia done better with the best chance of the match, but South Africa have been organised and look to have a threat at set pieces.45 min: Two minutes added on. It’s been bitty, with our Glaswegian referee Ghorbal now asking Aurier to leave the field because of his shin socks not being correctly tethered in. 44 min: Pepe, transfer fans, has looked assured in possession and a cut above when he has the ball, supplying the moment of the match so far with that free-kick. Thing is that he hasn’t seen nearly enough of the ball. 43 min: South Africa’s latest corner causes trouble again, but they are a little slack in attack themselves. Worth pointing out that Seri, channelling his Craven Cottage self, has now been booked for lax foul in midfield. 41 min: Gradel and Pepe link but it is South Africa who instead go on the break and Gradel is forced to run back to prevent the counter becoming more dangerous."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56f65f36f98f5c08449ef6b7852b0c3bf1b6e835/0_300_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6073d16bfca977095068f6ec2cddbd7f","title":"andy mcnab at the age of 16 i learned to read and that knowledge was everything","story":"When he joined the army, the author had the reading age of an 11-year-old. But he can still remember the pride he felt at reading his first bookI joined the army straight out of juvenile detention at the age of 16. I was no criminal mastermind – I burgled the same block of flats repeatedly and was always going to end up getting caught.The education system had failed me I had attended nine schools in seven years and I didn’t see the point of it. I wanted to be a panel beater or a tube driver I had heard they made loads of money and you didn’t need much education for those kind of jobs. So that was it – why bother going to school? All I needed was to get a council flat, and I had that cracked because my parents were already on the list. All that was left was a Mark II Ford Escort and that would be me made.As it was, I was heading down a path that eventually led me to prison. Despite what Only Fools and Horses would have you believe, Peckham was never full of Del Boy cheeky chappies, having a laugh on the market then going off to drink cocktails in the pub. It was full of unemployment, drugs, guns and mindless vandalism. As a teenager I felt angry with people who had shiny new cars or spotless motorbikes, simply because they had stuff and I didn’t. So I used to kick their cars and bikes in, just because I could. I would vandalise people’s shops and mess up their goods, because they had it and I didn’t.It was while I was in juvenile detention that the army recruitment guys turned up and offered us an early release if we joined up. It sounded better than prison, so off I went. But the army turned my life around by opening my eyes and showing me that there were opportunities if I took the initiative and made something of myself. If I was willing to put in the effort.When my world truly changed for the better, I was in a classroom, alongside about 20 other boy soldiers, with an old sweat of a captain standing up front. He pointed out of the window, towards the barbed wire fence and the real world beyond, saying: “Out there, they think you are all thick. But you’re not. The only reason you can’t read or write is because you don’t read or write. But from today that all changes.”And it did. I soon learned that the reason I hadn’t been able to join the army as a helicopter pilot, as I had hoped, and had ended up in the infantry instead, was because I had the literacy and numeracy levels of an 11-year-old. I had no idea that I had a reading age that low I had just made words up when I didn’t know them, and usually ended up getting them wrong.It was just before I turned 17 that I read my very first book: Janet and John Book 10. I can vividly remember the sense of pride and achievement I felt. It was meant for primary school children but I didn’t care. I had read a whole book, and I was hooked. From then on I read anything and everything I could get my hands on. Of course it took me a while to catch up with where I should have been, but whether it was a tabloid newspaper, a car magazine or a book, I just wanted to try to get as much knowledge as I could.I learned in those early days at the army education centre, and then again when I joined the SAS, that the most important thing you have is knowledge. There are always people falling over themselves to help you and teach you stuff, and you are never going to progress unless you keep learning. Literacy and numeracy levels for the average infantry recruit joining up now are still relatively low, and the incredible educational opportunities that the army offers makes it one of the few places with decent social mobility in the UK.For me, improving my literacy levels had another more surprising outcome. When I left the SAS, I was asked to write an account of the Bravo Two Zero mission and that led to the unexpected career change of becoming an author.I have spent quite a bit of time over the past few years visiting schools, prisons and workplaces, as well as army bases and businesses, to talk about my past and encouraging others to start reading and writing. The guys joining up now still have the opportunity to change their lives, just as I did. The message I give to all the lads that I chat to is that if I can do it, anyone can. If that is a message that even one of them takes on board and uses, then it has been worthwhile. The main gist of what I tell anyone willing to listen is that the best soldier out there is the one with a library card.Get Me Out of Here! by Phil Earle and Andy McNab is out now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f7c8640d31da81eebd99233c2805e38750b5c83/0_510_2000_1199/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=515cf20488462de45693dc43e28ca7ad","title":"feminist armpit hair revolution half statement half ornament","story":"Female body hair is becoming more visible in popular culture and, while the issue has been around for decades, the new enthusiasm for hirsuteness has a 21st-century twistI am usually late to catch on to shifts in the zeitgeist this one came to my attention just recently. While watching the HBO show High Maintenance, I noticed that Lee, the protagonist’s hip and beautiful love interest, was sporting hairy armpits.“Look!” I cried to my husband, as though I’d unexpectedly spotted a T-shirt emblazoned with the name of my favorite obscure band. For the past couple of decades, I have seldom shaved my armpits. Now, all of a sudden, I was on-trend.Among both celebrities and the masses, female body hair is sprouting all over. Ilana of Broad City has exposed her underarm growth so have Jemima Kirke and Zazie Beetz. In January of this year, Laura Jackson, a British college student, ran a campaign called “Januhairy,” urging women to grow out their body hair and post selfies on Instagram.In some ways, this phenomenon harks back to the second wave movement of the 1960s and 1970s, when feminists began to challenge restrictive beauty standards. At a famous march outside the 1968 Miss America pageant in Atlantic City, protesters ceremoniously discarded their bras and stiletto heels many feminists of that era also ditched their razors and tweezers. But today’s renewed enthusiasm for female hirsuteness comes with a distinctly 21st-century twist.Unshaven women in 2019 often meet other criteria for traditional feminine beauty –they have sculpted eyebrows, wear lipstick or sexy lingerie – while proudly displaying their armpit hair. If the ethos of the 70s was a refusal to spend time and effort on cosmetics, the more common approach today is for women to curate different elements of their appearance, remaining conventionally attractive while deploying body hair as a feminist fuck-you: half-statement, half-ornament.Enter Billie, a New York-based subscription service that sells “razors built for womankind”. In January, the company announced a $25m investment from Goldman Sachs and other backers.Billie’s most radical feminist move is to show, in its various promotional materials, women removing actual hair from their bodies: models dragging razors up shaggy, moistened legs. As the company’s web copy notes, “Commercials show women ‘shaving’ perfectly smooth, airbrushed legs. Strange, huh?” In a move that is either generously self-undermining or shrewdly opportunistic (or both), Billie also runs Project Body Hair, an image library of hair in all sorts of places it’s not supposed to be.One of Billie’s models is Hale, a 19-year-old musician and student at Bard College. On Billie’s website, Hale sits on the floor against a bed, wearing a frilled white tank top. She is smoothing the hair on her head back with arms raised, revealing undisturbed axillary fuzz.Hale hit puberty early, she told me, and her body hair was dark and noticeable. At one point, “I shaved literally everything,” she said. “I shaved my whole stomach when I was in elementary school, because I didn’t like my happy trail.” But in high school, she began to question the hairlessness ideal, and realized that “having autonomy over my body didn’t make me less attractive or less valuable”. Now, she sometimes, but not always, removes hair from her legs and other body parts, but never from her armpits. Until recently she waxed her unibrow, but as it grows back, she’s started to think it’s “really cute”.Billie’s branding strategy may come across as fishy – they do sell razors, after all. But it seems to fit right in with the emerging ethos around body hair: celebrating women’s choices as a hodgepodge of inidual decisions about how to adhere to or violate cultural norms.As Georgina Gooley, Billie’s 33-year-old Australian-born co-founder, told me, “If you choose to shave, we have a great product for you. If you don’t, we have other products as well.” (The company also sells lotion and body wash.) With Project Body Hair, she says, “We weren’t sending the message that shaving is an expectation. We were saying shaving is a choice.”Back in the 1970s, the conversation sounded quite different. As Rebecca Herzig writes in her 2015 book Plucked: A History of Hair Removal, two camps emerged in the second wave movement.The very first full issue of Ms. Magazine, in July of 1972, featured an article titled Body Hair: The Last Frontier. It criticized the shaving norm as an “embodiment of our culture’s preoccupation with keeping women in a kind of state of innocence, and denying their visceral selves”. The time, money and psychological energy required for depilation were oppressive. Hairlessness was also infantilizing – it made women look like prepubescent girls. The social norm suggested, not very subtly, that there was something inherently wrong, gross and dirty about women’s bodies as they naturally were.But another faction of feminists, led by Betty Friedan, had a different take. Friedan believed the preoccupation with body hair was counterproductive. She considered these concerns a trivial distraction from more important issues, such as professional opportunities and subsidized childcare. She also thought they harmed the cause of feminism by casting feminists as hairy, ugly, man-hating weirdos.I came of age in the 1990s, a midway point of sorts. My two best friends and I stopped shaving in high school. For me, this decision was not explicitly about feminism, but about an allegiance to my idea of authenticity (not to mention my allegiance to laziness). It wasn’t that I didn’t care how I looked I wanted to look like I didn’t care how I looked. I wanted to be attractive, but I did not want to invest effort or enlist artifice into making myself so. Any such measures, to my 16-year-old mind, would have been cheating.At the same time, I usually felt self-conscious about my body hair, and often wore pants or long skirts. Displaying smooth, bald legs would have felt like selling out, but I felt a different sort of discomfort displaying hairy ones. I envied one of my friends whose leg hair was fine and wispy. Mine was not. (Later I resumed shaving my legs.)Back then, in my recollection, body hair did not register much in the cultural conversation. The founders of Instagram were in middle school. Feminism was in something of a lull, with a few exceptions such as the Riot Grrrl scene. My favorite magazine, Sassy, did embrace feminism, but not in a way that involved challenging beauty norms very aggressively. As far as I recall, nary a patch of stubble could be found on the waifish bodies of their models.It’s hard to say exactly when what Hale refers to as the new “body-hair movement” emerged – she describes it as “non-boys taking up space and deciding that they’re not going to adjust to the norms”.But she remembers thinking something was afoot when dyed armpit hair became fashionable a few years ago. One of the pioneers of that micro-trend was Roxie Jane Hunt, a hairstylist in Seattle.Hunt, 35, shaved as a teenager, but, she says, “I always hated the action of doing it. It felt like a big chore but also a little bit of violence against my own body.” When her daughter was about two, she saw Hunt shaving and asked her why. “I realized I didn’t have a good enough answer,” Hunt says. She grew out her armpit hair, and found it “much more sexy and natural”.In 2014, on a lark, she and a friend dyed their underarm hair “ethereal blue”, and Hunt posted photos of the colorful pits on her blog. “The blogpost kind of went viral from there,” she says. She described the attitude with which they approached the exercise as “sort of joy. It opened up a little more imagination.” Many people have since posted pictures of their “unicorn pits”, dyed in all the colors of the rainbow.If body hair has historically been invisible – too shameful to even show in razor commercials – this aesthetic makes it ultra-visible. In that sense, it takes the pro-hair ethos to its extreme. But in another sense, this practice is the opposite of the “let it all hang out” approach: it is, after all, hard to think of a grooming choice less natural, less laissez-faire, than polychromatic armpit hair.The look is also highly social-mediagenic, destined for virality. And social media, for both dyed and virgin body hair, is obviously a key part of what makes this round of hair affirmation different from previous eras. Women are not only refusing to conceal their body hair they’re flaunting it.A long-running debate within feminism has been whether we should respect women’s choices – even if they seem to result from oppression – or whether only certain “liberated” choices merit approval. The new body-hair acceptance advocates land squarely in the former territory. When I was growing up, a common catchphrase was “I’m not a feminist, but …” followed by some statement of support for feminist principles, such as equal pay. Now, much more common is something like the reverse: claiming the mantle of feminism no matter how un-feminist the position may seem.A theme that came through loudly in my conversations with young women was that we should judge nothing – except perhaps judgment itself. “I think the 70s wave of feminism was outright rejecting femininity. We don’t need makeup, we don’t want to be housewives,” said Ashley Armitage, a 25-year-old photographer who shot one of the Billie marketing campaigns. “Now it’s like, wait a second, you can be a feminist and a housewife. You can shave.”Surveying this new world of body hair, I wondered: are women making these choices because they think body hair is feminine, or despite the fact that they don’t think it’s feminine? Is there ever tension between their aesthetic preferences and their values?Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the prevalent reluctance to judge, no one wanted to say that they didn’t like any particular aesthetic choice. According to Gooley, the Billie co-founder, she found a range of attitudes in her focus groups and market research. Some women think “it’s a patriarchal view to force women to shave. Other women are like, ‘I just think it’s really cute. I like my underarm hair.’”Just as there’s a mix of motives, there’s also a series of decisions – not a one-time resolution to always shave everything or never shave anything. “So many people, maybe sometimes they’ll shave, sometimes they’ll grow their hair out,” says Armitage. “Sometimes they’ll shave their legs, sometimes they’ll grow their armpit hair.” Considering this reality, Billie’s pitch starts to make a little more sense.So far, this is all sounding very kumbaya: the shaven and the waxed and the hairy and the semi-hairy all getting along famously, showering each other with love and likes in a judgment-free festival. There is some truth to that: this discourse is refreshingly peaceable.But of course, it’s not all rainbows and unicorns. For all the love that the photos of body hair have generated, they have also, inevitably, attracted trolls. MaryV Benoit, another Billie model, told me about the comments on the campaign: “Seventy percent of them would be, ‘Oh, that is awesome.’ Thirty percent would be these weird men that would be like, ‘You girls need to shave.’” Some of the comments were nastier. And some came from women.Posting a picture of your hairy self online takes guts. You know that not everyone will approve, and some will let you know it. Merely going out in public with female body hair takes a different sort of courage. You’re less likely to hear direct insults, but more likely to get funny looks, unmediated by a screen.Female hairiness is still far from mainstream. But the more people who brave the all-caps comments and the whispers and stares, the less shocking it becomes. This is how norms change. And one of the few real upsides of social media, in my view, is its power to accelerate that process of dismantling dubious norms – not, in this case, in order to replace the old one with a new, equally unforgiving one, but to challenge the need for any norm at all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/575adb2d877310d9d9943cefdb000d9083258f9d/0_180_2352_1411/master/2352.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f4113a32593aea098dfea250d2705d2","title":"dave bartholomew taught the world to rock n roll fats domino","story":"The man who discovered Fats Domino has died aged 100, leaving over 4,000 songwriting credits and a fantastic legacyDave Bartholomew has died in New Orleans aged 100. While his passing is unlikely to attract the kind of accolades given to many deceased musicians, Bartholomew was a giant, a man who helped shape the sound and direction of both rhythm and blues and rock’n’roll while indirectly helping shape ska and, much later, rap. Bartholomew liked to state, “I invented the big beat”, and this was no idle boast: if any one musician can be given credit for shaping the sound of the US after the second world war, it was Bartholomew.Bartholomew was born in Edgard, Louisiana, in 1918: a small town whose African American populace worked in sugar mills or on the docks servicing the river boats. Bartholomew’s father played tuba with jazz bands, shifting the family to New Orleans in 1933, where he worked on river boats and in bars. Here, the musically precocious youth began playing trumpet in local jazz and brass bands. He served in the US military during the war, returning to New Orleans in November 1945. Forming his own band, Dave Bartholomew and the Dew Droppers – named after the locally famous black music hotel and nightclub, The Dew Drop Inn – Bartholomew forged rhythm and blues out of jump blues and swing. A local reporter wrote of Bartholomew’s band in 1947: “Putting it mildly, they made the house ‘rock.’” Within a decade the western world would be rocking to Bartholomew’s sound.In 1947, Bartholomew made his debut record for DeLuxe Records. It sold well locally and he scored his first national hit in 1949 with the suggestive Country Boy. That same year, while playing in Houston, Texas, Bartholomew was approached on the bandstand by Lew Chudd of Imperial Records, a fledgling, Los Angeles-based independent record label then concentrating on selling Mexican records Chudd asked Bartholomew if he would be interested in working with him.Soon Bartholomew would serve as Imperial’s New Orleans A\u0026ampR man – scouting and signing talent, then producing, arranging, often songwriting for and playing on the sessions. In 1949, Imperial’s first two R\u0026ampB chart hits both featured Bartholomew’s many talents: Jewel King’s 3 x 7  21 and Fats Domino’s The Fat Man. Bartholomew had found Domino playing in local bars and recognised the portly youth’s star quality: together the two men adapted Junker’s Blues, a song about heroin addiction, into The Fat Man. Lew Chudd initially hated it but it was an immediate hit with black listeners, selling over a million copies. The Fat Man is now often called “the first rock’n’roll record”.Bartholomew left Imperial in 1950 after a dispute over money and concentrated on making his own records, cutting the street party anthem Shrimp and Gumbo, proto-rap The Monkey and the innuendo-laden My Ding A Ling (the tune Chuck Berry would make his only ever UK No 1 in 1972) while also producing Lloyd Price’s 1952 debut single Lawdy Miss Clawdy (a R\u0026ampB No 1 that would soon be recorded by everyone from Elvis Presley and the Beatles to the Replacements and Lemmy). Imperial lured Bartholomew back in 1952 and, in 1955, he and Domino would set off on an extended run of hits – Dave producing and co-writing the songs and leading a band that featured several musicians now hailed as pioneers (drummer Earl Palmer, saxophonist Lee Allen, and guitarist Walter “Papoose” Nelson). They made Fats a superstar and introduced the world to New Orleans R\u0026ampB.Bartholomew kept busy throughout the 1950s, issuing both his own records and producingwriting others – these include Smiley Lewis’s One Night (later a hit for Elvis Presley) and I Hear You Knocking (a 1970 UK No 1 for Dave Edmunds) and Shirley \u0026amp Lee’s Let the Good Times Roll (producerband leader only). In Jamaica, Bartholomew’s productions were hugely popular and early ska developed directly from New Orleans R\u0026ampB.The British Invasion that began with the Beatles in late 1963 shifted listeners away from the warm, horn-heavy New Orleans music Bartholomew specialised in, and Chudd sold Imperial to Liberty Records that same year. Bartholomew continued to work as a producer and band leader – once Domino began touring the world it was Bartholomew who lead his magnificent band – but, by the late-1960s, had cut back on his workload. He had over 4,000 songwriting credits and some of these proved extremely lucrative. In recent decades he lead his own Dixieland jazz band, playing the music he had grown up learning from his father, a New Orleans homeboy to the end.Bartholomew’s immense musical talent was matched by his self-confidence and discipline. He succeeded at a time of extreme racial segregation and brutally exploitative recording deals, yet never lost control of his publishing or the direction he wanted to take. A tall, proud man, he did it his way – RIP, Mr Big Beat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58794d1a2f6ccd87cc31f385c2067b4f8b2bf0a2/0_68_5470_3283/master/5470.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c9fc4b5503162d5c4ef3e3ea141b73e","title":"iran rejects fresh uk call to release nazanin zaghari ratcliffe","story":"Foreign minister Andrew Murrison’s diplomatic visit to Tehran falls flatThe Iranian foreign ministry has dismissed a fresh UK call to release Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the Iranian-British dual national in jail on espionage charges, despite it being delivered personally by a Foreign Office minister.Andrew Murrison made the appeal for Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s release on his first visit to Tehran, where he quickly discovered the low standing with which Britain is held in Iranian government circles.Iran’s deputy foreign minister, Seyed Abbas Araghchi, said Zaghari-Ratcliffe would have to serve her sentence, denouncing a hunger strike by her husband, Richard Ratcliffe, outside the Iranian embassy in London as “blackmail”.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is arrested at Imam Khomeini airport as she is trying to return to Britain after a holiday visiting family with her daughter, Gabriella.Her husband, Richard Radcliffe, delivers a letter to David Cameron in 10 Downing Street, demanding the government do more for her release.She is sentenced to five years in jail. Her husband says the exact charges are still being kept a secret.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u0027s health deteriorates after she spends several days on hunger strike in protest at her imprisonment.Iran’s supreme court upholds her conviction.Her husband reveals that Zaghari-Ratcliffe has fears for her health after lumps had been found in her breasts that required an ultrasound scan, and that she was now “on the verge of a nervous breakdown”.New Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt meets with Richard Ratcliffe, and pledges We will do everything we can to bring her home.She is granted a temporary three day release from prison.Zaghari-Ratcliffe is on hunger strike again, in protest at the withdrawal of her medical care.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt takes the unusual step of granting her diplomatic protection - a move that raises her case from a consular matter to the level of a dispute between the two states.The UK upgrades its travel advice to British-Iranian dual nationals, for the first time advising against all travel to\u0026nbspIran. The advice also urges Iranian nationals living in the UK to exercise caution if they decide to travel to Iran.Richard Ratcliffe joins his wife in a new hunger strike campaign. He fasts outside the Iranian embassy in London as she began a third hunger strike protest in prison.Araghchi said: “The Islamic Republic of Iran’s judiciary will not be influenced by such acts of blackmail, and those convicted of espionage must serve their terms.”Ratcliffe, a tireless campaigner for his wife’s release from a Tehran jail for the past three years is on the 10th day of a hunger strike in solidarity with his wife, who is protesting against her conditions in Evin prison. She was arrested in April 2016 and given a five-year sentence for espionage, a charge she denies. At times the Iranians have threatened a second set of charges.Their five-year-old daughter, Gabriella, has been deprived of her weekly visit to see her mother in jail, possibly because the Iranian authorities are angered by Richard Ratcliffe’s high-profile protest. Araghchi also criticised the UK government’s support for the US, saying: “It appears that the British government’s entanglement with the predicament of Brexit has prevented it from having a correct understanding of the global realities. Immature companionship with America’s bully-style measures will result in nothing but an increase in the Iranians’ historical aversion to the UK policies.”He also raised the UK’s outstanding £400m debt to the Iranian nation going back more than 40 years, which is related to the British government’s refusal to honour a contract for Chieftain tanks sold to the Shah of Iran in 1976, but never received. Araghchi called for an immediate settlement of the debts, stressing that the UK government’s refusal to do so was not acceptable or justified.The debt issue has been a running sore between the UK and Iran, with Iran pursuing it through the courts for years only to be met with UK resistance over whether it was legally able to pay the debt to entities that were subjected to sanctions. Boris Johnson, when he was foreign secretary, once briefed newspapers that the UK had decided to pay the Iranian debt – it then emerged he had failed to win Whitehall’s agreement.Murrison, on the first of his round of visits, was also given a lecture on Britain’s historical interference in Iran by Kamal Kharazi, a senior foreign policy adviser to the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.Kharazi told the UK minister: “Britain has a very negative perception in the minds of people of Iran.”He cited the first world war when the UK entered Iran and caused a famine the 1901 agreement of an oil monopoly in the country given to William Knox D’Arcy the granting of a tobacco monopoly in 1891 the British-backed coup against the former Irainian prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953, and the support for Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war.Kharazi said: “I explained these reasons for this perception and said that the British government must take serious steps to offset this perception.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f995a5bf1d3fa9f2c77ef5036d2b96e0b74b5e2c/0_0_5133_3229/master/5133.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ef8f62a33dc3284c6605479cfbb057c4 1760w","title":"brexit party peterborough byelection postal vote","story":"Nigel Farage says investigation is needed after Labour won in Peterborough by 683 votesThe Brexit party is to launch a formal legal challenge against the result of this month’s Peterborough byelection, where it was narrowly beaten by Labour, claiming that allegations of corruption connected to postal votes need to be investigated.Nigel Farage, the party’s leader, insisted the challenge was about more than the loss to Labour by 683 votes, saying the wider use of postal votes was open to abuse and needed to be investigated.“I know people will say: ‘Oh, but it’s sour grapes.’ It isn’t,” Farage told a press conference in London.“Actually, as far as I’m concerned, this is about a lot more than Peterborough. It is about a system that is wide open to corruption, to intimidation, to bribery, to abuse on a whole number of levels. I have mentioned this a number of times in the past.”The party plans to issue a petition under the 1983 Representation of the People Act, which allows election results to be challenged retrospectively for reasons including errors or corruption connected to the polling.Such challenges are rare, with the last successful one coming in 2010, when the Labour minister Phil Woolas was ejected from his Oldham East and Saddleworth constituency after a specially convened election court upheld a complaint that Woolas had knowingly lied about his Lib Dem opponent.Police investigated five complaints connected to the Peterborough byelection on 6 June, in which Labour’s Lisa Forbes defeated the Brexit party’s Mike Greene in a vote Farage’s new organisation had been tipped to win.Labour has rejected any wrongdoing, and police have ruled that no offences were committed in three of the five complaints so far looked at.The Brexit party chair, Richard Tice, conceded that the evidence so far seemed uncertain, but said that was why a full investigation was required.“You’re absolutely right – there are a lot of rumours, a lot of hearsay, some of which is just that,” Tice said. “There is evidence emerging. That will be presented to the electoral court. It’s wrong to prejudge that, or announce that now.“It’s only by having a full petition that we can truly get to the bottom of what may or may not have happened here, but also the lessons for the broader system.”He said there were many unanswered issues: “Why were there rumours that morning that the Labour party had won by 500 votes? There are so many questions. We need answers. And the only mechanism available to us to give us those answers is to lodge a petition under the Representation of the People Act 1983. So we will be doing that this week.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c06f29fa20e080f7368c82a7910bf0a4a09158c/0_242_5197_3118/master/5197.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27ecde46a36e8e1799c217f3959b53d3","title":"hmrc pushes massive vat increase for new solar battery systems","story":"Homes hoping to shrink their carbon footprints by installing a solar-battery system face a steep VAT increase from October under new laws proposed by HMRC.Meanwhile, home coal supplies will continue to receive the lower VAT rate.The Renewable Energy Association (REA) said the rise “contradicts the government’s commitment to tackling climate change” only weeks after parliament declared a climate emergency.It also warned that the move would push back the take-up of solar-battery systems by years even as the UK works towards becoming a net zero carbon economy by 2050.Nina Skorupska, the REA’s chief executive, said the increase would “create a barrier to British homes and businesses who are seeking to take action on climate change and reduce their bills by installing solar with battery storage”.She said the government “should be doing all it can to install these technologies rather than enacting barriers”.HMRC has blamed EU tax laws for the planned rise because they rule out lower VAT rates for energy saving equipment under state aid rules.The European court of justice ruled in 2015 that energy saving materials should not have been receiving the reduced rate of tax. This led to an increase in VAT for solar systems installed at new-build homes in 2016, but did not affect the majority of houses which would require retrofitting. Those houses will now be affected by the higher rate.The REA has called on HMRC to cancel the latest increase, which would come into effect as the UK prepares to leave the EU. Any rise should be cancelled as soon as possible after Brexit, the trade group added.The calls have won the support of more than 11,000 members of the public who have signed a petition by the green energy supplier Good Energy to call off the increase.Juliet Davenport, Good Energy’s chief executive, said the rise was “possibly the worst way to respond to a climate emergency”.“The government should be seeking to be a world leader in renewable technologies, but it’s damaging our successful solar industry and putting green jobs at risk. We urge the Treasury to listen to the thousands of petitioners who want to play their part in fighting climate change,” she said.HMRC brought the secondary legislation to parliament on Monday after carrying out an industry consultation on the plans in April and May this year. It has said it is offering as much tax relief as possible for home renewable energy systems while ensuring the UK is in line with EU law."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be0d7a831f0ba9a41a39d126ad63c1439f61229e/0_117_6720_4031/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6a70fd3ae4d7641ac6a07f469e5f9fd","title":"however look logic brexit backstop refuses to yield irish","story":"None of the options proposed as a solution to keeping the Irish border looks workableThe question, set less by Brussels than the logic of Brexit, is how the UK government can in one move leave the European union’s single market and customs while also maintaining the flow of trade and people on its one land border with the bloc in IrelandThe fact that the existence of the land border in question cost more than 3,600 lives over 30 years led to the British government in December 2017 restating its commitment to avoid “a hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls”.Avoiding a backdoor for smugglers into the single market is additionally regarded as essential by Dublin and the European commission, as is avoiding crippling extra bureaucracy on Irish businesses.The so-called Irish backstop in the 585-page withdrawal agreement – to remain in place “unless and until” an alternative solution for keeping the border open is found – offers one solution by doing two key things.First, Northern Ireland stays within the EU’s regulatory regime, and under direct jurisdiction of the European court of justice, so as to allow a single market for goods on the island of Ireland.Second, the whole of the UK shares a customs territory with the EU to avoid any checks on goods both between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.But rejected three times by the Commons on the grounds that the UK could be tied into the backstop indefinitely, leaving the government unable to sign its own comprehensive trade deals, the withdrawal agreement is said by Boris Johnson, still the frontrunner in the Tory leadership battle, to be “defunct”.What is the alternative? In recent days, Johnson has suggested that the EU and UK could give themselves more time to work on the problem by relying on “Gatt 24 or whatever it happens to be” to provide for a “standstill in our current arrangements”.Under article XXIV of the general agreement on tariffs and trade, tariffs would remain at zero even under a no-deal exit on 31 October for up to a decade, it is said. The agreement could additionally leave the Irish border open while the two sides sought a new accommodation.The problem for Johnson, in the words of the trade secretary, Liam Fox, is that this “isn’t true”. Article XXIV is only relevant if there is an an agreement in principle on a free trade deal. It gives the two parties time to turn an interim deal into a final one.But the EU has said that the first and necessary step towards a trade deal is ratification of the withdrawal agreement. And the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has said that without a legally binding guarantee that a hard border will not reemerge there will be no withdrawal agreement.In the light of this, interest has been aroused in a 201-page report published on Monday by a non-government organisation calling itself the Alternative Arrangements Commission.Backed by two former ministers, Nicky Morgan and Greg Hands, it has suggested that by 2022 a solution could be in place using a mix of technology, trusted trade schemes, mobile checks on food and animals within a new joint Irish-British Sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) zone, special economic zones to push customs checks away from the border and a certain amount of looking the other way.The problems with it are legion. By imposing checks within a newly delineated border zone it fails the central task of avoiding new checks, and creates targets for terrorists in the new mobile veterinary vans. The burden of Brexit is put on Irish businesses. The exemptions on checks for many crossing the border will set off alarm bells for those concerned about the integrity of the single market.But the central problem for Brussels is that the plan is theoretical.There remains no certainty at all that the complicated IT systems, democratic consultation on the creation of new economic zones or negotiations with the European commission on the finer detail would be finalised by the end of the transition period of “standstill” relations.The Irish backstop would then have to remain to guarantee the avoidance of a hard border.

It will report by October as part of Labour’s plans for a “green industrial revolution”.McDonnell said: “I am setting up a review group to overview the financial system as it currently relates to the climate emergency, in terms of both where and how it is causing or exacerbating the problem of climate change and where and how it could be providing solutions to problems.”He repeated his warning that firms listed on the London Stock Exchange that failed to meet environmental targets risked being denied access to the main equity market, forcing them to become private businesses or list in other jurisdictions.“This means that when we delist companies that fail to meet environmental criteria from the London Stock Exchange, investors can be confident that their money is not going on making the world uninhabitable for their children,” McDonnell said.Labour has already set out wide-ranging plans for a network of regional banks and an enhanced post office network to promote investment.McDonnell said these institutions would be given the dual role of increasing investment in green technologies and making a profit.The shadow Treasury team has already met representatives from Extinction Rebellion, the radical environmental protest group, to hear their ideas for addressing the climate crisis.Proposals from the independent Committee on Climate Change, headed by the former Tory minister John Gummer, and from the National Infrastructure Commission have already played a large part in Labour’s thinking, McDonnell said.However, while Labour has committed to the target of reducing carbon emissions to net zero by at least 2050, in line with the government’s aim, there are few policy details to say how it would get there.The review of the City would include commercial banks, investment banks, pension funds, hedge funds, private equity and asset managers to cover areas of the City that often escape scrutiny.Labour has put together a panel to review how the government and the Bank’s new responsibilities can be implemented, including the former head of the civil service Lord Kerslake and the prominent City lawyer Peter Rice.“The UK is and will remain a hub for finance,” McDonnell said. “That gives us all the more responsibility to make sure that the lending that takes place here aids the tackling of the climate crisis rather than fuelling it.”Labour plans to offer a mix of stiffer regulation and tax incentives to promote “large-scale beneficial investment” to support growth.“But we will also fulfil our responsibility to ensure adequate policing of investments using the mechanisms available to us to require companies to live up to their climate change responsibilities,” McDonnell said.The Bank’s monetary policy committee currently sets Britain’s interest rates while its financial policy committee and the Prudential Regulatory Authority oversee the financial stability of the banking sector and City firms.An expansion of the bank’s role to encompass promoting investment and higher levels of productivity while separately supporting Labour’s decarbonisation of the economy would make it the most powerful independent central bank in the developed world.Responding to questions about Labour’s stance on Brexit, McDonnell said he would prefer to campaign to remain in a referendum or general election despite representing a constituency that voted to leave the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29d89fcbbc37c79071abdf4336c1c8aa6a90a379/0_124_7283_4372/master/7283.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8328f13fa358640637fd2f6621724a29","title":"tory members would not want muslim prime minister islamophobia survey","story":"Nearly half of Conservative party members would prefer not to have a Muslim prime minister, a survey into the scale of Islamophobia in the party has suggested.The party’s membership base, thought to be about 160,000-strong, will vote in a leadership ballot to choose Britain’s next prime minister in the coming weeks.Last month, the Muslim Council of Britain submitted 20 pages of evidence to the Equality and Human Rights Commission calling for an inquiry into Islamophobia in the party, with the Tory peer Sayeeda Warsi calling the problem “institutional”.It has also been alleged that the party chairman, Brandon Lewis, ignored requests for racist and Islamophobic incidents reported by members to be investigated.Hope Not Hate has written an open letter to Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt calling on them to publicly acknowledge the Islamophobia problem within the party and commit to tackling it if elected. They also want to see an independent body established to investigate the problem and the party to commit to an established definition of Islamophobia.Both Tory leadership contenders appeared to endorse an independent inquiry when challenged by Sajid Javid during a live televised debate last week. However, Johnson has failed to retract comments he made about women in burqas looking like “letterboxes” and “bank robbers”.McGregor said: “After months of revelations that Conservative activists and councillors have been belatedly suspended or expelled over Islamophobic or racist incidents, the fact that the overwhelming majority of members think there isn’t an issue is chilling.“The first step to challenge this crisis should be a show of leadership from Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson. They must both confront the racism of some party members and the complacency of others, state clearly that they accept there is a problem, and confirm their commitment at last week’s TV debate to a full and independent investigation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40a61619442bc3bd5f446cbce0ac26726766187a/109_466_3138_1882/master/3138.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2779427e9bcb68645ce2a2cb8c4fde14","title":"bacteria found in gut could help boost physical performance","story":"Scientists say certain species are more abundant in marathon runners after raceFrom go-faster stripes to energy gels, athletes have long sought ways to boost their performance. Now researchers say bacteria might also offer a helping hand.Scientists say they have found that certain species of bacteria in the gut appear to be more abundant in marathon runners after a race. They also claim that when such bacteria were transferred into mice, the creatures showed an enhanced athletic performance.The team said the link could be down to the way these bacteria break down lactate, a substance linked to fatigue during exercise. Lactate is created when the body uses glucose to produce energy under limited levels of oxygen.“We have shown that the microbiome may be a critical component of physical performance,” the authors wrote.However, others said it was too soon to say whether these bacteria would indeed aid performance in humans.Prof George Church of Harvard University, a co-author of the study, agreed but said clinical trials in humans would be conducted. However, if performance-boosting effects were to be found, this could create difficult questions about how to regulate athletes’ use of microbes or the substances they produce, he said. While previous studies suggested athletes might show differences in the makeup of the community of microbes in their gut – the gut microbiome – compared with non-athletes, the impact of these differences has been unclear.Writing in the journal Nature Medicine, Church and colleagues reported how they had delved into the issue by collecting and analysing daily stool samples from 15 athletes who took part in the Boston marathon and 10 non-athletic people who did not. Athletes gave stool samples both the week before the race – when they would be expected to do little running – and the week after the race.The team found that Veillonella bacteria were more abundant in athletes after they had run the race than before – although overall there was little difference in abundance on average between athletes and non-athletes.Similar changes were found in the analysis of stool samples from a further 87 athletes taken both before and after exercise, with the researchers also finding a post-exercise boost in the relative abundance of genes linked to the pathway by which Veillonella break down lactate.To test whether Veillonella could produce an improvement in athletic ability, the team turned to mice. In total 16 mice were administered with a strain of Veillonella taken from the stool of one of the runners another 16 were given bacteria that could not break down lactate. A few hours later the mice were put on an exercise wheel and allowed to run until they became exhausted. The treatment was swapped for each mouse and their endurance tested.The team showed that lactate passed from the bloodstream into the gut, while mice given a byproduct of the lactate breakdown process called propionate displayed improved performance on the running wheel.Church and colleagues are involved in the company FitBiomics, which is looking at the microbiomes of athletes to find bacteria that could boost performance and recovery, including Veillonella.Dr Orla O’Sullivan, a researcher in the APC Microbiome Institute at University College Cork in Ireland, said the research added to a burgeoning array of studies looking at the impact of the gut microbiome and probiotics on sporting performance.Since abundance of Veillonella appeared to rise post-exercise, and be linked to lower inflammation, O’Sullivan said the bacteria might be aiding recovery.But she urged caution. “What we have is an increase in Veillonella post marathon. There was increased endurance in mice but we do need to be careful to not presume same will happen in humans,” she said.If the bacteria is found to boost performance in humans, experts said it could open the door to a new way to improve athletic prowess – either by raising levels of Veillonella in the gut, or simply administering propionate.With the source of microbes in the body hard to trace, could this also lead to a new frontier of furtive faecal transplants?O’Sullivan thinks not, pointing out safety concerns – including that athletes might get more than they bargained for. “If athletes start poop doping then you are potentially getting beneficial microbes, but also you are potentially transferring pathogenic microbes,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/213e7f21e20882072c9ed72e5b326e92c0ed8167/0_41_4841_2905/master/4841.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60a6fc39869c5c9f26569e544ae97707","title":"mars rovers large methane discovery excites scientists","story":"Curiosity’s record-breaking measurement fuels speculation it is from microbial MartiansNasa’s Curiosity rover has detected its largest belch of methane on Mars so far, fuelling speculation that the robot may have trundled through a cloud of waste gas released by microbial Martians buried deep under the surface.Mission scientists announced on Monday that Curiosity had measured a record-breaking 21 parts per billion (ppb) of methane in the air in Gale crater, the rover’s landing site and area of exploration. The level is substantially more than the 5.8ppb it sensed on 16 June 2013.Curiosity touched down on the red planet in August 2012 and has recorded a number of sharp spikes in methane and a fluctuating background level of the gas that appears to rise and fall with the seasons.The latest measurement has excited some Mars enthusiasts because on Earth, much of the methane in the air comes from living things that release it one way or another as waste gas. But methane can have far more mundane origins than microscopic Martians, such as reactions between water and certain types of rock, and Nasa’s rover cannot distinguish between these.While Mars was once warm and home to coursing rivers and giant lakes, it is now exceptionally dry and battered with intense radiation. If any life exists on the planet, it would probably have to be sheltering deep underground.“With our current measurements, we have no way of telling if the methane source is biology or geology, or even ancient or modern,” said Paul Mahaffy from Nasa’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt in Maryland, US.The methane spike was recorded by the rover’s sample analysis at Mars (SAM) tunable laser spectrometer. After noticing the methane surge in data beamed back to Earth last week, mission scientists commanded the rover to perform follow-up experiments over the weekend.The measurement deepens the mystery of why a European Space Agency probe sent to Mars to nail down the origins of the planet’s methane has so far found no traces of the gas. One possible explanation is that any methane released on the planet is broken down before it reaches the altitude of the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO).In April, a team of Italian scientists traced a plume of methane on Mars back to a particular spot on the surface where the movement of a geological fault may have released bubbles of the gas trapped in Martian permafrost.Manish Patel, an Open University researcher who works on the TGO mission, said the latest detection by Curiosity was what the European team had been waiting for. Until now, the TGO has not looked for methane on Mars at the same time as Curiosity. “The previous ‘discrepancy’ in findings was always complicated by the fact that we never made measurements at the same time,” Patel said. “There was always a possibility that something was occurring in the atmosphere to trap or remove the methane before we arrived to measure it.”He added: “Now that both Curiosity and TGO are active on Mars, we have the chance to compare measurements made at the same time, which will allow direct comparison. Curiosity will likely continue to make measurements, and it will be interesting to see whether they still see the methane, or whether it disappears immediately.” In the meantime, scientists on TGO will examine their own data to see if any trace of the methane was picked up by their own instruments high above the Martian surface."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4e303285161fad0c3d4a7c3e924e751667741b/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=021fb721b2212a5b5aea6275acb0e8aa","title":"tell us has your camhs record affected future employment","story":"As part of an investigation into the issues people who have completed treatment face we would like to hear your experiences Hundreds of thousands of young people pass through the UK’s Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) each year.

This becomes obvious when listening to the England captain on the eve of the contest. He was so insistent that this was just another game. There were no extra nerves in the camp England play Australia regularly his team have played under this type of pressure before it is not a must-win game.Eoin Morgan is entitled not to over-hype the occasion and to keep his players cool. But the protestation that this is just a routine World Cup match was not entirely convincing. In fact, if England had beaten Sri Lanka at Headingley his view of Tuesday’s mouthwatering meeting with Australia would have more credence.It is true that England can lose at Lord’s and still control their own destiny in this tournament as they strive to satisfy the bare minimum of expectations: reaching the semi-finals. But if Australia prevail then the nerves really start jangling, however icy-calm Morgan may like to appear. Then England might have to win both their remaining matches, against India and New Zealand, neither of whom have been beaten so far.In that scenario India and New Zealand will probably have the luxury of playing with the certainty of a semi-final slot. This brings a dangerous freedom to their approach. Unlike England, they will not be haunted by the consequences of defeat. However, they will be motivated to defeat Morgan’s side.Both teams recognise the potency of the England lineup, their capacity to defeat any team on their day. They would calculate that their chances of winning the trophy are enhanced if England are not in the semi-finals. Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan, the other contenders for the semi-finals, offer less of a threat.A spotless Lord’s awaited the two sides on Monday. The hover cover was in place against the possibility of a sudden thunderstorm as the mowers delivered the finishing touches to the putting green outfield. There are no spare seats available. And whatever the captains say, there will be extra tension in the dressing rooms.With overnight rain on the horizon both captains might find themselves choosing to bowl first, an option that has diminished in popularity as the tournament has progressed. Morgan, given live grass on the pitch and dampness in the air, did not rule out playing just one spinner – presumably Adil Rashid – even though the inclusion of Moeen Ali as well leaves him with four in-form seamers in his side.On Sunday at Lord’s in the match between South Africa and Pakistan the spinners were effective despite a tinge of green on the pitch. The one certainty is that Jason Roy will not be fit to play and there is no guarantee that he will be available for Sunday’s game against India at Edgbaston either.England are trying to remain sanguine about Roy’s absence but this diminishes the threat at the top of the order. Indeed, if logic is to play any part in this contest – not always the case in much-hyped matches – then it seems that Australia have the edge among the openers. David Warner and Aaron Finch have been prolific at the top of the order, even if the former has surprised us with his modest strike rate. Currently they trump Jonny Bairstow, who looks in excellent touch in between the golden ducks, and James Vince, who always looks in fine form in between the 27s.Likewise Australia’s opening bowlers, Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins, have been excellent throughout – mind you, Jofra Archer and an improving Chris Woakes have not been too bad, either. The Australian captain uses his two gun pacemen shrewdly. Unless they are creating mayhem they bowl short spells even at the start of the innings so that Finch has the option to recall them mid-innings when he needs a wicket. England can afford to respect this duo and eye up the others.Beyond the opening attack England have greater depth: their support bowlers, Mark Wood, who is having a fine tournament, Ben Stokes and a variety of spinners, can be more penetrating – and trustworthy. The same applies to England’s batting down the order, especially if Stokes and Jos Buttler are in the zone.But ultimately it is about nerve. The serious players find a way to stay calm and to deliver when it really matters. The great ones crave a stage like the one provided by Lord’s, with every spotless white bucket seat occupied. This will not be the day to meander around the Nursery end uncorking a few bottles of bubbly while in search of old friends. It is one to remain glued to the seat and to watch the contest unfold because, contrary to Morgan’s pre-match musings, this matters more than usual."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b54320ebdc4b31a6383ed2e91094651dabbf74a6/0_269_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73542c4bfb208654aa389f724fc15154","title":"lamine diack trial money laundering corruption iaaf","story":"• Former IAAF president, 86, charged by French authorities• His son Papa Massata Diack and four others also face trialLamine Diack, the disgraced former IAAF president, has been ordered to stand trial on charges of corruption and money laundering.

And there’s a huge ovation at the end of the over – that’s the end of Shakib’s work today: 10-1-29-5.44th over: Afghanistan 191-8 (Shinwari 40, Dawlat 0) Play-and-miss first up from Dawlat and Afghanistan are going to fall well short once again.Rashid Khan can’t get hold of Mustafizur short ball and instead plonks it straight into the hands of the Bangladesh captain at midwicket.43rd over: Afghanistan 189-7 (Shinwari 36, Rashid 1) Rashid Khan looked as organised as any Afghanistan batsman when I saw them at Cardiff against South Africa the other weekend. But, as was the case back then, the top order has left too much to do.Got him! Najibullah goes for a big hit against Shakib, can connect with only fresh Hampshire air and Mushfiqur does the required behind the stumps. Five-fer for Shakib, to go with his fifty earlier on. Not a bad day’s work.42nd over: Afghanistan 184-6 (Shinwari 36, Najibullah 22) There may just be a few heart-rates creeping up among the Bangladeshi players and supporters. They could do with a wicket just to snuff out this little uprising. This pair bring up a 50 partnership from 41 balls thanks to some well-placed shots and some hard running. Seven from the Shaifuddin over.41st over: Afghanistan 177-6 (Shinwari 34, Najibullah 17) Shakib (7-1-10-4) returns. And those figures lose their edge. Najibullah scampers two from the first, then chips down the ground for a single. And from the last Shinwari smashes a six over long off.40th over: Afghanistan 166-6 (Shinwari 27, Najibullah 13) Two singles from the first two balls of Shaifuddin’s latest over, the second coming off a daft overthrow. And, a few balls later, he sends down a hideous leg-side wide. This pair are giving Afghanistan a glimmer – a teeny, tiny glimmer – of hope.39th over: Afghanistan 160-6 (Shinwari 24, Najibullah 11) Shinwari cuts through backward point for four! Fine shot but Mustafizur has him playing and missing outside off a couple of balls later. Six off the over. The Required Rate sidles past Nine and begins to wander in the vague direction of Ten.38th over: Afghanistan 154-6 (Shinwari 19, Najibullah 10) Najibullah, looking to be assertive, drives Mosaddek sweetly through the covers for four to bring up the Afghanistan 150 then scampers a single. 109 required from 72 balls.37th over: Afghanistan 147-6 (Shinwari 17, Najibullah 5) Mustafizuq struggles a bit for line here, spraying either side of the wicket. The batsmen work him around for six. 36th over: Afghanistan 141-6 (Shinwari 13, Najibullah 4) Actually I’m being a bit harsh on Shinwari there – Ikram had only himself to blame really. Najibullah thumps his first ball over the top for four, and Shinwari sweeps for four too. It’s a bit too little too late surely.Two appeals the first ball after the drinks break. Mehidy yelps for an lbw decision – not given – but it matters not because Ikram is run out by a direct hit at the non-striker’s end. Shinwari hasn’t run himself out but he’s helped scupper his young batting partner there.35th over: Afghanistan 132-5 (Shinwari 8, Ikram 11) Mustafizur returns. Nudge, nurdle and, from the last, nick! But there’s no one at slip so Ikram picks up a welcome boundary. And that’s drinks.34th over: Afghanistan 125-5 (Shinwari 7, Ikram 6) Mortaza once more. Ikram nudges to deep backward square leg for two and he’s unlucky to k a cut straight at the man at point. He’s looked more comfortable out there than any of his teammates thus far. And he nabs the strike off the last too.33rd over: Afghanistan 119-5 (Shinwari 6, Ikram 1) Ikram Ali Khil is next up. Shakib’s figures just keep getting better: 7-1-10-4 now.Shakib has another! Afghan finally looks to break the shackles but can only pick out the man on the midwicket boundary. 32nd over: Afghanistan 117-4 (Shinwari 5, Afghan 20) Mortaza brings himself back into the attack. Afghan misses out on a wide half-volley. The Required Run Rate wanders past Eight and purposefully strides in the direction of Nine.31st over: Afghanistan 113-4 (Shinwari 4, Afghan 17) Shinwari seems determined to run himself out, charging down the pitch pretty much every time he hits the ball before angry words from his partner send him back. Just a couple of singles from Shakib’s latest. 30th over: Afghanistan 111-4 (Shinwari 3, Afghan 16) That over has woken the crowd up – they were just beginning to snooze but the party atmosphere has returned. Four off Shaifuddin’s latest with a wild waft from Shinwari to finish things off.29th over: Afghanistan 106-4 (Shinwari 2, Afghan 13) Shakib now has spectacular figures of 5-1-6-3. What a player.It’s a bit early to say that’s that but it’s a really tall order for Afghanistan now. Mohammad Nabi, the main reason they got as close as they did against India, is the new man. And he’s gone, second ball! Shakib sneaks one between bat and pad and that really could be that.Gulbadin goes at last! He cover-drives Shakib’s first of a fresh over – not uppishly but there’s a man in at short cover to pouch a low catch.28th over: Afghanistan 104-2 (Gulbadin 47, Afghan 13) Gulbadin heaves for one and looks frustrated to find himself stuck at the non-striker’s end as Shaifuddin continues to rumble in. Afghan this time manages to find a single, though. Gulbadin celebrates with another awkward heave for a single. There’s no lack of intent but he’s still struggling to time the ball out there.27th over: Afghanistan 101-2 (Gulbadin 45, Afghan 12) A silly point comes in – I think it’s Liton Das under the lid. Afghan responds by blocking, blocking and blocking again. A fine over from Shakib – just one from it. The Required Run Rate waves merrily at Seven as it passes by and strides confidently off towards Eight. 26th over: Afghanistan 101-2 (Gulbadin 45, Afghan 12) A bit of pace for a change – Shaifuddin returns to the attack. A punch down the ground (one that the bowler deflects worryingly close to umpire Gough’s armpit) brings up the Afghanistan 100. Three from the over.25th over: Afghanistan 98-2 (Gulbadin 44, Afghan 10) Shakib (2-0-2-1) returns. Two from the over, the second coming off another bit of hesitant running, Afghan imploring his captain to stop, stop, STOPPPPP! as he comes roaring down the wicket. And then scrambling through for one.24th over: Afghanistan 96-2 (Gulbadin 43, Afghan 9) Mehidy continues into his seventh over. Asghar Afghan sweeps hard for four – lovely shot. I think I’m right in saying that’s the first boundary Mehidy has conceded in this innings. 23rd over: Afghanistan 87-2 (Gulbadin 41, Afghan 1) Gulbadin tries his best to get things moving, lofting Mosaddek over the covers for four, but the required rate has crept past Six and is striding confidently towards Seven, with a song in its heart and a whistle on its lips.22nd over: Afghanistan 81-2 (Gulbadin 36, Afghan 1) “As much as we’d like an Afghan win, this will go the way of the India game,” reckons Kevin Wilson. “They just can’t scratch around not losing wickets. Getting a run a ball or more over 30 overs just isn’t going to happen.” Yes, that does feel the way it’s going. The weak link before the tournament seemed to be their batting and that’s how it’s played out. They just don’t have a batsman who strikes any fear into the opposition. The whole lineup feels containable. Mehidy rattles through another one – 6-0-19-0.21st over: Afghanistan 79-2 (Gulbadin 35, Afghan 0) A fine bit of bowling from Mosaddek that. Advantage Bangladesh you sense.Mosaddek continues. And finally somethings happens – a push into the off, a misfield, and a farcical bit of running that at one point sees both batsmen stood stock still in the middle of the pitch, watching as the fielder prepares to pick up the ball and shy at the stumps. Hashmatullah just manages to scramble back … and there’s no run.But two balls later he’s gone! A lovely bit of bowling sees Mosaddek sneak the ball past Hashmat’s heave to leg and, with his back foot sliding out of the crease, Mushfiqur does the necessary.20th over: Afghanistan 77-1 (Gulbadin 34, Hashmatullah 10) Mehidy continues into his fifth over. Single, single, single, single, dot, dot. Even the thus-far boisterous Hampshire Bowl crowd has been lulled into a bit of a stupor.19th over: Afghanistan 73-1 (Gulbadin 32, Hashmatullah 8) Mosaddek concedes just one from his latest. We’ve not had a sniff of a wicket since Rahmat went and we’ve had only one boundary since the ninth over. It’s a war of attrition at the moment.18th over: Afghanistan 72-1 (Gulbadin 31, Hashmatullah 8) Hashmatullah unfurls the sweep once more, finally discomfiting the otherwise unpeturbed Mehidy. The batsmen have looked a little more sure of themselves, a little more assertive, since the drinks break.17th over: Afghanistan 65-1 (Gulbadin 27, Hashmatullah 5) Gulbadin needs some attention from the old magic sponge during the drinks break. He seems OK though. Mosaddek finds Hashmatullah’s outside edge on the resumption but there’s no slip so the batsman picks up a couple.16th over: Afghanistan 60-1 (Gulbadin 25, Hashmatullah 2) Mehidy is enjoying bowling on this pitch. Hashmatullah, Afghanistan’s leading runscorer in the tournament so far, sees out three dots then sweeps hard for a single. He goes to two from 14 balls. Mehidy’s figures read 3-0-6-0 after that one.15th over: Afghanistan 58-1 (Gulbadin 24, Hashmatullah 1) Mosaddek, fresh from a cracking little cameo at the end of the Bangladesh innings, comes into the attack, with Mortaza perhaps sensing he can sneak through a few overs cheaply while these batsmen are becalmed. And becalmed they are – Gulbadin, who should really have his eye in now, sees off five scratchy dots. At least from the last he launches over the top of mid off for a pressure-relieving four.14th over: Afghanistan 54-1 (Gulbadin 20, Hashmatullah 1) Hashmatullah finally gets off the mark with a dangerous single to mid on – Gulbadin was none-too-sure about that one but his partner screamed him through regardless. A jaffer from Mehidy to end the over – ripping and turning joyfully past the outside edge of Hashmat’s bat. 13th over: Afghanistan 51-1 (Gulbadin 18, Hashmatullah 0) And it’s more of the same from Shakib. Hashmatullah in particular is looking a little uncertain – he’s faced eight balls and is yet to get the ball off the square never mind get himself off the mark.12th over: Afghanistan 50-1 (Gulbadin 17, Hashmatullah 0) Mehidy form the other end as Bangladesh opt for a double dose of spin. A nudge for one brings up the 50 but it’s a tight and testing over from Mehidy. 11th over: Afghanistan 49-1 (Gulbadin 16, Hashmatullah 0) Ugh, that was rather ugly from Rahmat, and so unnecessary. Spin for the first time courtesy of the world No 1 all-rounder and leading run-scorer in the tournament Shakib Al Hasan. And it produces the breakthrough – a few dots crank up the pressure then Rahmat tries to smear the ball into the stands, mistimes, and Tamim takes a simple catch.10th over: Afghanistan 48-0 (Gulbadin 15, Rahmat 24) Shaifuddin once more and once more he’s nice and accurate. Just three off the over. This - Captain Obvious alert – has been a really solid start from Afghanistan.9th over: Afghanistan 45-0 (Gulbadin 12, Rahmat 24) Mortaza’s turn to drop short and Rahmat pulls hard for four down to backward square leg but the bowler strikes back with one that just holds its line outside off, flashing past outside edge and stumps. Gulbadin clubs over the top of mid on – mistiming it a touch – for three, then Rahmat carves sweetly through point for four more! That’s a very profitable over for Afghanistan – 12 from it.8th over: Afghanistan 33-0 (Gulbadin 9, Rahmat 15) Shaifuddin enters the attack, with Afghanistan perhaps just a little bit too comfortable for Mortaza’s comfort. A single each for the batsmen.7th over: Afghanistan 31-0 (Gulbadin 8, Rahmat 14) Rahmat shovels Mortaza into the leg side for a couple, then – hello! – skips down the wicket and attempts to find the stands at cow corner. He succeeds only in chipping the ball about two-thirds of the way to the rope, which says a bit about the awkward nature of this pitch."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/587e8ef27665a93f28adf26cab324166ef328b0b/0_188_5647_3388/master/5647.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad907b6ce79f6f719696bf7e79eed710","title":"idris elba kwame kwei armah tree interview bereavement","story":"The actor celebrates all big events in his life by wrapping his arms round a sturdy trunk. With the help of director Kwame Kwei-Armah, he has turned his obsession into a showIdris Elba has a thing about trees. He’s got a tattoo of one on his left arm, partially hidden today by a black T-shirt – but that’s not all. Whenever Elba needs to mark a major event in his life – birthdays, new years, that kind of thing – he heads outside and wraps his arms around a trunk. “I just feel a massive connection to the roots that are underneath, which are very high and wide, and to the oxygen that comes from the top,” he says. “And then there’s me in the middle … Idris Elba, tree-hugger!”He lets out a burst of laughter, as does the director Kwame Kwei-Armah. The pair are here today because they’ve collaborated on a new project called, funnily enough, Tree – an ambitious mix of music, dance and drama set to premiere at this year’s Manchester international festival. The pair have known each other for decades but this is the first time they’ve worked together. “The seeds are laid right,” Elba says, and the metaphors continue, with much talk of “cultivating” and “planting” in their creative process.The production’s “deepest roots”, says Elba, grew from his experience in South Africa playing Nelson Mandela in the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. For inspiration on how to emulate the man, Elba had looked to his own father, who shared Mandela’s infectious smile and similarly pointed with his middle finger – yet shortly after seeing the movie, his dad died. Elba felt compelled to revisit the country and make an album in his father’s honour – 2014’s Mi Mandela – that featured a song called Tree, “which is sort of on the nose, a love letter to my dad”.Now the two men are working with a cast that includes Alfred Enoch, the young black British actor who went to the US to star alongside Viola Davis in the hit series How to Get Away With Murder. Kwei-Armah smiles: “Alfie came to an early workshop, he got off the plane from Brazil, hadn’t even looked at the script. Thank God, because it was really bad then. I completely rewrote it.”Was the script a collaborative process, too? “We did it together,” Kwei-Armah replies, as Elba points towards Kwei-Armah and stage whispers: “He wrote it.” Not for the first time, they both laugh. Kwei-Armah continues: “Alfie came in, and literally within an hour, our magnificent choreographer, Gregory Maqoma, was holding him upside down.”The immersive nature of Tree has leaked into the rehearsal process, with the creators operating a rehearsal room where people are regularly invited in — including me. During the company’s morning briefing, which involves everyone in the space holding hands in a large circle, Kwei-Armah asks how everyone is. One performer speaks candidly about an encounter that reminded her how grateful she feels to be in the space. Another, Patrice Naiambana, mutters an in-joke under his breath that makes Enoch crack up laughing. Elba tells a story about being confronted by South Africans for playing Mandela despite not being of South African heritage.Earlier, he’d recounted how people had told him he shouldn’t be playing Mandela. “They said, ‘We’ve got actors in South Africa who are qualified.’ And our director was white, and our producer was Indian.”Eventually they won people over. “At the end of the process, people that were on that cusp about whether I should be there or not, were like, ‘Thank you, I can see you just as being a vessel in playing that.’” As with Kaleo, the protagonist in Tree, there was a sense of “coming home. You get what I’m saying?”Kwei-Armah does. “Not only do I get what you’re saying, I wish I had articulated that to the cast on day one. The beautiful thing about the DNA of this, the DNA of our lead character, is going, ‘Whoa, where is my legitimacy here, I’ve got to find my way home.’”But right now they’re just excited to present Tree to the world. “It’s lovely to be able to see something you’ve planted the seed of,” says Elba. “And repot it into a different form”.Kwei-Armah laughs once more: “This is why we’re going to keep working together. We’ve got to keep these garden metaphors going!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d1a04737d303865e461c16f2bb9582aa3e1021f/0_275_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb3b329b555a1432c12d5abca5e91b9e","title":"bitcoin passes 11000 on news of facebooks cryptocurrency plan","story":"The original cryptocurrency hits 15-month high as traders bet move will legitimise sectorThe price of bitcoin has surged above $11,000 (£8,600), its highest level in 15 months, amid renewed hype over cryptocurrencies after Facebook said it was planning to launch a digital currency next year.Bitcoin has risen in value by almost $2,000 in the week since the US technology firm revealed plans to create a cryptocurrency called Libra, in a move that could radically reshape the financial landscape with far-reaching implications for governments and central banks around the world.The original cryptocurrency had languished below $6,000 for much of this year and was falling out of the headlines as investors around the world gradually lost interest in the fad for digital assets.Some investors had been severely burned by bitcoin when its meteoric rise to almost $20,000 in late 2017 – which drew comparisons to the tulip mania of the 17th century – was followed by a spectacular collapse last year.Stoking fresh fears of the reinflation of the bubble, bitcoin hit $11,116.65 over the weekend, up from $8,539.81 at the start of June, before dropping back slightly to trade at about $10,800 on Monday afternoon.Analysts said the news of Facebook’s work on Libra was the prime driver behind the surge, as traders bet the adoption of cryptocurrency technology by a major global corporation would help legitimise the industry.Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at the financial trading firm Oanda, said: “Bitcoin has slowly – by its own standards – been rising in recent months but the launch of Facebook’s Libra has clearly been a catalyst for the recent surge.Facebook says Libra is a \u0027global currency and financial infrastructure\u0027 - a digital asset built by Facebook and powered by a new Facebook-created version of blockchain, the encrypted technology used by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The name Libra comes from the basic Roman measurement of weight. The abbreviation lb for pound is derived from Libra, and the £ symbol originally comes from an ornate L in Libra.Facebook claims it wants to reach the 1.7 billion people around the world who do not have access to a bank account.Facebook is likely to run into regulatory hurdles and antitrust concerns. The currency will be serviced by a collective of companies called the \u0027Libra Association\u0027. It functions as what is known as a \u0027stablecoin\u0027, pegged to existing assets like the dollar or euro, in the aim of making it less subject to the volatility that many cryptocurrencies experience.The Libra Association is described by Facebook as an independent, not-for-profit organisation based in Switzerland. Within the Libra Association will be a governing body called the Libra Association Council, comprised of a representative of each member of the association, which will vote on policy and operating decisions.Facebook claims that although it created the Libra Association and the Libra Blockchain, once the currency is launched in 2020 the company will withdraw from a leadership role and all members of the association will have equal votes in governance of Libra. The companies who contributed a minimum of $10m(£8m) to be listed as founding members of the Libra Association include tech companies such as PayPal, Ebay, Spotify, Uber and Lyft, as well as financial and venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, Visa and Mastercard.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhen the cryptocurrency launches, users can download Calibra, a digital wallet, that will allow them to send it to anyone with a smartphone. It will be available in Messenger, WhatsApp, and as a standalone app.It is not clear which countries the coin will launch in first, though Facebook said \u0027almost anybody\u0027 in the world with a smartphone will be able to download the app.“The publicity that the launch has once again brought to the space, combined with the legitimacy it offers, has understandably excited the community.”Rising tensions in the Middle East and mounting fears about the world economy have also stoked renewed interest among investors in bitcoin, which is sometimes viewed as a safe-haven asset similar to gold. The digital currency does not typically mirror the movements in wider financial markets during periods of turmoil.Gold prices have risen in recent weeks to the highest levels since 2013, as the US Federal Reserve could be forced into interest rate cuts to stave off a slowdown in the US economy. The European Central Bank has also said it could cut interest rates as growth falters in the eurozone.Unlike its run in 2017, which came largely from media hype stoking retail investors’ interest in cryptocurrencies, bitcoin’s tripling in value this year could have been the result of increased demand from professional investors such as fund managers and hedge funds.The Chicago Mercantile Exchange last week recorded an all-time high volume of trading in bitcoin derivatives contracts – sophisticated investments tracking the price of the digital currency only available to City banks and fund managers – with more than 5,000 contracts worth $250m.However regulators around the world have warned that Facebook’s entry into the world of cryptocurrencies could lead to greater controls and tougher regulations to protect consumers.Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, gave a cautious welcome to Libra last week. He said the central bank would support new entrants into the UK financial system, but warned that Facebook would need to meet the highest regulatory standards.“The Bank of England approaches Libra with an open mind but not an open door,” he said.At the weekend the Bank for International Settlements warned that big tech firms using digital currencies could undermine the stability of a banking system that had only just recovered from the crash of 2008."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19c5e0134c8aa2c090d1878458b517f446d3de72/218_0_952_571/master/952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=401a7278cf3d4b446e65cc852b65fe86","title":"john oliver mount everest last week tonight like the line at trader joes","story":"Last Week Tonight’s John Oliver explained the danger in the commercialization of climbing the world’s tallest mountainLast Week Tonight’s John Oliver discussed the danger involved in climbing Mount Everest, the world’s tallest mountain. First summited in 1953 by Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay the mountain has recently become a tourist destination, resulting in a greater number of fatalities. “Climbing Mount Everest has somehow gone from being a rare feat of extraordinary skill to something that looks like the line at Trader Joe’s.”The influx of climbershas left the mountain polluted with litter, with a clean-up expedition collecting 24,000lb of garbage. “There’s also a lot of human shit up the mountain which, thanks in part to climate change, is now sliding downhill in what’s been called a fecal time bomb. Which by the way, is a phrase that really should be printed on every baby onesie because it’s cute and it’s accurate.”Oliver explained there is an optimal season for climbing Everest, which this year shrank due to bad weather. Since the 1990s a boom in commercial expeditions had led to crowding on the mountain. Luxury expeditions can cost up to $130,000, with some coming with heated tents and dining tables. Sherpas are crucial to getting up the mountain. “For many climbers, Everest is not unlike Simon and Garfunkel. There is someone along for the ride to the top and there’s someone pulling all the weight.“Sherpas with an uppercase S are an ethnic group, sherpas lowercase S are the mountain workers, some of whom, but not all, are Sherpas uppercase S. Extra fun fact: a word that changes meaning when it’s capitalized is known as a capitonym. Now you have the perfect tidbit handy next time you want to completely self-destruct on the first date,” explained Oliver.One of the hardest jobs is securing the area for climbers with ladders and ropes to make the ascent easier. The Khumbu icefall is particularly fatal to sherpas and others, with huge blocks of ice prone to falling and huge crevasses. Paying clients only have to go through a few times but the sherpas must cross it almost 40 times a night to carry the climbers’ luggage.In fact, being a sherpa is among the most dangerous jobs in the world. “And the fact that they are risking their lives for the ambitions of well-off climbers is uncomfortable to square.” One TV presenter asked a sherpa about the task and the sherpa replied it was like family, leading the presenter to hug the sherpa. The presenter later said it erased the line between client and sherpa. “But it is client and sherpa,” pointed out Oliver. “That is not the warm embrace of family. That’s one man physically squeezing the white guilt out of another.”Everest offers two routes to the summit: one from the Tibetan side and the other from Nepal. The Tibet side is more difficult and the Chinese government has strict limits on who and how many people can go. The Nepalese side is easier, attracting two-thirds of climbers, with no limits on their quality or quantity. For a Nepalese permit, the only requirements are a fee of $11,000 and a doctor’s note deeming the climber physically fit. “That’s a pretty big loophole there, because even the least physically fit person on earth can get a glowing doctor’s note and I know this for a fact because he recently did,” said Oliver as a photo of Trump was displayed. “If Cirque du Soleil had half its trapeze artists be trained acrobats and the other half enthusiasts with $11,000 and their own tiger bodysuit, you would shut that shit down before someone got badly hurt.”Bad climbing companies rarely turn down inexperienced climbers. The Canadian Shriya Shah-Klorfine had no experience but was told she could succeed if she was determined enough. She died coming down the mountain, after reaching the summit. Inexperienced climbers can be a danger to themselves and others. Oliver showed a clip of climbers complaining about the inexperienced climbers in front who were holding up the line. “Think about the violent rage that you felt the last time you couldn’t walk down an escalator because a bunch of assholes were standing still. Now, imagine doing that for hours in freezing temperatures as your brain leaks slowly down your spinal cord.”Even Sir Edmund Hillary has expressed disappointment over the commercialization of the climb. He believes people just want to boast. “If it is just a summit photo that you want, faking it is probably the most ethically defensible way to get it,” said Oliver. The show even created a Photoshop site, thetopofmounteverest, for those who would like to do just that. “Climbing Mount Everest has become an industry with blood on its hands but no one can deny it’s become one of the most striking photos you have of yourself,” said Oliver."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b80d891ac0d9fb1ef8fbf0e310c85f83b9675bd0/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=588a999e9c802820356d7785f98e945b","title":"mike pompeo us saudi arabia talks iran united arab emirates tensions","story":"Sanctions target supreme leader and eight commanders of Iranian Revolutionary GuardDonald Trump has ordered new sanctions against Iran’s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, and other officials including eight Revolutionary Guard commanders in the latest step of an escalating pressure campaign.Iran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, will also face fresh sanctions in a few days, US officials said. He negotiated the 2015 nuclear deal with the US and other major powers, and has spearheaded Iranian diplomacy since.Signing an executive order in the Oval Office, Trump called the increased sanctions “hard-hitting”, saying they would deny the supreme leader, his office and and those closely affiliated with him access to key financial resources. “These measures represent a strong and proportionate response to Iran’s increasingly provocative actions,” Trump said.“We do not seek conflict with Iran or any other country,” the US president added. “I can only tell you we cannot ever let Iran have a nuclear weapon.”Standing alongside Trump, the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said the measures would freeze billions of dollars in Iranian assets.Tensions between the US and Iran have soared, with Washington dispatching warships to the Gulf, and Tehran threatening to resume higher uranium enrichment.John Bolton announces the deployment of the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and a bomber task force in response to \u0027a number of troubling and escalatory indications and warnings\u0027.Iran vows to enrich its uranium stockpile closer to weapons-grade levels if world powers fail to negotiate new terms for its nuclear deal.

Iran is allowed to enrich uranium, but increased production could lead it to exceed the stockpile limits in the nuclear deal.Senior Pentagon officer Vice-admiral Michael Gilday says the US has a high degree of confidence that Iran\u0027s Revolutionary Guards were responsible for the explosions on the four tankers in the Gulf of Oman.Saudi Arabia\u0027s King Salman hosts high-level summits in Mecca. He calls on the international community to use all means to confront Iran and accuses them of being behind \u0027terrorist operations\u0027 that targeted Saudi oil interests.Saudi Arabia says 26 people were wounded in an attack by Yemen\u0027s Houthi rebels on an airport in the kingdom\u0027s south-western town of Abha.Two oil tankers near the strategic strait of Hormuz were reportedly attacked in an assault that left one ablaze and adrift as 44 sailors were evacuated from both vessels and the US navy assisted.Iran’s Revolutionary Guards say they have shot down what they called a US \u0027spy\u0027 drone they claim was flying in in the country’s airspace. The US military confirm one of its drones has been taken down, but say it was in international airspace.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA treasury statement said eight senior commanders of the navy, aerospace and ground forces components of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) were also being targeted.“These commanders sit atop a bureaucracy that supervises the IRGC’s malicious regional activities, including its provocative ballistic missile program, harassment and sabotage of commercial vessels in international waters, and its destabilizing presence in Syria,” the statement said.Trump said he was willing to pursue dialogue with Tehran without preconditions, but the sanctions appear to make such talks even less likely, at least in the short term.Khamenei and his family are said to control a business empire worth tens of billions of dollars.“The supreme leader’s office has enriched itself at the expense of the Iranian people,” the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said. “It sits atop a vast network of tyranny and corruption that deprives the Iranian people of the freedom and opportunity they deserve.”Tension has been mounting in the Gulf since Trump withdrew the US from a multilateral deal in which Iran accepted strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions. Those tensions have culminated in the sabotaging of tankers in the Persian Gulf, and the shooting down of a US drone on Thursday. Trump ordered airstrikes in reprisal, but then cancelled them.“I think a lot of restraint has been shown by us, and that doesn’t mean we’re going to show it in the future,” Trump said on Monday.When confirming he had aborted the attack on Iran on Friday, Trump had said he would be imposing new sanctions, but he said the measures against Khamenei and others were not specifically linked to the downing of the Global Hawk drone.“You could probably add that into this” he said, but added: “This was something that was going to happen anyway.”Earlier on Monday Brian Hook, the US special envoy on Iran, said he had been holding extensive talks with US allies in the wake of the Gulf of Oman tanker attacks, when two vessels were damaged by explosions. He believed a global coalition to protect shipping was required.“There have been too many attacks. We could have had an environmental disaster and extensive loss of life due to reckless Iranian provocations,” he said.Hook said the G20 summit this week in Japan would be a good forum for discussions. As many as 17 countries had been adversely effected by the recent tanker attacks either directly or through crew, insurance or contracts, he said, and an international force might isolate Iran diplomatically as well as make it more perilous for Tehran or its surrogates to mount further attacks.Iran has denied responsibility for the blasts.Hook, seen as one of the hawks on Iran inside the US administration, said Tehran faced a choice: “They can either start coming to the negotiating table or they can watch their economy continue to crumble.”Tensions with Iran have been mounting since Donald Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear deal last year and began applying pressure on Tehran through economic sanctions.Trump tweeted that other countries, including China and Japan, should protect their own oil tankers in the Middle East. “Why are we protecting the shipping lanes for other countries … for zero compensation,” he wrote. “All of these countries should be protecting their own ships on what has always been a dangerous journey.”Meanwhile, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, met Saudi Arabia’s king and crown prince for talks on Monday as the US sought to promote an anti-Iran alliance.“You are a dear friend,” King Salman told Pompeo, who was due to fly to the United Arab Emirates later on Monday for further discussions.Iran has said it will not enter into discussions until sanctions are lifted. The fresh round of US sanctions is however an attempt to force the Iranian leadership to hold talks with the US. A near-total ban on oil exports is already in place.A drone strike on an airport in Saudi Arabia by Iranian-aligned Houthi rebels, which left one person dead and 21 injured, will have coloured the mood among Gulf states. It follows another attack on 12 June.Hook is also to meet officials from Britain, France and Germany this week, but declined to say what pressure he will putting on those countries to follow the US out of the nuclear deal with Iran if, as Tehran has threatened, it breaches its permitted uranium enrichment stock levels on Thursday.The EU has the choice of either putting the issue in the nuclear deal dispute mechanism, or threatening its own retaliatory measures.Germany appeared cool towards US talk of building a global coalition against Iran. A foreign ministry spokesman said on Monday that Berlin had “taken note via the media” of Pompeo’s comments and added that “our top aim is and remains a de-escalation of the serious situation”.Hook claimed the EU was being subjected to nuclear blackmail by Iran, and claimed Iran had rejected the opportunity to take various diplomatic “off-ramps” in the past year.The UK, together with France and Germany, is urging Tehran to wait for European countries to set up the much-delayed financial mechanism designed to help businesses in Europe trade with Iran, circumventing secondary US sanctions. Iran saw an increase in trade as one of the key benefits of the deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f423eac20418020498f4959425538dba58df37f3/0_172_5392_3236/master/5392.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9788ec3edf22d96c12f0d01f392bc30","title":"sanders student loan debt plan","story":"Democratic presidential candidate proposes to pay for plan, which would cost $2.2tn over next decade, through a tax on Wall Street Bernie Sanders on Monday introduced legislation to eliminate the entire $1.6tn in student loan debt owed by 45 million Americans.The Vermont senator announced the move as he vies for the Democratic presidential nomination in a primary contest marked by sweeping economic proposals.This initiative builds on Sanders’ previous higher education plan, and would make two- and four-year public colleges and universities tuition-free and debt-free. The plan would cost $2.2tn over the next decade, a figure Sanders proposes to pay through a tax on Wall Street.“This is truly a revolutionary proposal which accomplishes three major goals,” Sanders said in Washington on Monday.“In a highly competitive global economy, it makes certain that all Americans, regardless of income, can get the college education or job training they need to secure decent-paying jobs by making public colleges, universities and trade schools tuition-free and debt-free.”Sanders was joined in his new effort by congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Pramila Jayapal, who have introduced parallel legislation in the House.“Free college tuition” was a hallmark of Sanders’ insurgent campaign for the Democratic nomination against Hillary Clinton in 2016 and it remains a priority as he faces increasingly tough competition from his closest ideological rival, Elizabeth Warren.Sanders’ plan is decidedly more ambitious than the one introduced by the Massachusetts senator, who has built momentum in the primary race by steadily introducing new policy ideas.Warren’s plan would cancel most student loan debt and also eliminate undergraduate tuition at public colleges and universities. Under the Warren plan, $50,000 in student loan debt would be eliminated for every person with a household income of less than $100,000.The issue of student debt and the cost of college has become central and contested in the Democratic primary, with most leading candidates addressing it in some form. Sanders and Warren have presented by far the most detailed proposals.As the first Democratic debates approach, Warren has closed the gap on Sanders in national and state polling. Former vice-president Joe Biden leads most polls from the ideological center, with Sanders in second and Warren in third as the leading voices of the progressive wing of the party, ahead of the South Bend, Indiana, mayor, Pete Buttigieg, and California senator Kamala Harris.Warren and Sanders will not face each other onstage in this week’s debates in Miami, for which the sprawling Democratic field has been split into two. Warren will appear on Wednesday and Sanders on Thursday. The Vermont senator will face more top-rank opposition, with Biden, Buttigieg and Harris in his half of the draw."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66809d57c2f22abda940ddcf0dffd69eee82fac7/393_302_3417_2051/master/3417.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=709a21c6af5a056c901aafaac976aa47","title":"saudi arabia khashoggi pompeo doesnt raise during meeting","story":"Unnamed senior state department official travelling with Pompeo said the subject of the killing did not come upThe US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, did not discuss the murder of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in a meeting with the Saudi king, it has been reported, in the latest sign the Trump administration is trying to drop the subject.Pompeo said in a tweet that he had had a “productive meeting” with King Salman “to discuss heightened tensions in the region and the need to promote maritime security in the strait of Hormuz”.“Freedom of navigation is paramount,” he said. Asked about the slaughter and dismemberment of Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident, in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last October, an unnamed senior state department official travelling with Pompeo told Reuters news agency the subject did not come up.In an interview broadcast on Sunday, Donald Trump said he had talked to the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, on Friday but the Khashoggi murder “really didn’t come up in that discussion”.The president sought to deflect further questions about the killing, saying Iran killed more people and pointing to Saudi spending on US weapons and other goods.“They spend $400 to $450bn over a period of time, all money, all jobs, buying equipment,” Trump told NBC News. “And by the way, if they don’t do business with us, you know what they do? They’ll do business with the Russians or with the Chinese.”The official line put out by administration officials in routine briefings is that those responsible for murdering Khashoggi must be held to account, and that investigations are continuing.A report issued earlier this month by the special UN investigator, Agnès Callamard, said there was “credible evidence” that Saudi crown prince bore responsibility for the murder.Her report also found that the Saudi and Turkish investigations into the murder failed to meet international standards and the Saudi inquiry in particular was conducted in such bad faith it could amount to act of obstruction.

Gone are the days when couples would be satisfied with a single black and white photo to commemorate their weddingChinese couples used to be satisfied with a single black and white photograph taken on their wedding as a memento of their special day. But times have changed dramatically, and the wedding photographs, especially pre-wedding photo sessions, have become big business in China.In the main touristic spots in different cities across China, it is easy to see couples having their pre-wedding photoshoots, which become the must-have for every Chinese couple before their marriage. Unlike western weddings, where couples usually have their photos taken on their wedding day, for Chinese people it is quite popular to have their day-long photo sessions way before their actual weddings. Sometimes it can be half a year or even a year in advance of the ceremony.Some couples even choose other countries for their pre-wedding sessions. Often for their photoshoots couples go for traditionally romantic cities such as Paris.Those who can’t afford such a trip to have pre-wedding photos with the Eiffel Tower can have their photo taken in front of Chinese replicas of the main world’s tourist sites.Other couples prefer more traditional outdoor locations, like Beijing’s Hutong neighbourhood, or to be surrounded by nature like in Dali, where lots of couples do their pre-wedding photography next to Lake Erhai.These sessions can range in price from a few hundred up to thousands of dollars, with companies providing clients with everything from outfits to makeup and transportation. Brides typically have at least three dress changes per shoot. Inspired by the traditional western style, many choose a flowing white wedding dress, a Chinese-style red gown, and something more modern.The shoots are just one part of a booming industry in China. A wedding for most newly married couples can run from 50,000 yuan (£5,700) to 200,000 yuan, with larger amounts not uncommon in big cities like Beijing or Shanghai. China’s wedding industry was valued at 1.46tn yuan in 2017, and it is expected to grow to 3tn yuan by 2021."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3930872.1560956010!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ryanair has nothing further to add airline refunds hard to come by","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDue to weather conditions, the Ryanair flight landed at Dublin Airport instead of Shannon.  Photograph: ReutersPaul HannaFile PhotoWe don’t often have cause to revisit stories that we feature on this page but, for reasons that will no doubt become apparent, we feel compelled to do just that this week. It has to do with Ryanair and it is disturbing on a couple of levels.On Friday, April 26th, a reader by the name of Adrian Gordon and his wife took a flight from Malaga airport to Shannon Airport. Due to weather conditions, passengers were advised by the pilot as their plane began to land that they were landing at Dublin Airport instead of Shannon.All passengers were told to go to the Ryanair desk at the airport so transport to Shannon could be arranged.The plane duly landed at Dublin Airport shortly after midnight and, as instructed, Adrian went to the Ryanair desk where he was told that because a lot of flights had to be erted from both Shannon and Cork Airports there were no more buses available.He was told to hire a car or get a taxi to Shannon and that Ryanair would refund him the cost within seven days.As it happened, Adrian did not have his driving licence with him so he and his wife had no option but to hire a taxi from Dublin to Shannon Airport at a cost of €440.80. When he got home he sent a claim to the airline.However, despite the promise made by crew on the ground in Dublin, the airline refused to refund the cost of the taxi and instead it insisted “that surface transportation was arranged by them for all passengers”.So Adrian contacted us on May 3rd and we immediately contacted Ryanair after which we received a distinctly terse statement which said simply: “We’ve resolved this directly with the customer.”Now we could have left it there but we decided to check with “the customer” and we got in touch with Adrian again.He told us that he had indeed received a call from a representative of the airline and had been told that a refund would be with him in a matter of days. Happy days, we thought.But no. Weeks past and no refund came.Same flight, other complaintsIn the meantime other complaints about the same flight started coming in to the Pricewatch desk.Barth’s wife “queried as to whether that meant we should organise our own taxi or car rental and the Ryanair representative said yes. To ensure that there was no misunderstanding, my wife again queried as to whether it was definitely acceptable to organise alternative transport to our original destination and queried as to how we would be refunded for same. The Ryanair representative clarified that this was acceptable and that an application for a refund for same could be made through the Ryanair website.”So the couple hired a car. They even gave another group a lift to Shannon – an act which would have saved the airline the expense. But then when Barth went to claim the money from the airline, he received a mail which said: “Operations Department has confirmed that surface transportation was organised for all customers to their original destination and as such we are not liable for any alternative transportation costs you may have incurred.”Then there was Colm McEnery. He had no choice but to hire a car at a cost of €301.60. Like Barth, he gave a group of other passengers on the plane a lift to Shannon – saving Ryanair money. But his claim was also refused by RyanairPeter McCarthy was on the same flight as was Claire Sloan and Diana Fahey. Like all the others they were told by Ryanair that “Our Operations Department has confirmed that surface transportation was organised for all customers to their original destination and as such we are not liable for any alternative transportation costs you may have incurred.”Untrue statementThis claim, which had been made repeatedly by Ryanair when affected passengers tried to claim back expenses incurred, was clearly untrue.Now, back to Adrian Gordon, the first person to contact us.As you will recall, when we contacted Ryanair in early May we were told that it had “resolved this directly with the customer”.But that was not actually true either. Over the weeks that followed, in spite of the claim by the airline, the refund Adrian was told was on the way never materialised – he contacted us several times with updates.So at the end of the month we got back on to Ryanair and asked why it had not honoured the commitment it had made to Adrian.While we were at it we also sent details of the other passengers’ complaints to the airline. And once again the airline said, “We’ve resolved this directly with the customers.”This was a line we were growing used to hearing. So we kept at it and then on June 11th – almost six weeks after the airline had claimed to have resolved the issue with Adrian and after we had interceded twice on his behalf – he got in touch to say he had finally got his refund.We have also followed up with the other passengers and they too have been refunded.But all of this raises an important point. Every one of these passengers were told at the airport they could hire a car or get a taxi from Dublin to Shannon because there was no buses available. Yet all of them were told subsequently by the airline that its “Operations Department has confirmed that surface transportation was organised for all customers to their original destination and as such we are not liable for any alternative transportation costs you may have incurred.”That claim made by Ryanair in its rejection letter was clearly not true.So last week we got back on to the airline and asked why its email correspondence with these passengers made a claim that was clearly untrue. We also asked if there were other cases of it responding to its passengers looking for expenses incurred or money back with similarly untrue claims.We received the following statement: “This flight from Malaga to Shannon (26 April) erted to Dublin due to unfavourable weather conditions at Shannon Airport. Ground transportation was organised from Dublin to Shannon but not all customers were accommodated on the bus transfers. We have been in contact with these customers directly.”Keen eyed readers will notice that this response did not really address the questions we had put to the airline so we tried again. We asked why the initial correspondence had contained a claim that was untrue and asked if it was aware of other instances when its correspondence had misled passengers looking for money they were entitled to back.“Ryanair has nothing further to add,” was all that came back in response."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3935165.1561324245!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gynaecologist performed exploratory work without consent","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tObstetrician and gynaecologist Prof Ray O’Sullivan says he did not feel he needed to obtain consent before carrying out tests on five women patients last year. Photograph: Anthony DevlinPAA report into the failure of a senior hospital consultant at St Luke’s Hospital, Kilkenny, to obtain consent before carrying out gynaecological “exploratory work” on women patients is under consideration by Ireland East Hospital Group.Obstetrician and gynaecologist Prof Ray O’Sullivan says he did not feel he needed to obtain consent before carrying out tests on five women patients last year. The hospital maintains he should have obtained consent, has sought his suspension and has reported the matter to the Medical Council. The tests were stopped last September after nursing staff raised concerns over whether the required consents had been obtained from a regional hospital ethical committee and from the patients themselves.The tests, which were carried out by junior staff unaware there was an issue with consent, involved flushing the vaginas of the women with water, inserting a miniature scope for monitoring, and measuring the pressure within the vagina. The equipment involved, including tubes and pressure gauges, was brought in from outside the hospital.Investigation of symptomsThe women involved had been referred to the hospital for investigation of their symptoms.Speaking to The , Prof O’Sullivan said the issue “had more to do with preliminary, exploratory work – as to whether you need consent for that before you engage in an actual clinical trial. It was more technical than anything else.”Asked if he felt he needed consent, he replied: “I felt I didn’t need consent. I didn’t because we weren’t actually doing the research. We were just seeing if a particular procedure that we were planning on doing as part of the research could be done.”Tests stoppedOnce the issue became know, the hospital stopped the tests and informed the patients, who were told investigations into the matter would be completed within weeks.The hospital commissioned a report from Prof Peter Doran, a scientist at UCD’s school of medicine, which was critical of the failure to secure consent.Ireland East Hospital Group then commissioned a second report. Prof O’Sullivan said he was sure that report would say “that’s fine, fire ahead with the research but just get the ethical approval going forward for the actual research”.A spokeswoman for the hospital group said its chief executive Mary Day had “only received the report on Friday and hasn’t had a chance to review it”.Asked whether an apology would be made to the women affected, she replied she had “nothing further to say”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Women\u0026rsquos council calls for State survey into sexual violence to include analysis of dating appsMark Menezes says Ireland should switch to liquified natural gas (LNG) and nuclearPlanned strike by 10,000 support staff to have significant impact on services, says HSE\u0026lsquoI\u0026rsquom trying all day to be strong for our children.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillSome respite from the cold, wet summer to date is expected this week with sunshine forecast to break through and temperatures set to rise as high as 27 degrees.The hot weather comes in the wake of heavy rain which hit the country on Sunday and Monday, with accumulations of 25-40mm recorded in some areas.A bathing prohibition notice was put in place at Dollymount beach on Monday due to a stormwater overflow from Ringsend wastewater treatment plan linked to the heavy rainfall.Irish Water said the overflow “operated in compliance with plant design and regulations, and was fully screened and settled”.The bathing ban was announced following consultation with the HSE, and will remain in place pending water testing by Dublin City Council.Irish Water added bathing prohibitions were already in place for the entire 2019 bathing season at Sandymount and Merrion beaches due to general water quality issues, unrelated to the Ringsend plant. There will be scattered showers on Tuesday, some of which could be heavy, but sunshine is forecast and temperatures should rise towards 23 degrees, according to the forecasters. Temperatures on Wednesday are to range between 19 and 24 degrees in general, but conditions could be a bit cooler in the north and northwest due to breezy conditions.The best of the weather is due to come on Thursday, which Met Éireann expects to be a “warm and sunny day for most of the country with highs of 20 to 27 degrees”. The highest chance of rain is to be along the southwest coast. The warm conditions are due to carry through to Friday, with temperatures to range from 20 to 26 degrees and a chance of “the odd shower”.The weather is expected to become “much fresher” on Saturday and there may well be a return for the “heavy and thundery” rain seen in recent days. Sunday will be a cooler day nationwide.HeatwaveAs people across Ireland debate putting away their umbrellas for a few days, France is bracing for a “potentially dangerous” heatwave that could see record temperatures for June. Authorities in Paris are setting up “cool rooms” in municipal buildings, opening pools for late-night swimming and installing extra drinking fountains in response to the mercury being forecast to surpass 40 degrees.The heatwave, which is also expected to engulf Spain, Germany, Switzerland and Belgium, is reviving memories in France of August 2003, when searing temperatures overwhelmed hospitals and caused the deaths of an estimated 15,000 people, most of whom were elderly.The current record temperature in France for June stands at 41.5 degrees, registered near Narbonne in the south in June 2003.“We could see temperatures in localised areas hit record highs,” Meteo France said. “This heatwave could be remarkable for how early it has come as well as its intensity.”Relatively high humidity levels mean it will feel more like 47 degrees, the AccuWeather website said.Farmers in France are worried about damage to crops and water restrictions, including for irrigation, are currently in place in a fifth of mainland France’s 96 administrative departments. The electricity grid is also expected to come under pressure as air conditioners and fans are called into action during the heatwave.

File photograph: Stoyan NenovReuters A common food safety and animal health area covering Britain and Ireland could help to keep the Border open without the backstop after Brexit, a group of politicians, academics and trade experts has proposed. The Alternative Arrangements Commission also proposes special economic zones (SEZ) for the Donegal-Derry and Newry-Dundalk corridors and trusted trader schemes and exemptions to ease customs arrangements. A privately funded initiative, the commission is dominated by hard Brexiteers but chaired by Conservative MPs Greg Hands and Nicky Morgan, who backed Remain in the 2016 referendum. At the publication of its interim report in London on Monday, the chairman of the commission’s technical panel, Shanker Singham, said the joint British-Irish sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) area would initially be fully aligned with EU regulations. If Britain wanted to erge from EU rules in the future, Ireland could withdraw from the joint SPS area and Northern Ireland could choose whether to remain aligned with Britain or join Ireland in remaining in the EU’s regulatory system. “It defers the decision about when you might lock into whose regulatory system to the point at which it becomes relevant, which is I think politically a very important element of this,” he said. Independent trade policyMr Singham acknowledged that Britain could instead seek to enter the entire UK into the EU’s SPS regulatory system, as Switzerland and Norway have done. But he said a fully independent trade policy was necessary to compensate for the inevitable disruptions caused by Brexit.“The only benefits of Brexit are an independent trade and regulatory policy, the only economic benefits. So you have to retain those to overcome the disruptions. That’s just the hard reality of Brexit,” he said. The report argues that the World Trade Organisation’s frontier traffic and national security exemptions could be used to justify the establishment of SEZs in the Derry-Donegal and Dundalk-Newry corridors. These zones would be treated as single economic areas with no checks or tariffs, but Mr Singham acknowledged that the borders of each SEZ would have to be policed. ‘Special economic zone’“There obviously would be checks outside the special economic zone, just as there were at Shannon, which was the oldest special economic zone in the world while it existed in Ireland,” he said. The Irish Government did not co-operate with the commission, which will publish its final report next month along with an alternative arrangements protocol its supporters hope could replace the backstop or sit alongside it in the Withdrawal Agreement. Business representatives at Monday’s event were sceptical about the commission’s proposals for customs facilitation and Neil McDonnell, chief executive of Isme, warned that the added costs could drive small firms out of business.“It’s not that any of this stuff isn’t doable or feasible in the long run, it’s that if you attempt to do this stuff in a big bang it will have an impact,” he said. “The Higgs boson was posited in 1964 but no one could prove it was there until 2012 – so 48 years to prove something that a Brit said was around in 1964. But we did have to build the Large Hadron Collider to get there, so you just want to keep it simple.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

If it was an Islamic state, I wouldn\u0027t have left.The main reasons I left the so-called Islamic State is because they started to kill people I know them personally that are Muslims.I had a group of about 20 friends that all left the so-called Islamic State. They all left at one time. One by one, they started to kill them.Jack Letts in Raqqa, SyriaLetts said that he was caught as he tried to escape the border into Turkey after expecting safe passage through Al Nusra-Front territory.He said: They would help us leave. They would get us a smuggler. Nusra Front not great guys, but they\u0027re a lot more trustworthy than the Free Syrian Army.Letts\u0027 commented on his mental heath, claiming that he was diagnosed with Tourette\u0027s and severe obsessive compulsive disorder.The convert left his middle-class home in Oxford to become one of IS\u0027 most notorious recruits before his eventual capture.Now, after languishing in prison for two years, Letts said that he regretted becoming the poster boy for Islamic extremism.He said: That\u0027s one of the things that I regret I realised that me coming had a lot more meaning than a Syrian becoming ISIS.Jack Letts in Kurdish jailSpeaking about his time in solitary confinement, he said: You wouldn\u0027t be able to sit with me like this.

A report by the London School of Economics (LSE) into children’s attitudes towards the internet found they overwhelmingly wanted a ‘grand erasure’ of their online footprint to stop childhood mistakes affecting their future.The research, which was funded by the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office, also found that children were generally trusting of tech companies in the same way they are of their schools.LSE researchers reviewed more than a decade’s worth of studies into children’s understanding of their online data and also conducted focus groups with more than 160 secondary school-age children.Professor Sonia Livingstone, who led the research, said children were generally “outraged” when they learned how much of their personal information is being hoarded online and wanted “a fresh start” when they turned 18.She said: “They say ‘whatever I do before I am 18 should be wiped off’ as it shouldn’t have any effect on them as an adult. They want a kind of grand erasure because they talk about the importance of making mistakes and just being kids trying things out.”The Government is currently looking at a range of new measures to better protect children online including imposing a legal duty of care on tech giants and introducing an Age Appropriate Design Code, which will mean social media giants will have to assume users are children if they can\u0027t age verify them.Duty of Care white paperMost social media companies have a minimum age of 13, but due to the lack of proper age checks the study found children as young as nine said they had profiles.The study found that children generally took instructions they received online on “face value” and often didn’t understand how tech companies were commercially benefiting from the information they handed over. As a result, they found it “puzzling” that internet companies often asked them to give out details they did not see as relevant to the service.The children interviewed were also shocked to learn that material they thought they had deleted could still exist online and wanted “delete to mean delete” when it came to social media.Other features children wanted from tech companies were a way to see which other companies their details had been shared with and “child-friendly mechanisms” to edit their information.Prof Livingstone said the children were generally mystified as to why tech companies were interested in personal information they saw as quickly going out of date as they grew up.She added: “Creepy is a really common word that they use. It’s creepy and sinister that all that data is being kept.”Duty of Care CampaignComment: Brexit will be someone else’s problem soon.

Wangige is hardly Helmand, nor, by his own admission, did counterinsurgency work particularly well in either Afghanistan or Iraq.Ex-major Wayne Hennessy-Barrett, 46, served in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo and Iraq before founding 4G in 2013 in KenyaYet the traditional “microfinance” model of lending to the poor was not working either, Mr Hennessy-Barrett reckoned. Once a buzzword in development circles, microfinance has been hailed by its proponents as a powerful tool in fighting poverty. Tony Blair and Bill Clinton were both fans.The idea was simple enough. Many poor people in the developing world eke out a living as petty traders, but rarely have access to the credit needed to grow their businesses.Microfinance was meant to give them that access through  small loans and low-cost banking services, setting them on the path to self-sufficiency. The model has gone global in recent decades: more than 200m people round the world have been the recipients of “microcredit”.The miracle has largely failed to happen, however. While disagreements about the impact of microfinance abound, studies have suggested that the model has largely failed to lift the poor out of poverty. Many, indeed, have been left worse off because they have been plunged into debt.Mr Hennessy-Barrett reckons the problem largely lies with the model used by most microfinanciers. To keep overheads down, many companies lend through mobile phone apps and have little interaction with their clients or knowledge of what the money is going to be spent on.Wayne Hennessy-Barrett at a market in WangigeOften cash is borrowed to cover unexpected crises, such as funerals and medical operations. Reflecting a growing problem in Kenya, loans to cover online gambling are also increasing, according to government officials.Lacking a sufficient or regular enough income to pay back the loans, many default. More than one million people have been blacklisted by the country’s two main credit ratings, sometimes over loans of less than £5.Credit alone, Mr Hennessy-Barrett realised, was likely to do more harm than good. Only if people borrowed sensibly, and understood how to turn loans into larger incomes, would they have a chance of escaping poverty rather than being sucked deeper into it.“Just shoving money at people is not enough,” he said. “Having a loan to solve a problem is not enough. What you need is a livelihood where you can use credit for leverage. When it it just to live it is a recipe for poverty.“Cheap debt pushed carelessly at poor people keeps poor people poor.”Valentine Nasila, Operations Manager at 4G Capital\u0026#39s head office, speaks with a clientThere was no question in his mind that microcredit was still the key to fighting poverty. In a country where formal jobs are few and far between, three in four working Kenyans are self-employed, scratching a living by selling goods to other poor people.Yet if poor borrowers were to have a chance of success, he concluded, they would need much more face-to-face support from trained professionals who understood the needs and challenges of their clients.It was in attempting to meet this need that Mr Hennessy-Barrett drew on his army experience. In Afghanistan, the British army’s counterinsurgency operations were designed to deny insurgents ground by protecting communities, creating the conditions to let them live normal lives and speaking to people to understand their needs and reassure them.Such skills could also be deployed in peacetime environments, he felt. From the time of its foundation in a small office in Wangige in 2013, his company, 4G Capital, would run along army lines.Wayne Hennessy-Barrett\u0026#39s business is one of Africa’s fastest growing financial technology companies“In Afghanistan we had several teams of elite soldiers operating in multiple places, communing with the population, trying to understand their needs,” he said.“That led to a methodology of having small teams of well-trained, dedicated professionals.”From the outset, Mr Hennessy-Barrett deployed his staff in teams of four and sent them to trawl through the markets using his own interpretation of the army’s “patrol trinity”.In counterinsurgency terms, this meant “intelligence gathering”, “framework protection” and “local assurance”. For 4G, this was reinterpreted as “marketing”, “lending” and “growth and repayment”. Teams would seek to understand the environment they were operating in, lend to iniduals after learning what their needs were and finally helping them to grow their businesses so they could repay their loans.The loans on offer were small, between £40 and £400, and had to be repaid within a month, the intention being to enforce discipline and focus money where it was needed: replenishing inventory, adding stock and growing businesses.Crucially, it also came with basic training, teaching clients how to maximise growth potential, keep books and improve customer care. The mixture of personal attention and computer algorithms to assess the viability of clients’ growth potential means that 92 percent of loans are paid on time, meaning the company has more money to lend.The model appears to have been phenomenally successful. From its original outlet in Wangige, 4G Capital now has 70 more, with more than 300 employees. Expanding into Rwanda and Uganda, it is one of Africa’s fastest growing financial technology companies. It expects to lend £47 million over the next 12 months.Optometrist Tabitha Njeri, 26, borrowed £80 from 4G Capital to start her own optician\u0026#39s storeThe success, Mr Hennessy-Barrett says, has come from “slaving” the company’s fortunes to the fortunes of its clients. It is doing well because its clients have seen their businesses grow on average by 82 per cent since taking their first loan from 4G.Tabitha Njeri, who runs a small optician’s shop in Wangige, is one such beneficiary. 4G lent her £80 towards her startup costs early last year, gave her training in accountancy and business growth skills and rolled over loans to allow her to increase stock from 50 to 150 glasses. She now plans to expand by opening a diagnosis lab.“I used to find it very difficult to raise enough to support my family,” she said. “Now I can. I have financial stability.”Down the road, Patrick Ngore, who runs a chemist’s, says he has been able to increase stock sevenfold with loans from the company. He also credits training in stock management and minimising expenditure in growing his profit margins from 20 to 40 per cent.Others in Wangige tell similar stories.In many ways, the 4G model, although partially reliant on technology,  is a return to the basics of microfinance. Loans have allowed Patrick Ngore, owner of a chemists,to increase his stock sevenfold and boost his profit margin from 20 per cent to 40 per centThe founder of modern microfinance is generally held to be Mohammed Yunus, who started making small loans to the very poor in Bangladesh in 1976. Lending mostly to women, who formed small groups that were collectively responsible for each other’s debts, he found that astonishingly few defaulted.His Grameen Bank has now made more than £7 billion pounds in small loans to the poor, an achievement that secured him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006.Yet the microfinance model he pioneered would grow increasingly troubled. Irresponsible and often predatory lending to the poor led to debt crises in Bosnia, Morocco and parts of Pakistan. It also contributed to a debtors’ revolt in Nicaragua in 2008 when farmers, backed by President Daniel Ortega, refused en masse to pay back microcredit loans. A microfinance default crisis in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh two years later was blamed for a surge in suicide by farmers.Geoffrey Kamanu runs through a finance training programme with staff from 4G Capital The longstanding problem with microfinance, which is largely driven by private companies like 4G, is that business logic often leads to aggressive tactics in collecting debts, says David Roodman, author of the book Due Diligence: An Impertinent Inquiry into Microfinance.In countries like Kenya many microfinance outfits lend at interest rates as high as 30 per cent because they are forced to raise capital from commercial banks, often placing an intolerable burden on poor borrowers.Mr Hennessy-Barrett says his model is addressing those concerns: interest rates are capped at 13.5 per cent and allowances are made for “bad-luck customers” who encounter unexpected setbacks like illness or a death in the family.Experts in Kenya generally applaud 4G Capital’s model, which has been mimicked by one or two other outfits. But they also raise questions about what impact it can really have.Microcredit | Transforming fortunes and futures in NepalDespite its growth, 4G and its 120,000 customers are still pretty small fry, says Paul Musoke, director of financial institutions at FSD Africa, a UK-funded organisation that looks at ways to financially empower the poor.By contrast, M-Shwari and Tala, two providers of small loans through mobile phone apps, have 11 million between them in Kenya alone. Such “light-touch” models, which use technology rather than people to engage with borrowers are always likely to do better than “heavy-touch” approaches like Mr Hennessy-Barrett’s — except in densely populated countries like Bangladesh.“It makes sense what he is trying to do,” says Mr Musoke. “The question is whether it can be scaled up significantly to make an impact.”The other danger in Kenya is that a microfinance “debt bubble” risks being created because, in a poorly regulated market, there is little to stop poor borrowers from taking loans from 4G and other companies offering unsecured credit at the same time.Microfinancing: revolutionising the health and livelihoods of Nepalese women“The greatest potential for harm has come when you have multiple lenders all growing at once because then almost certainly people are borrowing from one to pay the other,” says Mr Roodman.Mr Hennessy-Barrett’s model seems enlightened, yet it is too soon to tell how effective it will be. History suggests that microcredit often stimulates start-up businesses, but ultimately fails to enrich its owners, becoming more a tool helping to manage poverty than to reduce it. Mr Roodman likens it to a prescription drug “useful in moderation but dangerous in large doses”.While it may not be a panacea, microfinance has given people more choice, whatever the overall risks. If Mr Hennessy-Barrett can tweak a flawed model and encourage others to follow suit, he could yet prove as successful pioneer as Mohammed Yunus.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Banks and FinanceComment: Brexit will be someone else’s problem soon.

Why is (carrying alcohol) now a problem? I don\u0027t believe society has changed that much.There\u0027s an awful lot of people who are a bit shocked that they could be caught out. They\u0027re shocked that they won\u0027t be able to bring back a couple of bottles of nice wine from Paris or some fascinating Belgian beers from Brussels.He added: It\u0027s going to be inconvenient for a lot of passengers. It might not affect businessmen travelling first class who get (served) wine anyway, but it\u0027s going to be a pain in the neck.I think air travel is a bit of a pain in the neck a lot of the time and we need a bit of respite.A spokesman for Eurostar said its luggage policy was updated last autumn to maintain a pleasant environment on board for all our travellers.Passengers who want to transport prohibited alcohol are advised to use the firm\u0027s luggage service, which charges a minimum fee of £30 per item.Comment: Brexit will be someone else’s problem soon.

Recovery of the species has been hindered by habitat loss, pollution and the introduction of diseases. Natural replenishment of their native grounds is so limited that human intervention is their only hope.Scientists have begun to lay an oyster bed in the depths of the Thames estuary in Essex, using recycled shells from oysters bred in Mersea and sold in Borough Market, as well as cockleshells from the Thames cockle fleet. Native oysters in Whitstable, KentSoon, adult female oysters, or mother oysters, will be laid, and it is hoped they will quickly spawn.Oyster farming has been recorded in Mersea since Roman times, with the shellfish forming a staple part of the British diet throughout history.  Many of London\u0027s famous oyster bars sprung up largely because of the fruits of the Thames.The project is not only good news for British seafood lovers oysters are very useful for an aquatic ecosystem as they create the conditions for other species to thrive – stabilising shorelines, filtering water and providing vital food and habitat for coastal wildlife. One adult oyster, for example, can filter more than 140 litres of water in a single day. ZSL’s Senior Conservation Programme Manager for UK \u0026amp Europe, Alison Debney, said: “It may not be glamorous work, but laying ‘mother oysters’ at the right time is vital to the success of the restoration programme, and therefore vital for the survival of this native British species.“The coalition has since moved more than 25,000 native oysters to Essex estuaries, as well as ensuring that fishing in the area is prohibited until the oyster stocks have sufficiently recovered and are able to withstand sustainable harvesting.”Dr Rebecca Korda, Senior Marine Advisor at Natural England explained: “We are thrilled to be part of this collaboration which sees an array of stakeholders coming together and showing incredible innovation and drive to work to restore the native oyster and the native oyster beds back to the Essex waters. This is a hugely exciting and important step in taking this work forward and we are delighted to continue to support and contribute to the project”.Comment: Brexit will be someone else’s problem soon.

If you pay them cash directly they will come back as they\u0027ll think you\u0027re a soft touch.”The club confirmed that threats were made by travellers to senior officials before they approached police.We have had conversations with them and they asked for £1,500, and have made idle threats,” Mr Rowe said.Exeter Chiefs refused to pay the ransom and were able to evict the travellers within 24 hours of their arrival with an enforcement order granted from a company in the Midlands.The travellers have since left the site in Exeter, Devon, but security staff have remained there because of aggressive threats to return to the site.It is believed that the same group have relocated to private land nearby and had been evicted from another site close by on Friday.Mr Rowe said: They were a bit aggressive and threatening when they left as we chucked them off so quickly and they threatened to come back.Considering they were only on site for less than 24 hours they left a ton of mess which we have cleared up. What they left was disgusting.Comment: Brexit will be someone else’s problem soon.

The scale of the victory was far larger than the 13,000 vote margin he won in March.  Mr Erdoğan appeared to immediately accept the defeat and tweeted his congratulations to Mr Imamoğlu. Opposition supporters celebrate in Istanbul“Everyone who believes in democracy is proud of Turkey today. The whole world, who believe in democracy, is proud of Turkey,” said Kemal Kiloçdaroğlu, the leader of the CHP. “I don’t want anyone to feel sad. Do not forget, today the victor is democracy.” Mr Kiloçdaroğlu said his party was “now the party of the 82 million”, meaning it represented the entire population of Turkey. “The CHP will not marginalize anyone, will respect their religion, ethnicity or social identity.”While the victory in Istanbul may have galvanised the CHP, it is not clear the party has many avenues to immediately direct its newfound political energy. Turkish voters have gone to the polls every year since 2017 in a rapid succession of votes including a constitutional referendum, a national election, and this year’s local election. However, Turkey now has no elections scheduled until 2023. That gives Mr Erdoğan time to regroup politically while waiting for the energy generated by the CHP’s Istanbul victory to dissipate. Analysts said the Istanbul result still represented a major setback for Mr Erdogan and his decision to force a re-run of the March election will go down as a serious miscalculation by the Turkish president. Mr Erdogan appears to have miscalculated by forcing a re-run of the election“President and AKP chairman Recep Tayyip Erdoğan will sure have to think over the main reasons for this defeat in Istanbul, twice in less than three months,” said Serkan Demirtas, a columnist with the Hurriyet newspaper. “Istanbul, with its more than 10 million voters, represents one-fifth of the entire Turkey, and any growing political trend in this city would resonate in the rest of the country.”Mr Erdoğan hoped to use the next four years to consolidate his own power and reassure investors, who have balked at Turkey’s political instability and his own authoritarian rule. However, the Moody’s rating agency cut Turkey’s sovereign credit rating even further this month out of concern over a potential government default. The US has also threatened to bring sanctions against Turkey over its plans to deploy a Russian-made S-400 missile defence system, which Washington says is incompatible with Turkey’s commitments as a Nato ally. Sanctions could further dent Turkey’s already weakened economy. Mr Erdoğan is likely to meet Donald Trump at a G20 summit in Japan this weekend, the first time the two men have met face-to-face since the S-400 standoff intensified. Comment: Brexit will be someone else’s problem soon.

Hope Not Hate called on the two leadership contenders to “publicly and unambiguously” commit to tackle the issue, including by establishing an independent body to investigate Islamophobia in the party and increasing transparency in disciplinary procedures.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He was a lifelong “better off outer”, they said, who tempered his views during the referendum but then prevented Labour from opposing Brexit – thus ceding ground and millions of votes to the Liberal Democrats, Greens and nationalists. This is probably too simple. It seems more likely that Corbyn was always most interested in gaining power, but had a different view of the right way to go about it. Immediately after the referendum, for example, most Labour people thought it was right to accept the result and to press for a soft Brexit. And in the 2017 election, Labour’s policy of a “jobs-first Brexit”, combined with opposition to a no-deal exit, was no obstacle to a stunning electoral performance that deprived Theresa May of her majority.It was only last year – when The Independent started to campaign for a Final Say referendum – that Corbyn’s attempt to straddle Leave and Remain started to cause strains in the party. Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Steph Houghton celebrates with teammates after scoring England\u0027s first goal during the Women\u0027s World Cup round of 16 match against Cameroon at the Stade du Hainaut stadium in Valenciennes, FrancePride marchers at a rally outside the Scottish Parliament in EdinburghThe sun rises between the stones and over crowds at Stonehenge where people gather to celebrate the dawn of the longest day in the UK.

Labour did badly in the European elections, and yet managed to hold Peterborough in the by-election against a strong Brexit Party challenge. The New Statesman reports that one analysis prepared for the shadow cabinet suggested that Labour is losing votes in a 2:1:1 ratio to the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and the Brexit Party. In other words, for every one it loses to the Brexit Party, it loses three to the Remain parties. This suggests that Labour should take up a more explicitly Remain position – which is what Corbyn is now cautiously doing, although his Remainer critics will say it is too little, too late, and still allows the Lib Dems and the Greens to outflank the party on the pro-EU side. But Corbyn’s Leaver critics – the 26 MPs who signed a letter to him today opposing a new referendum – say that he risks the worst of both worlds: losing Leave voters on one side while failing to win Remain voters back on the other. This split is represented at the top of the party, with Ian Lavery, the party chair, posting an angry tweet this morning – which was presumably meant to be a private message – saying that the position of the shadow cabinet supporters of a referendum “really is to head for revoking Article 50”. On the other side, Emily Thornberry’s public support for a referendum exceeded the bounds of party policy, prompting Corbyn to demote her from her role deputising for him in the Commons (sending her to “re-education camp”, as the prime minister put it). She continued to press her case at the shadow cabinet meeting today. What is interesting is that Keir Starmer, assumed to be the leading organiser of Labour’s shift of position, has been less outspoken. Yet he has been drafting and redrafting the words of the policy as it has gradually evolved. The most important force behind the shift has been the views of party members. They are overwhelmingly in favour of a referendum, and of staying in the EU. They were fended off with a complicated policy at the party’s annual conference last year – the compromise once again drafted by Starmer. And the pressure from many of the trade unions – not including Unite, led by Corbyn’s ally Len McCluskey – has added to the feeling that the line could not be held.  In the end, the decisive voice will probably be that of John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor. He has consistently struck a tone more favourable to a second referendum than Corbyn’s, and he spoke at today’s shadow cabinet to say that opposition from members to the existing policy had become so great that it was time to change the party’s position. Despite briefing from the party’s spokespeople that Corbyn’s words to the shadow cabinet do not represent a change in policy, it seems there is no doubt that a policy shift is now under way.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They feel Hunt is the ideal opponent.He voted Remain in , he has been in Cabinet throughout Theresa May’s premiership with its Brexit failures and he is a mild-mannered figure who struggles to impose himself on debates.One Boris backer jokes that they have never seen, “a more lop-sided two-horse race”.The Hunt campaign bristle at the idea that this is going to be a walkover.They believe he has a route to victory by playing on Tory members’ concerns about whether Boris can actually do the job of being PM.They also think they will do well with the large Scottish membership — Scots are twice as likely to be members of the Tory party than the English — and are planning an early campaign trip there.They expect to pick up the endorsement of Ruth Davidson, the popular leader of the Scottish Conservatives.But for all Jeremy Hunt’s efforts to make this a contest, it is still Boris Johnson’s to lose. Of course, he could. He could make a spectacular gaffe or some scandal could blow up.Last night’s revelations of the screaming match at the flat he shares with his new partner shows the scrutiny that his le is going to come under.If he can get through the next fortnight without any major blunders, he’ll become Tory leader.Why  Because the postal votes go out from July  and most Tory members willthem within two days.As one Tory veteran explains: “A week after the ballots have gone out, it is too late to change anything.”I understand Boris will use the next weeks to set out his Brexit position in more detail.Those hoping to see him in full entertainer mode at these hustings will be disappointed. Instead, he intends to stick to the serious persona of the past few weeks.One of those preparing him for the month tells me that Tory members “know he can do Boris. They need to see him do Prime Minister.”This new, more serious approach won’t stop the attacks.Boris’s critics have lost their judgement and want to attack him as a homophobe, despite the fact he was one of the first politicians to back gay marriage. Just as absurdly, they want to smear him as a racist.Oddly, these attacks actually create a problem for Jeremy Hunt.The more ridiculous the criticism Boris faces, the more Tory activists will rally to him. This will make it harder for Hunt to get a hearing for his far more measured criticisms of Boris.All of these hustings will be broadcast on the internet. I understand the Boris campaign were not best pleased about this, which suggests they still have some concerns about their candidate slipping up.But even in this age of political upsets, it is hard to believe that Boris Johnson won’t be the winner of this contest.EDDIE Lister is to run the transition team that will prepare Boris Johnson’s governing programme.Lister, chief of staff for Boris when he was Mayor of London, will take charge of this process and the working assumption is that having done this, he will move to No as chief of staffBoris becomes PM.Crucially, Boris knows and trusts Lister. In his successful stint at City Hall, Lister showed that he knew how to bring order to Boris world – which is no mean feat.One of those close to the decision tells me: “Boris has made the biggest shout, who is your number one man  It is Eddie.” The need for order is urgent.If Boris enters Downing Street, he’ll only have  days until October , the day by which he has promised Britain will be out of the EU. He won’t have any time to lose.Intriguingly, I understand that Sajid Javid – who was knocked out of the leadership race on Thursday – was interested in doing this role.But the Johnson camp wanted whoever ran the transition to become the Downing Street chief of staff. A key challenge for Lister will be to make sure there is a clear structure.Boris has always liked having multiple sources of advice.As one of those who has known him for years observes: “There are going to be lots of dferent courts, lots of people competing for the monarch’s ear – and he quite likes that.”But this source warns that, “as a recipe for government, it could be quite fractious”.It is Lister’s job to make sure there is a clear chain of command.I understand that the spoilt ballot papers weren’t covered in graffiti, but simply left blank.“THE problem is the ,” says one of those preparing Boris for government.The  is a reference to those Tory MPs who voted for Rory Stewart before his elimination from the leadership contest.If only a fraction of this group decides to try to bind Boris Johnson’s hands on Brexit, then the Government could collapse.One of Boris’s closest allies warns that, “It is going to be really problematic, there is going to be a Remainer counterweight to the ERG”, the group of hardline Brexiteer MPs.To the alarm of Boris’ allies, Rory Stewart is uninterested in serving in a Boris Cabinet. Instead, he is setting himself up as an alternative voice on the backbenches.Stewart and his supporters have to remember, though, that a Corbyn government would be worse for this country than any Brexit outcome.The problem for Boris Johnson is that his Brexit strategy relies on MPs giving him time to seehe can use the threat of No Deal to winkle a concession out of the EU.The only chance of these  MPs giving him this time isthey think it is a bluff.“They have to believe it is a bluff, the ERG have to believe it is for real,” con- cedes one Boris ally.Pulling this off is going to be a political high-wire act.BORIS Johnson and Michael Gove have spoken since Gove’s elimination.I’m told the conversation wasn’t substantive but wasn’t rancorous, despite the tactical voting by Johnson supporters that led to Gove being knocked out.In the next few weeks Gove will get on with departmental business. He’ll introduce “Natasha’s law” for clearer labelling of allergens in products, named after Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, who died after eating a Pret sandwich, and increased sentences for those who abuse animals.I am told that it is “not settled one way or the other” whether Prime Minister Boris would keep Gove at the Environment department or offer him a bigger job. But given the scale of the challenges facing theTories, it would be foolish to not put their most talented departmental minister in one of the great offices of state.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She said everyone knows such photos can be hi- jacked and used to threaten and embarrass.I am sure that Whoopi meant well but it all backfired when an emotional Bella posted a video saying how upset she was at being “shamed” by the presenter and actress, — calling her actions “sick and disgusting”.I find it utterly baffling that Bella was more distressed by the words of a middle-aged woman who had her best interests at heart than the saddo who tried to embarrass her by releasing nude photos on to the internet for all the world to see.It’s a great shame this has now escalated into a row between the two women, because I truly admire Bella for how she has handled the whole potential blackmailing situation.It was a masterstroke and instantly took all the power away from the snivelling little git who was hassling her. Bella was not ashamed or embarrassed by the intimate pictures and would not be held to ransom. Good for her.But surely it was far more upsetting to be the victim of a potential crime than receiving a slight scolding from Whoopi for being naive enough to take and keep those sorts of images in the first place.Bella had a right old rant on Instagram and has vowed never again to appear on The View — a chat show co-hosted by Whoopi which is the US version of our Loose Women.I feel very sorry for Bella because she was clearly extremely upset by what Whoopi had to say but I think her anger is misplaced.Whoopi was makIng a really important point, which affects everyone, not only those in the public eye.She was speaking for worried parents of teenagers and twentysomethings everywhere who are concerned that online photos of their children getting drunk, posing nude or even having sex will come back to haunt them.It is one of the real dangers of social media that our accounts are not really secure. they can be hacked with relative ease, falling out of “the cloud” and on to your boss’s Facebook — or, even worse, getting viewed by your mum and dad.There are people who think it is a jolly wheeze to post explicit photographs of former lovers online, or who do it as “revenge” for being dumped.Of course, there are those who have no common sense and post pictures of themselves romping in hotel rooms with girlfriends or boyfriends or boozily feeling each other up on holiday.The authorities are now cracking down. Last August, a man who hacked into hundreds of iCloud accounts of Hollywood actresses and leaked their nude pictures was sentenced to eight months in prison.George Garofano stole private photographs from movie stars including actresses Jenner Lawrence and Kirsten Dunst. It was horribly distressing for these women and I completely sympathise.However, the ease with which that slimy toad was able to access personal images proves thatyou don’t want to have potentially embarrassing photos put out there, then don’t take them in the first place — or just press the delete button.Maybe even go back to the Dark Ages, invest in a Polaroid camera and keep your naughty pictures under lock and key. The hackers are vile, but let us not give them the ammunition. And take heed of the advice from wise women such as Whoopi.I SINCERELY hope the latest rumours from the troubled set of the new Bond film prove to be without foundation.It’s being claimed that the film’s director, Cary Fukunaga, held up cast and crew during a complicated shoot because he was playing video games on his PlayStation.Apparently the production crew and actors were not amused at having to hang about for three hours because Cary wanted to play with his toys. I don’t blame them.I cannot believe someone would be so inconsiderate to fellow professionals.I was, however, more aghast at finding out Cary isn’t a spotty teenage geek, but a -year-old man.Surely he should have outgrown PlayStation by now – especially when he is already in charge of the world’s best video game, involving Aston Martin car chases, shootouts, beautul women and dastardly villains.WILLIAM and Kate showed how royals should react when their lestyle causes harm to a member of the public.Widow Irene Mayor, , was hit by a police motorbike escorting the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to Windsor Castle. She is in hospital with serious injuries.As soon as Wills and Kate found out, they sent flowers and a hand-written note and have told Irene’s family they want to visit her whenever she is ready.I HAVE never watched Love Island. So it’s odd to see images and videos of strange, orange people with impossibly white teeth, like Molly-Mae Hague on my online news feeds and splashed across magazines when I haven’t a blinking clue who they are.And it is utterly bizarre that they all look and sound exactly alike.To be honest,I really need to see fit youngsters strutting around, uttering meaningless sounds and having sex, I will tune into a David Attenborough documentary.THE Fab Five presenters on makeover show Queer Eye are making the world a better place – one scruffy, messed-up person at a time.Makeovers are hardly a new concept but this series does much more than give someone a new outfit and haircut.The hosts lovebomb shy misfits who ask for help, as well as big-hearted people who just neglect themselves – then change their lives for ever.It’s a show full of heart and soul and I blub during every episode.This week I met the British star of Queer Eye, delightful Tan France, from Doncaster. He had a hard time growing up in a world where he had no role models and he feels a huge responsibility to young gay Asian men such as himself.Tan and the Queer Eye boys feature in the video for Taylor Swt’s new single, You Need To Calm Down, with some of my favourite people including RuPaul and Ryan Reynolds.The song hits you over the head a bit with its inclusivity – no bad thing – but the Queer Eye boys do it better just by being themselves.I HAD to look twice at this gorgeous selfie posted by This Morning’s Alison Hammond.She’s glowing with confidence and happiness.After becoming the spokeswoman for a slimming club Alison has lost so much weight and looks stunning.She has talked about being “embarrassed” by weighing st. But I’m so glad she lost weight gradually with a healthy eating plan and doing exercise she loves.I wish Alison all the best with her battle towards being happier, healthier and fitter and I know she will have helped other women with their weight issues too.I BLOODY love Matt Lucas. The Little Britain star saw on Twitter that Amy Dunn was being bullied because she had lost her hair and was being derided as a “Matt Lucas lookalike”.The comedian immediately sent the -year-old a message of support telling her she was beautul and how flattered he was to be compared to her.Amy, who suffers from alopecia, has had people laughing and pointing at her in the street because she happens to have a condition that means she is bald.I hope having Matt on her side has cheered Amy up and given her the confidence to ignore the morons who hurled abuse, and maybe even feel sorry for them for being such ar**holes.Matt is right. Amy is beautul, and so is he.I’M very much liking the look of Beecham House, the new ITV drama set in th Century India that airs tomorrow night.The trails look sumptuous and now Poldark’s Aidan Turner has gone all grungy, leading man Tom Bateman is a most welcome piece of eye candy.Beecham House is on ITV tomorrow at pm.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris will only be our th Prime Minister since the very first, Robert Walpole, who was in office from  to .The fact that more than a third of them went to Eton , suggests that social mobility in this country is in terminal decline.Indeed, when it comes to the children of ordinary homes reaching the highest office in the land, social mobility is stone-cold dead.Fee-paying privilege provides the fast-track to power. Yet it wasn’t always this way.There was a golden age of ­meritocracy in the last century when it was normal for our PMs to be educated by the state.Eton was still a bastion of academic excellence in those happy years. So was Harrow, which has produced seven Prime Ministers, and Westminster, which educated six.But between  and , there was enough healthy social mobility in this country for Harold Wilson, Ted Heath, Jim Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher and John Major — all educated at state schools — to become Prime Minister.Major and Callaghan didn’t even go to university. Callaghan couldn’t afford it, while Major left school at  with three O-levels.All five came from modest ­backgrounds, although Wilson, Heath and Thatcher were clever enough to get into Oxford University.For more than three decades, state-educated politicians competed with those who were the product of expensive private educations — and beat them to the top job.This is not an argument against Boris Johnson becoming Prime ­Minister simply because he went to Eton. Boris seems like the man most likely to prevent a Marxist government. This would destroy our economy — a fate far worse than either staying in or leaving the European Union.SoI was a Tory MP or party member, then I would probably prefer Boris to take on Brussels, Corbyn and the Brexit Party.But yet another old Etonian in  Downing Street proves that social mobility is nowhere near what it was in the last century. Andwe care about a fair and equal society, then that should concern us all.It feels signicant that the first candidate to be eliminated from the Tory leadership race was Esther McVey — the candidate from  the least privileged background, reinforcing the belief that Westminster is a closed shop.But when it comes to getting on in le, and even getting to Downing Street, it should not matter a damn where you were born.Your ability — and your willingness to graft — should matter far more than Mummy and Daddy’s bank ­balance.Le can never be totally fair. But two Old Etonian PMs in less than ten years is grotesque.  If there is to be a bright, shining future for this country after we leave the EU, there MUST be more social mobility.Once he has sorted out Brexit  and buried Corbyn, perhaps our Old ­Etonian PM will do something about it. Because inequality is still entrenched at birth.And that stinks.WHAT is mankind’s greatest invention  The Internet  The printing press  The steam engine  Penicillin If, like me, you are allergic to penicillin, then the gold shorts that Kylie Minogue wore in her Spinning Around promo probably have the edge on all of them. Kylie’s gold gear might make a comeback when she plays Glastonbury next Sunday.And  years after their debut, nobody has ever developed an allergy to them.As the wolf evolved into the dog, it sussed that making its eyes bigger made the humans go all soft and gooey inside.Dr Juliane Kaminski, of the University of Ports- mouth, says: “The evidence is compelling that dogs developed a muscle to raise the inner eyebrow after they were domesticated from wolves. It seems to elicit a strong desire in humans to look after them.”Those puppy-dog eyes are designed to make your heart melt.Certainly when Stan, our Cavalier King Charles spaniel, looks at me with his enormous, big round peepers, I understand the three little words he is trying to say.Give. Stan. Cheese.IT is weird the way even the greatest TV series can go off the boil.On the surface, the second series of Killing Eve has everything that made the first such a blast.Jodie Comer is still brilliant as psychopathic assassin Villanelle, doing a iety of convincing accents and changing her clothes more often than Diana Ross in concert.Sandra Oh is again wonderful as the sexually confused, domestically challenged spook.But I have watched the entire second series now and it just doesn’t catch fire the way the first did.And that is because the first series of Killing Eve had three female stars in Jodie Comer, Sandra Oh and – behind the scenes – Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge, who wrote the script.Now Waller-Bridge has gone off to save the screenplay of the next James Bond movie.And Killing Eve badly misses her magic dust.JEW-HATING has become the racism  that is permissible.The Prime Minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, told the Cambridge Union debating society that his Jewish friends: “Are not like the other Jews – that’s why they are my friends.”He got a laugh.If he had said “black” or “Muslim”, he would have been nicked.THERE are some scary TV shows out there.Doing Question Time is daunting because you can be certain that at least half of the audience will hate your guts.Have I Got News For You  is forbidding because the ageing team captains and presenters have been doing it since the dawn of time and are used to the show’s format .But nothing comes close to the terror factor of Mastermind.To sit in that black leather chair as the lights go down is to know true stage fright. So Hamish Cameron must have been a very brave man indeed.Hamish held the record for the most appearances on Mastermind –  – and after filming the final last November, he learned he had terminal cancer.Shortly before the final was broadcast last week, Hamish died at the age of .The BBC had considered postponing the broadcast as a mark of respect but Hamish had instructed his family that he wanted the show to go on.As someone who vowed “never again” after sitting in that hot seat just the once, I can only salute Hamish’s courage.The Mastermind catchphrase “I’ve started so I’ll finish” could have been invented for this fearless man.IF Heathrow gets a third runway, then the impact on the environment will be huge, with hundreds of extra flights landing and taking  off every day.And that’s just for Emma Thompson!Their honeymoon must have been filthy.ANDREA LEADSOM says she was told by senior Tory women that they could not back her because the party couldn’t have “another woman” Prime Minister so soon after Theresa May.But the Tories’ past willingness to be led by a woman is surely something to celebrate.  The Conservatives will almost certainly be on their third female Prime Minister before the -year-old male-dominated Labour Party has its first.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So why feel guilty about watching it The appeal of this show is fairly obvious — it’s the intimate access you get.Viewers feel like they’re on holiday on on the island too, as invisible guests.The ultimate fly-on-the-wall experience.We hear the most private of conversations, witness the most explosive fallouts. We even get in the shower with them.It’s so intimate that it feels the same as when you read someone ’s diary.Of course, we are watching insanely beautul people parading around in tiny scraps of swimwear. But no matter how gorgeous the contestants, each one is revealed to be as fragile as the next.I think that is where our real fascination lies.Surely they should all be full of confidence, looking the way they do  And yet they seem to be just as insecure as the rest of us.I like the fact that the show is a portal into a generation to which I no longer belong.I’ve learned so much about how young men and women behave and, until Maura uttered the words, I didn’t even know it was possible to have “fanny flutters”.Another thing I like is the escapism. Surely it’s no coincidence that Love Island is at peak popularity during a time when the news is totally dominated with gloom, doom — and Brexit.Personally, I’m also intrigued by the fake hair and nails — and the very y process of getting ready for a night out. I’m luckyI put a comb through my hair.The amount of make-up they manage to get on to their faces is astonishing — although the irony is that the one girl all the guys seem to like, Lucie, is a surfer chick who doesn’t wear make-up.There is also a real cruelty to the show, though. There is always someone better, someone more chosen. The voting process is brutal and leaves all of the contestants anxious about whether or not people like them.This show strips people of everything that is important, other than their body. They are measured on what they look like and little .As a result, lots of people have questioned the damage caused to the mental health of the contestants.There have been more than , complaints to Ofcom about this series already.But there are good things about Love Island.While it’s not exactly the kind of equality that women have been fighting for over the past  years, there’s no denying that female members in the house are as free as the men to proposition members of the opposite sex.In my day, all we had was: “My mate fancies you.” But Maura said of one guy that he gave her “fanny flutters”.When my daughter Sophia was asked to go on the show, she thought it would be fun to be on a free holiday. You can see her point.But no mother wants to watch their child on Love Island. We all know there are plenty of things our kids do that we don’t know about — and that’s the way it should stay.But it’s not just that. One reason I enjoy being part of the Apprentice is because it celebrates young people for their skills, ambition and what they achieve.They know they aren’t being valued for their looks — they are being valued for so much more than that.That said, no one’s self- esteem should be based on how others value us.I’ve often thought that my biggest superpower is that I really don’t care what people think about me.When I’m on the beach I’m not bothered about which bits and pieces are jiggling.Why  Because there is so much more to me than what I look like in a bikini.Or, rather, as a footballer’s we once said to me: “All I’ve got is my looks — at least you’ve got your personality.”I know it was a back-handed compliment. But you know what, I’m fine with that.LOTTIE Moss said on social media that she feels “uncomfortable” with her weight at the moment – as she posted a picture of herself in a dress on a night out.My first thought was she’s going to look back at those photos when she is in her fties and wonder how she could have felt uncomfortable when she looked like this.My second was she can’t worry that much because the dress she’s wearing is almost completely see-through.BOSSES of the Isle of Wight Festival have been criticised by two mental-health charities for banning Jess Glynne for le after the singer cancelled her show at the last minute, owing to anxiety.Anxiety is a debilitating condition which blights the lives of many people.I’m sorry to hear that Jess is one of those people.But when she knows she suffers from this condition, her choice to stay out partying with the Spice Girls until am on the day she was due to perform seems, well, questionable.Having been out drinking all night before work is enough to make even the most level-headed person anxious.To then go on social media advertising that fact, before effectively phoning in sick to work, is also a tad foolish.By doing that, Glynne gave the impression she chose partying over a commitment – and that is not a good look.If we have one job to do as parents, it is to teach our kids the importance of doing the things that need to be done, when they need to be done, whether you like it or not.When I see a young person doing what they said they would do, despite challenges, I know they’ve got backbone.It’s called resilience, grit, determination, and it’s about being irrepressible. Those are some of the most admirable traits a person can have.Anxiety is awful but it’s certainly not helped by partying until the early hours of a work day.THIS week there has been good and bad news for Boris Johnson. The good news is that it looks ashe is going to be our next Prime Minister.The bad news is not that early-hours row with his partner – it’s his new haircut.He used to have “The Trump”, a sort of comb-forward that hid his balding. But his barber has cut it off and, instead of the long-haired blond bombshell look, he’s now a blond basin with thinning top.Boris, please take it from me, when you go into a hairdresser’s the first thing you do is check out the hairstyle of the person holding the scissors.Anyway, I guess it grows back – and soon will be the haystack it’s always been. Now all Boris needs is a new suit.OOPS! My heart goes out to the mum of the rampaging toddler at a Swiss art show who knocked over a sculpture of a fly worth £,.My main question, though, is how a plastic sculpture of a fly could be worth so much money Someone, somewhere, is having a laugh. Right I WAS trying to work out what was unusual about the recent photo of actor Rob Lowe on the red carpet.I realised it’s this. He is a handsome, successful star who is still with his we – Sheryl Berkoff – after  years without trading her in for a younger model.And they look happy.A rare sight in Hollywood, so good luck to both of them.TO be fair, Sofia Richie pretty much pulled it off when she sported the latest bicycle shorts onesie – the trend you prayed would never happen.But all I can say is, I’m glad I don’t follow fashion.WHAT’S in a word  You might think nothing much. And it’s a small thing in a way, but Sainsbury’s needs to be called out for assuming on its hair-removal product that all doctors are male.Its instructions say: “Consult your usual doctor and show him the packaging.”No doubt lots of people will respond by saying that us women are far too easily offended.But it is assumptions such as this behind the fact that, for every £ a man makes, a woman only makes p.We have to stamp out this unconscious bias by calling it out every time we see it.AMAZING that it’s  years since Friends hit our TVs.But judging by pictures of its stars Jenner Aniston, , and Courteney Cox, , on vacation in their bikinis, they still look fantastic.Even more amazing is that they are genuine friends.It just goes to show thatyou eat well, work out and look after yourself, you don’t have to be fat and flabby at .*Note to self – eat better and go to the gym. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If it is appropriate for us to use it, we will use it.Dramatic footage released last November showed Scotland Yard’s Scorpion pursuit teams hitting mopeds and sending suspects sprawling over car bonnets and flying across the tarmac.However, under existing laws, cops chasing moped thugs are subject to the same legal test for careless and dangerous driving offences as members of the public.Eventhey escape prosecution, cops can be investigated for gross misconduct and sacked.Cops who face charges often have to wait years before having their names cleared.The Home Office has insisted it is “reviewing” the law to give officers greater protection but critics said they must push through new legislation as a priorityThe documentary also interviews members of moped gangs who commit crimes and vigilantes who risk their lives to hunt the yobs.Scotland Yard introduced the bold new tactic of ramming moped thieves to widespread acclaim after violent gangs wreaked havoc on the streets of Lawless London in a terrying crime epidemic.The growth of moped crime - in which some criminals have stolen up to  phones in an hour - has exploded by , per cent across the UK in the past three years.And Lawless London has seen the highest spike in moped muggings, where over , separate offences were recorded last year alone.Victims are often targeted as theyre coming out of tube stations and other transport hubs where theyre more vulnerable to attacks.Thieves snatch handbags, watches and other expensive items before making an easy getaway.Cops had been criticised due to a widespread belief that they werent allowed to pursue a suspect on a mopedthey werent wearing a helmet.But proposed changes in the law make it explicit that specially trained police drivers can chase a rider without a helmet.Forces have previously unveiled other tactics to fight moped crime, like automatic tyre deflation devices and DNA tagging spray.And the tactics appear to be working - while there were , offences of moped crime in London between January and October last year, the same period has seen , offences this year - a reduction of  per cent.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Fexofenadineis a fantastic antihistamine that is only available on prescription. In my experience is one of the most effective around.And whilst some antihistamines are marketed as non-drowsy, some iniduals are particularly sensitive, and will still find themselves experiencing some fatigue.Some lesser known side effects include a dry mouth throat, dry eyes and blurred vision.Medications that block histamine receptors help allergic conditions, but these types of medications can reduce mucous and aqueous production, which cause dry eye and mouth complaints.Adding eye drops to your regime can be really useful to help combat the itchy eyes.Nasal decongestants are often combined with anticholinergic medications which together contribute to dry eyes, dilated pupils and decreased response to bright light.The dilated pupils interfere with your ability to focus on objects and can, therefore, contribute to blurry vision.Boots pharmacist Natalie Masters said: “You may have seen reports on rising pollen counts this weekend.If you’re a hayfever sufferer, don’t panic. When there’s more pollen in the air, your symptoms may worsen, but there are lots of steps you can take to alleviate these.Prevention is key, which means avoiding coming into contact with pollen in the first place.Grassy areas are often best avoided andyou can, don’t spend time outdoors at the times when pollen counts are highest, typically the early morning and late afternoon and evening.If you need to go outside, applying a petroleum jelly balm to the inside of your nostrils or using an allergy barrier nasal spray can help prevent pollen from entering your nostrils, whilst larger wraparound sunglasses can help stop pollen from irritating your eyes.There’s also several products you can purchase which can help to alleviate your symptoms when they start flaring up.Speak to your pharmacist about anti-histamine tablets, hayfever eye drops or a suitable steroid nasal spray.If you’ve been outdoors when the pollen count is high, make sure to shower and wash your hair once you get home to wash away any stray pollen particles.Regularly vacuuming and dusting your house with a damp cloth and washing and drying your clothes indoors may also help to keep your home a pollen-free zone.Importantly, try not to be worried or stressed about your hayfever. It has been claimed that hayfever can be exacerbated by this, so try to keep calm and consider dferent products and methods – hopefully you’ll soon find what works best for you.”Boots is currently has their own brand hay fever products on offer for  for £, including Boots One-A-Day Allergy Relief mg tabletsand  Boots Hayfever Relief for Adults  micrograms dose Nasal Spray  Metered Sprays .Branded products are also on offer at two for £.Nasal Sprays are particularly helpful for the rhinitisor blocked nose symptoms, which antihistamine tablets may not always take care of. Beconase is always a good start, but mometasoneor Fluticasone based sprays such as Avamys and Dymista, can provide that next step for relief.But in some iniduals, nasal sprays can cause some localised irritation within the nostrils, and even nose bleeds.The most important thing about nasal sprays is ensuring you are using them correctly. It is worth noting that they do not work immediately, and their effects are cumulative, meaning the longer you use them, the better the response – so you’ll need patience before you see results.Prolonged use of over the counter decongestant nasal sprays can create a rebound rhinosinusitisused for too long – in essence, they can make symptoms worseused for more than  or  days.What should you do should you experience any of these symptoms Dr Fenton says thatyou experience any of these side effects, its important to discuss them with your GP.He said: There is a multitude of alternative antihistamines, spray and drops that may be more suited to you.Alternatives include using medications used for asthma, such as Montelukast, which is excellent for the runny nose component of hay fever.In addition, some well-known antacidsdespite mainly being used for acid reflux and heartburn, can actually have great antihistamine effects.When all  fails, you may consider the hay fever injection, which is a steroid-based injection. This is not to be taken lightly, as is not without risks, but it can be beneficial to those with sever hay fever.Dr Fenton added: The truth behind hay fever treatment is that it can be trial and error.You have to take the time to find the right combination of treatments for you.Speaking to your GP is useful, as they will take you through all of the options and recommend, prescribe and administer the correct hay fever medications as needed."},{"url":null,"title":"sunny beach nightclub bulgaria holiday","story":"Den Glade Viking is one of the many party bars at the Sunny Beach resort - a huge party town by the Black Sea where young Brits flock for the summer.In pictures taken at the bars many events and parties, ladies and gents can be seen frolicking together and dancing scantily-clad on top of the bar.Speaking to the Daily Star, a spokesperson for the raunchy club said that dancing naked on the bar was encouraged.He said: Anyone can dance naked on bars.Our slogan is the only place where it’s allowed to dance naked on the bar’.Events at Den Glade Viking include the UV party - where teens draw rude images on each other with brightly coloured pens.The bars spokesperson added: “There’s tonnes of mischievous sex games going on during the beach parties and Full Moon Parties.“Your typical - crowd games.”After her visit, Shannon Currie, from Wigan in Greater Manchester, left a positive review on the bars Facebook page and said its the only place that allows a naked dance on the bar.She added: I cant wait to be back.Other young Brits on Facebook have raved about the party bar too, calling it the best place to party in Sunny Beach and saying they had some of the best nights of their le there.The bar is part of a pub crawl run by workers at the resort.Den Glade Viking is one of a few stops that offer free drinks and shots to young people who come along for the party.The nightclub has a pool that is frequented by hardcore party-goers during the day.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Joy’s daughters – Kelly, Teresa and Michele – had decided to find out for themselves why their mother had picked up bruises and bed sores when she’d only been in the home a few weeks.    The answer was heartbreakingly shocking. The sentences for the feral trio – suspended jail terms and community service orders – even more so. The home in which my own grandmother-in-law spent her latter years preserved her safety and her dignity. Lots of care homes across the country have been proactive in installing cameras themselves. For too many others, however, it a dferent story, a problem scandalously still not adequately addressed.Health Secretary Matt Hancock , now back to his day job after his opportunistic bid to be Prime Minister, has been broadly supportive of CCTV. Former Tory attorney general Dominic Grieve also called last year for legislation to make it compulsory in all care homes.Health and Social Care Minister Caroline Dinenage, however, believes the decision should be left up to inidual care home providers. In other words, lots of talk but no action. It is remarkable that an outcry from animal welfare activists led to CCTV in all abattoirs last year, yet for our elderly in care no such protection exists.

More than , readers were brave enough to sign up, and hundreds finally met their political opposite yesterday in Huddersfield and Hull, Devon and Bristol, Edinburgh and Brecon.

They came together over the NHS, their local football team, public transport and most of all the need to talk to each other. Described as “political Tinder”, Britain Talks is based on My Country Talks – an initiative from German news website Zeit Online. The original experiment has been repeated in Italy, Norway, Denmark, Switzerland and Austria, as Europe confronts its isions.

Self-confessed “hopeless idealist” Phil says: “I think we want the same thing really – a better world where people take more care of each other, take more responsibility and are prepared to go out of their way rather than just think about themselves.” Adam, , who trades over the internet, says: “I’m a firm believer in leaving the EU because it will help Britain’s trading position.” Adam, a full-time carer for his we, believes a thriving economy will create better public services.But Phil warns it could lead to “dog eat dog”. Adam says of the meeting: “It has opened my views up to someone ’s way of thinking. I feel the focus is on ‘me, me ,me’.” And he laments the way the Government shuns the elderly, forcing them to rely on charity. “It seems a case of ‘Thanks for the service, we don’t want to know about you’.” Manchester  One is a die-hard Brexiteer, the other a dedicated Remainer. “I’m sick of being called a Remoaner when all I want is a better future for my kids,” says catering assistant Donna Chadwick, , a mum of two teenage boys from Heywood. Terence Farrand, , a semi-retired builder, has lived in Europe but is clear we should be out of the EU, with no second vote. “If we do that, democracy is finished,” he warns. For Terence, married with four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, immigration means pressure on the NHS. “You can’t get an appointment when you need one,” he says. Donna says: “Yes, services are struggling but that’s more about investment.” But when Donna and Terence, from Whitefield, meet over wine and coffee, they find a shared love of Bury Football Club – and agree the NHS needs cash. “It’s been good to have someone to listen to what I’ve got to say, without being shouted down,” says Donna, as they decide to meet up again this week. Terence agrees. “I have strong opinions but we live in a world where people are scared to express them, or to speak to someone with dferent views.” Brecon Beacons  In the foothills of the Brecon Beacons, Annette Lloyd and Emily Durrant are searching for common ground in a canal-side cafe. Emily was not even born when Annette started her first job in a factory, and they are never going to agree on Brexit. But there is much to unite them... Emily, , juggles two young children and three jobs, including her role as a Green Party county councillor. Meanwhile, Annette, , toils on nights as a support worker and helps to look after her grandchildren and elderly relatives. Both agree low wages and austerity mean families are under pressure. Emily, who also works for the National Trust, says: “The economy doesn’t work for families. Wages are just too low.” Emily, from Llangorse, Powys, is a committed Remainer. Annette, , favours Brexit. “It’ll get the factories working again,” she says. But Emily finds common ground with Annette, from Llandeilo Graban, over the NHS. “We’ve been sold down the river,” they agree. Before going their separate ways, Annette and Emily hug and laugh. “When you look at the bigger picture,” Annette says, “we’re very similar.”  Stoke  In the leafy hamlet of Stockton Brook, near Stoke- on-Trent, it’s clear William Alcock and Louise Adams both feel passionately about their city. William, , served in the Army for  years before joining the police and Louise, , is a freelance artist who works in the ceramics industry. And William, now retired, doesn’t hesitate to air his views about Brexit. He says: “We are spending £million a day to be in the EU. That is what we are paying the thieves in Brussels. They have taken away our sovereignty. “We are losing control of this country and we are losing control of our cultures.” Louise believes we should stay in the EU. “It will allow us to build on love, peace and friendships,” she says. “Being part of the EU has allowed us to work together, share cultures and ideas.” Louise believes that with the right investment refugees can settle here successfully but William is concerned about the pressure it puts on the NHS. But they agree they both want what’s best for their beloved country.

Till worker Brian Leach was dismissed after a colleague in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, complained that the comments in the Scottish comedianaposs skit, which was years old, were anti-Islamic. The -year-old disabled granddad, who has been accused of Islamophobia, said he was hauled into a meeting and later dismissed without notice for violating Asdaaposs social media policy. In a dismissal letter from Asda, Mr Leach admitted the post was offensive, that he removed it and apologised to colleagues who were upset, Examiner Live reports.    The letter said Mr Leach was sacked for gross misconduct. The video referred to in the post is Mr Connollyaposs Religion is Over taken from his live stage act a number of years ago. In the sketch, the comedian rails against religious followers of Christianity and Islam. It includes the lines: Religion is over, lads, itaposs f****** over. Take your Reformation, your Vatican, your f****** Mecca, and f*** off. Suicide f****** bombing - now thereaposs a bright idea. Every time thereaposs a bang the world is a w***** short. F****** idiots.  Mr Leach said he is devastated after being sacked after working for Asda for five years. He claims he was grassed up by an Asda employee who worked for its head office. He added: She was upset. I was aware that she was upset. I was then pulled into a meeting a couple of weeks later on  May in Dewsbury and then on Wednesday,  June, I was summarily dismissed without notice following a disciplinary meeting for breaching the companyaposs social media policy. Iaposm really upset and I would love to know what Billy Connolly would think about what has happened to me. I didnapost have enough money to join a union so I have not been able to appeal the decision.  I have to go into Asda today to give back my two discount cards and my locker key. He claims screen grab of his post was posted on Instagram, and that has left him fearing for his le. Mr Leach announced his dismissal on Facebook , writing last week: Unfortunately, I have today been dismissed from Asda. Some of my colleagues took offence to the Billy Connelly, , thoughts on religion, that I posted early May. Itaposs been a pleasure working with my friends and serving the public of Dewsbury and I will miss my regular customers x. He later wrote: Feeling lost today. I would be getting prepared for my busy Sunday afternoon sht.  - . oh well Iaposve got to get past this feeling. The dismissal letter from Asda said he admitted the post was offensive, that he removed it and apologised to affected colleagues.  It said he had committed a gross misconduct offence, and his Facebook post had the potential to bring the company into disrepute. His apology to bosses read: I fully acknowledge my sharing of material online within my Facebook account regarding religion has upset many people and understand it to be a very serious breach of the company social media policy. In mitigation, I immediately removed the item causing offence and removed the association with Asda on my profile, also removing Colleagues from Facebook friendship who may have been deeply offended by such post. I have spoken to affected Colleagues apologising for my post, taking their feedback onboard. I have realised peopleaposs faiths are very important to them, and the nature of the post regarding the sensitive nature of it relating to the holy place of Islam. If I had faith I can imagine being very upset myself. Saying that the post shared is a joke by Billy Connellynot my personal views. But I recognise how colleagues may think this is my view. As a result I will think very carefully before posting online or saying anything that could be interpreted as hurtful to others and my place of work. He added: I believe this has been a wake up call and will not be repeated. I would like the opportunity to prove that this post does not reflect who I am. An Asda spokesman said: We would never comment on inidual circumstances. However we do not tolerate any form of discrimination from colleagues or customers and take such behaviour extremely seriously.” "},{"url":null,"title":"i lived vegan food week","story":"NewsWhat I learnt living as a vegan for a week - and how much it costThere are now , vegans in the UK, but would the switch to a plant-based diet be too much for this convert ShareCommentsByAnna Reilly:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsThe cost of some vegan items could put people off\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailVeganism is gaining in popularity across the UK, with over half a million Britons claiming to follow plant-based diets. The dramatic growth has seen a  per cent increase of self-professed vegans in the last  years, according to the Vegan Society.While vegans were once the butt of jokes, preconceptions have changed about those that swear off meat, dairy, and animal products, with more and more changing diet in a bid to improve our health as well as being kinder to the planet.Switching to veganism can see  fewer animals slaughtered yearly for meat, and thereaposs also plenty of evidence to show that a meat-free diet is the single biggest way to reduce our impact on the earth.HullLive reporter Anna Riley decided to give the vegan diet a go for a week - hereaposs how she got on.   It was tough at first The whole premise of  veganism  is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose. This means eating a plant-based diet, avoiding all foods such as meat, fish and shellfish, dairy, eggs and even honey as well as animal-derived materials and products tested on animals. As commendable as this lestyle is, for a le-long meat eater, as well as often eating eggs and a LOVER of cheese, the challenge to go coldturkey was certainly a tough one. It was dficult at first to think of tasty vegan recipes to make for my meals that would be tasty compared to the meat and fish that were staples in much of the food I was used to eating.  Luckily, my almost vegan friendhelped me out when I asked for advice on what to shop for, and advised me to eat fruit for snacks, as well as stocking up on vegetables, nuts, beans and pulses to make a iety of meals that she sent over, including stews, curries, salads, stir fry and more. She also signposted me to plenty of vegan inspired recipes to look at online for inspiration.    It was more expensive and took time to shop Because I needed to replace all the dairy items that I normally had with vegan alternatives, my shop cost me nearly £ just for staples and snacks, much more than it normally wouldI was buying ordinary milk, cheese, butter, yoghurts, crisps and chocolate. Along with spending more on these items, there was also a much more limited selection on offer. I could only find two ieties of vegan cheese in the Tesco extra store in Hull St Stephenaposs Centre, which I was surprised by, and there was only a small selection of dairy free yoghurts. I went to Aldi for my main fruit and veg shop and was happily surprised to find a vegan section there, which included curry pots, sweet potato and beetroot burgers and red pepper and butternut squash sausages, as well as low calorie vegan pea snap crisps, so I snapped all of these up along with the lentils, beans, tinned tomatoes and spices in my trolley. As I wasnapost buying meat or fresh fish, which can add up, and instead bulking up on veg, Iaposd say that in the end I spent roughly as much as normal on my shop,not a little more for the vegan alternatives and ready meals. It also took me more time than normal to shop, as not many products are already labelled aposveganapos, so I had to scour the back of many packets to check that they contained no animal product at all, and even accidentally ended up getting cereal bars that werenapost vegan, as they had honey in them. One evening on my late sht I also had to grab something at Tesco for tea on my break but there were no vegan sandwiches in sight, as egg and cheese were the only meatless options, so I ended up shelling out £ for a tofu ready meal that was granted very tasty, but also very costly.    Tea rounds and office snacks were a no go Not wanting to bring a large carton of dairy free milk to work just for hot drinks for myself, I didnapost join in with the tea rounds other than to have a black coffee, and even then my colleagues would forget that I was aposoff milkapos and accidentally add it to my drink when they were making me one. Food Reviews  I also had to dodge the snacks that my kind colleagues brought into the office such as chocolate doughnuts and cakes, as they were also made with dairy products. Clearly, dairy is a lot more prominent in our everyday lives than I once thought. The food was tasty    I thought that I would be hankering for meat throughout the week, being used to eating it on a regular basis, but the food I made and ate was actually delicious - and the vegan cheese was even palatable, but of course not as good as the original version. There was plenty of iety in what I had and I didnapost feel like I was missing out with the vegan diet. The only thing that I did yearn for towards the end of the week was eggs, as I do enjoy them now and again for breakfast or in a fritatta or quiche. The vegan ready meals from the supermarket are definitely something Iaposd eat again, and Iaposd make some of the same recipes again, including the butternut squash bangers and mash, veggie stir fry, lentil stew, ratatouille, and curry, with plenty also for leftovers the next day. I also didnapost miss milk or yoghurt, with the dairy free alternatives tasting just as good andnot better in my porridge, tea, coffee and smoothies, and the dairy free butter even being nice on toast. The vegan chocolate also went down well, and I couldnapost get enough of the pea snack crisps. Other than the taste, another thing I noticed about the vegan meals was that I was not as full as I normally would be when eating a non-plant based meal, and felt hungrier than normal, perhaps because I wasnapost getting enough protein or eating enough carbs. Eating out was dficult    Despite their being places in Hull that cater for vegans , it was dficult to find a iety of choice when eating out at restaurants which cater to mainly meat eaters. I felt very picky when I went out for dinner to a aposnon-veganapos eatery, and was disappointed at the menu choice for my needs. Luckily there are places near me like Zoo Café which have a wide iety of veggie and vegan meals and donapost serve meat, but it would be nicer to see more vegan options on the menu at other restaurants around the city. I avoided wine and beer  Much to my dismay, and previously unbeknown to me, I found buying beer and wine a faff, as it can be processed using animal products such as isinglass , egg whites, caseinand even bone marrow, making it non-veganprocessed in this way. There are several common fining agents that are animal-friendly and used to make vegan wine and beer like limestone and silica gel as suitable alternatives, but it takes time to look for this on the back of a bottle, and is often more expensive, so I just gave booze and the pub a swerve for the week. But fortunately, virtually every brand of hard liquor like bourbon, whiskey, vodka, gin, and rum is vegan, so I took heart in this should I have wanted a drink. I felt better for it  Throughout the challenge, I actually had more energy through following the vegan diet, which gave me the boost to exercise more, and by the end of the week Iaposd actually lost weight and felt much better in general. My skin was also clearer, perhaps because I was eating healthier, and sorryitaposs oversharing, but I also noticed that I went to the toilet a lot more because I was consuming more fibre through all the veg, which may have also contributed to the weight loss. I also felt better morally that I was doing my bit for the planet and animals through the diet. Final thoughts  Even though I found the concept of going vegan for a week quite daunting, and found it dficult at first, I actually really benefited from the experience and would recommend everyone to at least give it a try to see how they get on. Iaposm certainly not saying that Iaposm going to turn my nose up to a crispy bacon sandwich from now on, or demand a nut roast instead of traditional old chicken, nor will I refuse a sausage and a beef burger at a barbecue, or shun a pizza topped with all the cheese. But living off a purely plant based diet has made me think just how much we rely on animal products, and how ingrained they are in our daily lives, which can be at times unhealthy. Iaposll happily give up milk, yoghurts and butter from now on, as I felt much better for consuming the non-dairy alternatives, and Iaposm going to make more of an effort to make more vegan meals as they taste great, and are better for the environment.

Imagination is necessary in spades however, because for this particular property, viewing is not essential, or even advised. In fact, potential buyers are warned ‘DO NOT enter the cottage UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES’. And since Lavender Cottage went up for sale in , firstly for £,, and then inviting offers in the region of £,, no-one has been allowed inside... until now.  Inside the abandoned Aleister Crowley house of West Cornwall  After following the old path on my hands and knees through the undergrowth for about  feet, I reach Lavender Cottage, completely hidden in a Cornish jungle of brambles and stinging nettles. Despite all the branches pushing into the building from every side like nature’s scaffolding, the structure looks decidedly unsafe, as warned. Nevertheless, I don my hard hat and delicately climb through the window.     The cottage is small and simple, with the ground floor split in half by a staircase iding what was once a lounge and a kitchen, leading upstairs to where there was once two bedrooms. The cottage features on historic maps dating back to .  The empty bottles of Corona also date back to the eighties, when people could redeem p when they ed the bottles to be recycled.In , UK Environment Secretary Michael Gove proposed that similar schemes were reintroduced to encourage people to recycle bottles by financial incentives.The  pence redeemable for the two Corona bottles is included in the price of the property.    Since this half drunken can of Coke was left on a rusting fridge, at least three decades have passed. The Berlin Wall has fallen, as have almost all of the interior walls in Lavender Cottage.  However, the cottage has not been untouched during that time. There are signs inside where repairs have started in earnest. Cob has been used to try and sure up some of the walls, as has concrete in places, such as around the old Rayburn.    In , a planning application for ‘alterations and erection of extension sites’ were ‘approved with conditions’. With the house derelict at this time, there are no obvious signs that these plans came to fruition.      Transforming the cottage from a two bedroomed house with no toilet into a three bedroomed home with bathroom and downstairs W.C., the plans appear to have been approved by Carrick District Council, but again, never became a reality.   The first Google Street View car to drive past Lavender Cottage, did so in June .A ‘WARNING KEEP OUT’ sign can be seen on the side of the house, which is still there today somewhere underneath the foliage. However, there appears to be repair work on the roof and front of the building, and a caravan on the land has its door open, asoccupied.    Lavender Cottage went on the market for £, with Camel Homes in , described as offering the ‘opportunity to live the dream in Cornwall and create your own perfect home’.    Despite the cottage being off limits to any prospective buyers, the estate agents say that they have had a lot of interest in the derelict property which sits on a plot of approximately . of an acre. However, no-one has snapped it up yet, and not being able to see inside it might not be the only factor putting people off.    The letter from Cornwall Council to the interested buyer concluded: “In summary the proposal that you have put forward for residential development through replacement for which Policy  of the Cornwall Local Plan is unlikely to be supported as the residential use on the site appears to have been abandoned. If you are minded to proceed with the development proposal on this site it is strongly recommended that you first obtain a Lawful Development Certicate to demonstrate that the existing home is in fact lawful.” What this essentially boils down to, is that planning permission to demolish Lavender Cottage and build a new home in its place is considered likely to be refused. So anyone who buys this property will have to work with what is already there, renovating the existing property as it stands.    Asthis old cottage wasn’t entangled enough with greenery, it is also now constrained by red tape. However, it doesn’t take too much of a stretch of the imagination to pull back the brambles and ivy and see this home as it once was, with its sunny garden and plentul orchard.    And standing inside Lavender Cottage, red tape to one side, it is easy to see how these crumbling walls could become a home once again.If you would like to find out more about Lavender Cottage, you can get details from  Camel Homes . Do not enter the property under any circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"kylie minogue surprises twins 8","story":"NewsKylie Minogue surprises twins, , who sang her music to their dying mumLauren and Sophie Cripps, from Thatcham, Berkshire, sang Kylie Minogues Dancing to mum Alex a day before she died of a brain tumourShareCommentsByBradley JollyOnline journalist:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video kylie-minogue-surprises-twins-sophie-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email This is the adorable moment Kylie Minogue surprised grieving eight-year-old twins who had sang one of her songs to their cancer-stricken mum a day before she died.The pop legend, , arranged for Lauren and Sophie Cripps to see her backstage at her concert on Saturday.

The four-year-old is the spitting image of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridgeaposs second child, and her mum believes she looks more like her than the aposofficialapos lookalike. Her mum Gemma, , first noticed the similarities after someone pointed it out in Primark last year. She said: Marcy looks more like Princess Charlotte than the official lookalike does. People stop us as weaposre walking past and say aposoh, she looks so much like Princess Charlotteapos or admit theyaposve had to do a double take.    The first time it happened we were in Primark in Meadowhall and the woman serving us said aposoh god your daughter looks like Princess Charlotteapos. I donapost know why anyone would think she would be in Meadowhall in Sheffield without her mum - Iaposm not Princess Kate! It never clicked until she said it, it was only when I looked at pictures of her that I realised she does. The checkout girl at Birmingham Airport last year when we went on holiday to Turkey was checking her passport and did a double take too. Itaposs very flattering, Princess Charlotte is such a lovely little girl - always good fun and always looks beautul, itaposs a very nice comparison.    Marcy, who lives in Sheffield with her mum and dad Dylan Culverwell, , is  months older than her royal lookalike and even likes to dress in similar outfits. She hates wearing trousers and is happiest in skirts and dresses, similar to little Charlotte. Gemma said: Marcy gets very upsetyou put her in trousers. She likes wearing skirts and dresses because she says she doesnapost want to look like a boy. If we go to the soft play Iaposll say she canapost wear a skirt because she would burn her bum on the slide or flash [people] and that she needs to have trousers on but it isnapost worth the hassle. At that point I just say aposput what you want onapos. She has a wide iety of clothing. I like things off eBay or Primark and then higher end designer items - I like to do a mixture for her. One of her nanas goes to America a lot so she brings her loads of clothes back from there.    I wouldnapost go to the extreme of dressing her like Princess Charlotte but itaposs nice when people comment. Gemma said that more and more people have started commented on the similarity between her in the last year - both online and in person. And although not signed up with an agency Gemma said sheaposs open to little Marcy doing lookalike work. Gemma said: People have commented on photos Iaposve shared on social media saying how much she looks like her. Marcy didnapost look like her when she was a baby but has started to now that sheaposs older.    I put up a picture of Marcy next to a picture of Princess Charlotte and those who already thought it agreed. Other people commented saying they didnapost realised how similar they were until I put them together. I even had a woman message me and say aposI nearly stopped you in the school yard the other day to tell you how much she looks like Princess Charlotteapos. Sheaposs not signed with anyone but we are open to the possibility of doing lookalike work in the future. Princess Charlotte is known for her confidence, and Gemma said her little girl has a matching aposfeistyapos personality. She has been competing in pageant competitions for the past year which her mum thinks has helped her come out her shell.    Gemma said: She can be quite shy when you first meet her and then she never stops talking. She loves having her picture taken - singing and dancing and doing little shows. The pageants sheaposs been doing for the last year have brought her on loads with her confidence and itaposs lovely watching her on stage performing. Marcy has quite a feisty edge to her but Princess Charlotte has too - theyaposre like your modern-day princesses. Iaposve showed Marcy pictures of her and said aposthis is who people think you look likeapos. She thinks sheaposs nice but doesnapost have that awareness yet of looking like somebody .    Marcy is always full of fun and adventure and always wanting to know everything thataposs going on.

Becki Van der Land is looking forward to meeting both babies despite discovering weeks into her weekend that one would not make it.Becki and her husband Cees were overjoyed to learn that they were expecting both a son and a daughter earlier this year, reports the Chronicle Live .But at the -week scan the couple, from Allendale, Northumberland, were told the girl twin was much smaller than her brother and showing signs of struggling. Tragically, her heart stopped beating five weeks later due to a genetic translocation.    As well as coping with the death of daughter, the devastating news also meant that Becki, , was at risk of losing the boy baby as well. But after more anxious weeks, he is growing well, and the plan is for dental technician Becki to carry both babies to full term. Sheaposll be born at the same time as her brother, hopefully in four monthsapos time, said Becki. It shouldnapost impact the birth too much, except psychologically. Iaposm feeling really positive - itaposs what you make of it, so itaposs still a very positive experience. Itaposs going to be the only time we get to spend any time with her.    Becki and Cees, an earth sciences lecturer at Newcastle University, had dreams of starting a family when they married two years ago. It was part of our wedding vows to have children, and we were thinking three, said Becki. Their dream came true for the first time  months ago when she gave birth to their daughter Ottilie. Becki said: Then we were ecstatic to find out we were expecting boy girl twins earlier this year. I sort of knew straight away it was twins because it felt completely dferent to my daughter. I also had a strange feeling that something wasnapost quite right.    On the first scan they both looked perfect, but at  weeks the little girl looked smaller, so we had scans every week. They said she was showing signs of struggling and was quite a bit smaller than her brother. What followed was two months of tests at the Fetal Medicine Unit at Newcastleaposs Royal Victoria Infirmary. Unfortunately at  weeks the family learned that the little girlaposs heart had stopped beating. They have since found out that she had chromosomal translocation called q-qter deletion syndrome and had lost her IGFR gene, which meant she had severe interuterine growth restriction. Becki said: Grieving for your lost baby whilst still carrying her and her co-twin is a bittersweet and unexpected situation to find yourself in. We were really upset but at the same time we were in quite a privileged position in that we had time to prepare ourselves for the sad news. The death of a twin puts you at high risk of also losing the surviving co-twin so we were again warned to prepare for the worst.    But I am still pregnant and growing rapidly with our surviving boy twin. He is thankfully looking strong and healthy. Carrying le and death now continues to make this pregnancy very special but in a completely dferent way to what we envisaged. We still talk about our girl twin as much as we do our boy twin. We have chosen their names which we look forward to announcing after they are born, just as we would have donewe hadnapost lost our girl. Becki and Cees are now raising money in their daughteraposs memory for the refurbishment of the counselling rooms at the RVIaposs Fetal Medicine Unit. She said: We canapost thank all the staff enough. Their care made the world of dference at one of the worst times of our lives. And on Saturday keen runner Cees, who is a member of Tyne Bridge Harriers, is taking part in The Spine Race - a non-stop, seven day,  mile race from Derbyshire to the Scottish Borders. Becki said: All sponsorship received will go towards the costs of refurbishing the counselling rooms. Their aim is to to make them softer in decoration with sympathetic lighting, furniture and artwork to create a homely setting. Contributing will also leave a little legacy for our girl twin who we wonapost get to take home with her brother but who we will never forget.To donate click here."},{"url":null,"title":"parents spend more 1200 keeping","story":"NewsParents spend more than £, keeping their teens amused over summer holidaysMore than four in  parents admitted being ‘worried’ about affording a summer’s worth of entertainment for their familyShareCommentsByRichard Jenkins:,  JUN NewsResearchers discovered taking children on day trips, buying video games and magazines, and the extra cost of childcare will set mum and dad back £ over the six-week break\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailParents face a bill of more than £, keeping their teens amused during the summer holidays, a study has found. Researchers discovered taking children on day trips, buying video games and magazines, and the extra cost of childcare will set mum and dad back £ over the six-week break. And they’ll shell out more than £ per child just on food and drinks, including meals out, lunches during trips, as well as snacks and treats. The average summer holiday, either in the UK or abroad, will set families back a further £. per teen. More than four in  parents admitted being ‘worried’ about affording a summer’s worth of entertainment for their family. It also emerged nearly a quarter of a parent’s income goes on entertaining their teen over the long summer holiday, in a survey of , parents of teens aged - who are in education.    Chris Brown, director of sales programme recruitment at National Citizen Service– a three to four week summer programme which helps --year-olds gain confidence, build le skills and become more active citizens in their communities, said: “Our research has highlighted an issue for many parents across the country who are unsurprisingly worried about the cost of the summer holidays. “With the long break fast approaching, parents want to ensure that their teens are spending their time productively, without breaking the bank. The study also found the phrase parents fear most – “I’m bored” - is likely to be first uttered just eight days into the holidays – with fteen per cent of parents hearing it after three days or earlier.  This is despite kids being treated to special, yet expensive, day trips nearly nine times each over this summer’s six-week school vacation. Panicked mums and dads also admit to running out of ways to keep their child entertained only two-thirds of the way through the summer holidays. And it’s felt by the teens too, with four in  teenagers admitting they get bored over the school break. Another six in  admitted they want their summer holiday to be aposproductiveapos, while more than half also wished there was aposmore to doapos over the summer holidays. The research also revealed it takes less than three weeks for parents to hit breaking- point and wish their teens would hurry up and go back to school. One in ten parents admitted they don’t know how to advise their teen to make the most of the summer holidays.  Three in  worry their child will waste hours on social media and  per cent don’t think they will get enough fresh air. Half of the parents polled also admitted being concerned that their child will ‘waste’ the entire summer, according to the OnePoll research. Ellie Smith, mother of NCS participant Bradley Smith, , said: “Like many of the parents surveyed, I always wanted to make sure that Bradley was spending his school holiday productively. “I can definitely relate to the  per cent who admitted to being ‘worried’ about affording a summer’s worth of entertainment. “We didn’t have the money to send Bradley on a big residential trip or pay for lots of small activities so when the opportunity to go on NCS came up, it was ideal. Ellie, , of Bradford, West Yorkshire added: “NCS is a fantastic and financially feasible way for parents to ensure that their children have a fun, productive summer without having to spend hundreds of pounds. “I’ve seen a huge change in Bradley since his time on the programme - it was le changing for both of us.” Chris Brown added: “With summer holidays set to cost parents over £,, programmes such as NCS can help them not only save money, but also ensure their teens are spending the summer building skills that can help them in the future.”Places are still available for - year olds to take part in NCS.

A thunderstorm weather warning remains in force for almost all of England - apart from the south-west - and north-east and central Wales. Earlier a storm alert was issued for north-east, east, central, south and south-east England tomorrow. There is a chance of flooding in the areas affected by the weather warnings.

Spray and flooding could lead to dficult driving conditions and some road closures.  Things will start to pick up on Wednesday as the country basks in sunshine. The mercury should rise to around C in south England, C in south Wales and C in parts of Scotland. Thursday looks set to be a gloriously sunny day for the whole of the UK, although it will not be quite as hot as the weekend, with the mercury rocketing from Friday onwards. The weekend heatwave will take hold on Friday as temperatures soar to C in London and then reach C on Saturday. The scorching heat in the south-east will subside on Sunday, dropping back down to a maximum of C, with theof cloud.  Met Office chief meteorologist Dan Suri previously said: “It’s going to feel much hotter for most areas across the UK this week. Our latest forecasts show the highest temperatures are expected towards the end of the week, most likely across central and southwest England, where temperatures could rise into the low s Celsius. “This will be in stark contrast to the low temperatures we’ve had  so far this June .  It’s also going to feel humid and quite muggy - especially at night time - as temperatures could remain in the high teens or low s Celsius in places. Whilst some places within warning areas could miss thunderstorms altogether and enjoy a warm, bright day, where they do develop torrential downpours, hail, lightning and gusty winds are likely and a few spots could see as much as -mm of rain in one hour – which is very unusual for the UK.

But she and multiple other victims were exploited in a scam which earned the brothers £.million in five years. Police eventually found more than  men and women cooped up in a three-bedroom terraced house in Barking, east London, which was infested with cockroaches. There was a curtain in the middle of the room where they had beds and the curtain was separating the couples from the men, the woman, who was recruited from a bar in Romania, said.    I said four because in fact there were many more and I was never sure of the names.

Natasha Biran, from Manchester, had moved to Israel in August , where she met her husband Yair and now they have two children, Maoz, five, and two-year-old Geshem. Natasha has always loved travel and even went to the University of Birmingham to do a degree in American Studies, because it included a sandwich year away in Arizona, USA. In May , Natashaaposs father died and the family of four took a sudden and expensive trip to England for his funeral. The visit inspired them to want to travel the world with their two children in tow. The couple were both already working and making money online as translators, editors and writers and so were in the perfect position to become digital nomads.    A digital nomad is someone who can make their living online and so is free to move where they wish, thus being location independent, but internet dependent. I love peace and quiet but Iaposm also really sociable. The most important thing to me is to live my le with gratitude and love, Natasha said. Iaposve always loved travelling. I chose my degree in American Studies with Literature, History and Politics based on the sandwich year in Arizona, USA. It was the best decision ever. We spent a small fortune flying to England for his funeral and from there our journey just began on its own.  We didnapost make any special steps to save money to pay for our travels but we make enough monthly to cover all of our costs. Besides being a full-time mum, Iaposm also a part-time translator, editor and writer. Yair and I work together and all our work is done online. This gives us the flexibility to work and travel. Since the family left Israel they have travelled to England, Germany, Thailand, Sri Lanka and India. One of the biggest lessons of their travels has been how to keep their relationship strong while being around each other all day, every day. Theyaposve improved their communication skills and learnt to take time out for themselves. I think the main challenge of our lestyle choice is when Yair and I have our moments. Weaposre really committed to creating a harmonious environment for the family but naturally when we spend most of our time together, conflicts do arise.  The children have adapted amazingly. They love travelling. Geshem was really little when we started travelling so this is just le as she knows it. Maoz tells me he wants to travel forever. He has been on a total inner journey, heaposs become really flexible and open. The journey has created so much space for meaningful interaction between our children and their relationship has really developed, they are really close and share a lot of love and fun together. I home school my children on the road. This is also known as road-schooling and thereaposs a strong element of un-schooling weaved in there. Maoz is only five and back in Israel kids donapost actually start school until they are six years old. Theyaposre both really sociable and curious about the world and learn so much from all the experiences and people they meet along the way.    She added: We donapost know how long we will keep travelling for, we are always checking in with ourselves that our hearts are leading us and that our actions feel right for us as a family. Weaposve learnt not to make any sweeping statements about the future as we never know what will happen. We live a lot in the present and usually book our flights to new places about a week before we travel. Our family have been supportive, but they really miss us. We equally miss them a lot too and really hope theyaposll come visit us soon. You can travel the world without tons of money.

The first full week of summer will be blistering in countries including Spain, France and Germany while the UK bakes in its hottest weather of the year. Very hot air from Africa is being pulled north over Europe, where much of the mainland will see at least one day of intense heat and high humidity will make it feel more like C. The hottest temperatures are expected in Paris, Madrid, Prague, Munich and Zurich, with temperatures expected to hit C in Spain, according to forecasters. Meanwhile temperatures could rise towards the mid s in the UK as hot weather threatens to spawn violent thunderstorms.    Britons heading abroad to central and western Europe this week or next weekend will endure even hotter temperatures. Temperatures will peak at C in Madrid on Thursday and Friday, and close to C in places such as Paris and Majorca. Forecasters have issued warnings and some cities have implemented emergency plans to help residents cope with the heat, especially those who donapost have air conditioning in their homes. In France, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo activated a heatwave action plan, and the countryaposs health minister, Agnes Buzyn, has told councils, hospitals and care homes to be prepared.    Last summeraposs heatwave killed , more people than usual in July and August. A severe heatwave in July and August  - described as the worst since  by meteorologists - resulted in almost , heat-related deaths in France. That summer, Paris hit a record high of .C, and temperatures are expected to near that mark this week, France  reported. Meteorologist Francois Gourandof Meteo-France, told reporters: We are expecting a heatwave that will affect more than half of France, of maximum intensity: the hottest day reached will be comparable to , not very far away in any case.    He said June temperature records are likely to be broken, adding: This heatwave promises to be unprecedented for a month of June. Paris has more than  cool places open to the public - including swimming pools and museums - and more than  of them will be open at night for those looking to escape the heat. Nights will be very warm, and it will be at least a week before there is relief from the heat. While most of France endures extreme heat, temperatures will be below normal in Normandy and Brittany, where thunderstorms are a risk.  Temperatures this week will be close to C in Milan, Rome and parts of Germany, including Frankfurt and Berlin, and in the mid s in Prague, Vienna, Brussels and Zurich. German forecaster Dominik Jung told Bild: “Three days in a row with up to  degrees. And in June. That hasn’t happened before. The Saharan nozzle blows its hot air directly to us. And the sun is at its highest so temperatures can build for longer.” Public health officials have told people to take precautions to stay cool and advised against drinking alcohol during the heatwave, which poses a particular threat to children and the elderly. The German tabloid Bild suggested people have a siesta in the afternoons and put their pyjamas in the freezer to help them stay cool at night.  The unusually warm weather is due to a storm stalling over the Atlantic Ocean and high pressure over central and eastern Europe, AccuWeather said. It added: Locations from Madrid to Paris, Belgium, Frankfurt and Berlin can expect a multi-day heat wave, with daily temperatures near or above C . The highest temperatures of the year so far are expected during this heat wave in cities such as Madrid, Milan, Prague, Munich and Zurich. The heatwave began in Spain on Sunday, with temperatures hitting C in Madrid, and it will spread into France on Monday.  AccuWeather said: By Tuesday, intense heat will be felt from Madrid to Berlin and Milan. In the UK, temperatures are forecast to rise to C in the south-east of England by Friday. Thunderstorms will batter parts of the country this week. The conditions have pulled very hot air from Africa over Europe, said AccuWeather, which has warned of a potentially dangerous heatwave. Scientists say climate change has made extreme heatwaves in Europe up to five times more likely to occur. In India, at least  people have died in a heatwave that has sent temperatures soaring to C this month.

Especially here, where they have an extensive menu dedicated to them categorised by flavour and even offer “cocktail experiences” for those looking to learn from their mixologists. Our waiter recommended a real fruit mocktail with lots of real crushed fruit and berries and juices to provide a thirst quenching mix without the alcohol .We relaxed into the quiet and sipped our drinks in the sun as we pondered over the vast menu options.The venue’s interior is a mix of classic wooden floors with soft leathers and muted tartans in greys and brown, combining traditional charm with modern comfort. vw, px\"  The menus are bound in heavy leather books, and there was plenty of choice.My other half ordered bruschetta to startwhich, of course, we ended up sharing. Well, I am eating for two!Who knew that three simple slices of toasted bread with oils and tomato could be so delicious  Also, both of us were pretty in awe of the little yellow tomatoes – spot the uncultured pair.I toyed with the idea of my usual steak pie-pick and even deliberated a fish dish, but in the end we both went for the same main course of chicken tikka curryand it was presented beautully.The plate held rice and naan with a small dish of mango chutney and a large dish of gorgeously bright-coloured chicken tikka.The chicken was wonderfully soft and the tikka sauce was full of flavour, not too salty with just a bit of zing. vw, px\"  I’m notoriously soft when it comes to anything spicy, but this was just enough for me and I only needed water for my tingly lips towards the end of finishing the plateful.We were both equally surprised at the portion size from the Caird. Although it felt upmarket, there was no scrimping on the food.I chose the brownie for dessert and my partner the sticky toffee pudding . Again, both platefuls looked almost too good to eat.My dark chocolate brownie was topped with drizzled caramel sauce next to a scoop of vanilla ice cream with sprinkles of crushed chocolate and chocolate sauce. Strawberries and homemade fudge was presented to the side in a design with shards of wafer and small dollops of salted caramel and strawberry mousse. It sounds like a lot of flavours and it was, but in a good way.My partner’s slab of sticky toffee pudding was also teamed with a large scoop of ice cream, crushed chocolate, a large wafer and a couple of raspberries, sprinkled with icing sugar.We both finished the lot.The whole evening was lovely and relaxing. We could hear the live musicians in the bar from where we were seating which provided great listening.

Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next.

This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert. With a number of races omitted due to protests, it was a nice easy start for Glenn.The Hunter s and Sonatas saw a spread of results after some close racing.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

The sanctions, re-imposed after Mr Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal, have crippled the Iranian economy and pushed up the cost of living. Iran has decried US sanctions, which essentially bar it from selling its oil internationally, as ldquoeconomic terrorism.Mr Pompeo, considered a hard-liner in Washington, referred to Iran as ldquothe worldrsquos largest state sponsor of terror before he embarked on the hastily arranged Middle East stops on his way to India, Japan and South Korea.--vw,vw,px, px\"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo exits the plane at sunset as he arrives in Abu Dhabi --He said he would be speaking with leaders in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ldquoabout how to make sure that we are all strategically aligned, and how we can build out a global coalition hellip not only throughout the Gulf states, but in Asia and in Europe that is prepared to push back against Iran.But Germany, France and Britain, as well as Russia and China, remain part of the nuclear accord that lted sanctions on Iran in exchange for set limits on its uranium enrichment levels.

They cautioned against moves that can lead to conflict between the US and Iran.--vw,vw,px, px\"Iranian merchants conduct their business at a carpet market of the old main bazaar in Tehran, Iran --Berlin appears cool toward US talk of a global coalition against Iran as it tries to salvage the nuclear deal. German media have drawn parallels between Mr Pompeorsquos talk of a coalition and President George W.

He said the US doesnrsquot ldquoeven need to be there because it produces much of its own energy needs.Brian Hook, the US special envoy for Iran, said one option could be to ldquoenhance an existing multinational maritime force of about  countries that currently fights drug and arms smuggling in the region.Alternatively, he said allied nations with commercial interests in the oil-rich region could launch an all-new maritime security initiative.Another option could be military ships patrolling the Gulf waters and equipped with surveillance equipment to keep watch on Iran.The narrow Strait of Hormuz, which lies between Iran and Oman and opens to the Persian Gulf, is paramount for Asian oil importers.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour. Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me.

It seems to have been forgotten that part of the reason for Brexit was that the UK economy was paying in far more to Brussels than we got out. Conversely, Scotland was awarded a larger share of this money. If Scotland were independent, and wanted to rejoin the European Union, we would be asked to contribute more than we get out because Nicola Sturgeon has emphasised just how \"wealthy\" Scotland really is.

Transport emissions increased by .% between  and , mainly due to an increase in emissions from road transport.In fact, while transport emissions as a whole have increased by .% between  and , road transport emissions have increased by .%. This is due to a growth in activity over the period offset partly by improvements in the efficiency of vehicles.To put these figures in context, we are living and working in a time that is post declaration of a climate change emergency. Our government has reacted by committing to Scotland becoming net-zero emissions by .These statistics are entirely unacceptable.Ralph Roberts is Vice Chair of CPT ScotlandAs citizens of Scotland we all need to play our part and consider carefully how we expect to travel, heat our homes and generally consume. Meanwhile, our political leaders need to be prepared to make brave decisions and re-evaluate how transport is funded and delivered.Within this evaluation public transport ndash particularly by bus ndash has to be at the forefront of our thinking. Not as a problem to tackle but as a solution to embrace.Buses are the first target for Scotlandrsquos LEZs. They are among the biggest vehicles on the road. They must be to blame.In fact, buses are responsible for % of greenhouse gas emissions from road transportand the sector is investing heavily to further reduce that figure. Indeed, % of the UK bus fleet is zero emission already.The case for bus use is even stronger when you consider emissions on a per passenger basis. One full bus can replace  cars on the road.Cities that prioritise buses, cycling and walking reap societal benefits in terms of improvements in health, inclusion, accessibility. Research suggests that every pound invested in bus priority measures generates up to pound in wider benefits. Investing in bus transport is also good for the local economy. Cities such as Utrecht and Copenhagen, with their progressive sustainable transport focus, have disproved the myth that the car is vital for the high street.It is already the case more people access Scotlandrsquos town centres by bus than any other mode and spend pound per trip on average.However, bus use is falling as our road network becomes ever more congested. Many of these lost journeys will be people reverting to cars. Reversing this trend ndash thereby reducing road transport related emissions and capturing the benefits of bus growth ndash should be a priority for our policy makers. is a reasonable distance away but work to accomplish this has to start nowwe hope to change the national mindset.A paradigm sht is required.We need to introduce an evolution of the narrative around how we should expect to use our road space. This should be driven by central government and cascaded to local communities.Once the narrative takes hold, the introduction of the changes required becomes a much less contentious issue. The introduction of the smoking ban following the Smoking, Health and Social CareAct  is an example of how this approach can succeed.With regards to transport, government should invest in infrastructure that prioritises sustainable and active modes. Make walking, cycling and bus all viable and attractive options before restricting car use.Sweden recently added two words to the national vocabulary: flygskamand taringgskry . These encapsulate the recognition on the environment of our travel choices.I do not want to endorse environmental shaming but can we all really justy every car trip we take  Taking the bus should be a badge of pride.To its credit, the Scottish government is investing heavily on the rail network to lower emissions and improve journey times. Now is the time to similarly invest in bus infrastructure, particularly given that % of all public transport trips in Scotland are taken by busDirect public investment towards those that are making choices in line with Government policy on climate change. If this really is a climate emergency, we need to see a change in thinking and that starts at the top.Ralph Roberts is Vice Chair of CPT Scotland"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10033875.jpg?type=article-full","title":"john-prescott-tony-blairs-bruiser","story":"John Prescott, who has suffered a stroke, was one of the most recognisable politicians following labours landslide election win in , serving as deputy Prime Minister until .: John Prescott suffers strokeHis gruff, northern delivery was also a gt to satirists who mocked his occasionally mangled syntax and poor grammar.Prescott in Born in Prestatyn, Wales n , he was the MP for Hull East for  years from  to , and was forever associated with the north of England town.Starting out in in the Merchant navy as a waiter and steward on a Cunard liner, he was introduced to left-wing politics and trade union activism and left to pursue further education at Ruskin College and later the University of Hull.During his time in government he was for four years Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions - a massive portfolio which saw him butting heads with rail franchise owners due to his longstanding opposition to privatisation, although it was not reversed.:Prescott goes north to put his weight behind the No campaign#He was also instrumental in the UKs part in the drawing up of the Kyoto protocols to cut greenhouse gases, although his stated attempts to cut car use in favour of public transport failed.Prescotts time as environment secretary also saw one of the biggest faux pas, when he and we Pauline were caught out by the newspapers being driven  yards from their hotel to the venue of the Labour Party Conference.His reply to questions on the subject - that his we didnt like to get her hair blown about by the wind - led to widespread mockery and earned the MP the nickname \"Two Jags\" .On the campaign trail with we Pauline .Attempts to reform local government in England also floundered when he tried to bring in Regional Assemblies for the North.

This could take the form of increased headage payments under the existing beef calf support scheme.The SBA, along with NFU Scotland and other industry stakeholders, have been pressing Mr Ewing on the issue and SBA chairman, Neil McCorkindale, was hoping for an announcement by the Cabinet Secretary at the event.This didn’t materialise but Mr Ewing indicated he was sympathetic to the plea and accepted the argument that headage payments would be a more effective approach than area based support which would simply encourage inertia in the industry.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Mackies ice cream is used in Bubble Teas\"  Asian Tea Craze helps Mackie’s scoop record salesviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"CLAN Cancer Support\"  Lottery grant for cancer charity viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"garioch sc launches new children s activities programme","story":"Garioch Sports Centrethis week announced that it islaunching GSCkids, a new programme of children#s activities, in a bid to make children#s activities more accessible in the local area.Launching on Wednesday, August , children will still be able to enjoy their favourites, including additional football classes, and some new additions including Junior Boxercise.GSC will also be offering preschool gymnastics classes in partnership with Donside Gymnastics for the very first time.Sandra Simpson of Donside Gymnastics commented: “We’re delighted to be launching five brand new preschool gymnastics classes at Garioch Sports Centre. “Classes are suitable from .- years old and are the \u2028perfect pathway into our school-age gymnastics programme.”Garioch Sports Centre’s Kevin Bonarius, chief operating officer, added: ‘The aim of GSCkids is to provide a safe and inclusive environment for local children and their families and carers to enjoy active lestyles while having fun.“Our doors are open to children of all ages and abilities.

Bailies of Bennachie outreach officer Fiona Cormack said: “It was a special moment to have everyone joined together around the top of the hill.“Participants sang along to the sound of the Kintore Pipe Band playing Scotland the Brave, Flower of Scotland and Auld Lang Syne.“Some did a Mexican wave, others swung arms and some took a little time to reflect on their reasons for doing the walk.“One family from New South Wales in Australia took part and there was great support for this community event from the towns and villages around Bennachie.”“Mither Tap means ‘mother’s breast’ and that led us to raise money for breast cancer care and the University of Aberdeen Development Trust’s research into cures for breast cancer through this event.“We know that many people who have been affected by the disease took part in the walk.”One of the participants, Kate Brosman from Daviot, said she was last up Bennachie after her diagnosis and before her treatment.She explained: “I promised myself that I would come back once I was through the other side. It has been a while and I wasn’t sure that I would make it to the top but I was just up in time for the bosie and feel I have parked the whole experience there.”Funds raised will be spilt after costs between the two breast cancer charities and the Aberdeen Mountain Rescue Trust who provided marshals on the day.The Kemany Scout group also came out to help with members assisting with car parking and marshalling. data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Gerry Stephens, Financial Director for Mackies of Scotland, Cllr Anne Simpson, Aberdeenshire Councils Culture and Sport sub-committee vice-chair, Cllr Gillian Owen, Aberdeenshire Councils Education and Childrens Services Committee chair, Cllr Anne Stirling, Aberdeenshire Councils Communities Committee chair and author Vivian French\"  Scoop up books to win ice cream prize viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"After the bosie walkers ed to the field at the Back of Bennachie where they rested in the sunshine and enjoyed pizza, ice cream and coffee and cakes provided by local caterers.

This year local Scottish Fire and Rescue team will once again have a fire engine at the clinic to help draw attention to the clinic.Councillor Drever added: #The safety checks are carried out by a specially trained Good Egg Safety expert, not police officers # so people should not feel they are at risk of getting into trouble.“Rather it#s an opportunity to get some reassurance that your car seat is compatible with your vehicle, and to get tips and advice on any adjustments that would improve the car seat’s performance. We#d urge anyone who drives children about # whether that#s childminders, grandparents and parents or wider friends – to drop into the clinic. It is five or ten minutes of your time well spent.”The Good Egg Safety Child Seat clinic will be held in the Tesco car park in Kirkwall on Wednesday July , running from am to pm. There#s no need to book — just look for the Good Egg rep in the Tesco foyer, or head for the red fire engine.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They want to hear from the owners of all kinds of properties, from urban studio flats to historic country piles. From Shetland to Stranraer and Orkney to Oban, prime properties from all over Scotland will be in the frame.Jo Street, commissioner for BBC Scotland, said: “We’re delighted to announce a second series of Scotland’s Home of the Year. It isn’t just about showing off million-pound properties – it’s about truly celebrating what people have done to turn their house into a home, expressing their iniduality through their design, flair and imagination. We saw some cracking houses over the course of series one and there are far more gems to uncover for series two.”The first series of Scotland’s Home of the Year was broadcast on the new BBC Scotland channel in April and May this year.The series has since seen its audience continue to grow on iPlayer with requests to view so far hitting more than a quarter of a million – ,.The format saw three judges – architect Michael Angus, interior designer Anna Campbell-Jones and lestyle blogger Kate Spiers – travel theand breadth of Scotland to discover architectural gems and unearth some stunning interiors. Both traditional and contemporary properties were put under the microscope and judges considered everything from a one-bedroom apartment to a centuries-old country castle … and everything in between.Each home was scored on ality, distinctiveness and clever design and from seven finalists, one clear winner of series one was chosen – the White House in Kirkcudbright, Dumfries and Galloway, created by proud owner Lesley Smith and her late husband Mike.Series two will have a slightly longer run than series one with nine -minute heats, each featuring three properties from a specic part of the country. The  houses featured will then be whittled down to a final nine which will go under the spotlight in an hour-long final episode.Gerard Costello, executive producer, IWC Media said: “We are thrilled that Scotland’s Home of the Year is ing to the BBC Scotland channel. The first series was a joy to make and we have only scratched the surface of the beautul and distinctive homes Scotland has to offer. We can’t wait to get started.”If you’d like to be considered for the next series of Scotland’s Home of the Year, you can get in touch at scotlandshomes@IWCMedia copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Providing practical training for riders where they can improve their skills and understanding of risks through controlled exercises is a vital part of this strategy.“Motorcyclists are vastly over-represented in serious road injuries, so I hope that Orkney’s motorcyclists will take up this opportunity to both become a safer road user and improve their overall riding experience through better bike handling skills.”Anyone interested in attending the course should email: operationriderrefinement@scotland.pnn.police.ukcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Not content with writing just one book, he decided to author two: one will be the scuttle story in photographs, From Scuttle to Salvage, which will be launched this Thursday, June . The  other, The Last Days of the High Seas Fleet, is the more in depth story of the German Naval mutiny, and how the Fleet came to be interned in Scapa. Both are on sale at the Orcadian Bookshop.As with Jutland, Nick decided to tell the story in film. He is passionate about passing history on to his childrens’ generation, and says he felt that this would be a best way of reaching younger people who prefer video to text. The -minute animation has already been seen by more than , people online, and was made possible through crowdfunding and the help of numerous museums and archives, the Kirkwall Library and Archives being among them.Nick will be talking about the scuttle on June  at pm at the St Magnus Centre, where with him, many of the descendants will participate.

The hope is that will lead to a groundswell that brings others to the fold.In recent years, the party has relied most on big-dollar donors, who have written massive cheques. Mr Trump has been an exception and was propelled through the Republican primary and into the White House in  on a wave of small-dollar contributions.Republicans hope WinRed will be the dominant one-stop shop that pulls small-dollar donors in mdash and then persuades them to give to other candidates farther down the ballot.ldquoWinRed is an important first step in levelling the playing field in the small-dollar donor race, said senator Todd Young, chairman of the partyrsquos Senate campaign committee. ldquoA unied GOP fundraising  will allow us to harness the enthusiasm for President Trumprsquos agenda, build a long-term small-dollar network and win in .That may be easier said than done.

The US has been building up its military presence in the Persian Gulf.Productive meeting with King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud today to discuss heightened tensions in the region and the need to promote maritime security in the Strait of Hormuz. Freedom of navigation is paramount. pic efuZqEOpKmdash Secretary PompeoJune , The US announced additional sanctions Monday on Iran aimed at pressuring the Iranian leadership into talks. The sanctions, re-imposed after Mr Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal, have crippled the Iranian economy and pushed up the cost of living. Iran has decried US sanctions, which essentially bar it from selling its oil internationally, as ldquoeconomic terrorism.Mr Pompeo, considered a hard-liner in Washington, referred to Iran as ldquothe worldrsquos largest state sponsor of terror before he embarked on the hastily arranged Middle East stops on his way to India, Japan and South Korea. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo exits the plane at sunset as he arrives in Abu Dhabi--He said he would be speaking with leaders in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ldquoabout how to make sure that we are all strategically aligned, and how we can build out a global coalition hellip not only throughout the Gulf states, but in Asia and in Europe that is prepared to push back against Iran.But Germany, France and Britain, as well as Russia and China, remain part of the nuclear accord that lted sanctions on Iran in exchange for set limits on its uranium enrichment levels. Mr Trump pulled the US out of the deal last year.Germany, Britain and France have sent envoys to Tehran recently, signalling they remain committed to diplomacy and dialogue. They cautioned against moves that can lead to conflict between the US and Iran. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Iranian merchants conduct their business at a carpet market of the old main bazaar in Tehran, Iran--Berlin appears cool toward US talk of a global coalition against Iran as it tries to salvage the nuclear deal. German media have drawn parallels between Mr Pompeorsquos talk of a coalition and President George W. Bushrsquos ldquocoalition of the willing against Iraq in , which Germany and France opposed.German foreign ministry spokesman Christofer Burger said his country had ldquotaken note via the media of Mr Pompeorsquos comments and that Germanyrsquos ldquotop aim is and remains a de-escalation of the serious situation.On Monday, Mr Trump tweeted that China and Japan depend on the security of the Persian Gulf waterways for the bulk of their oil imports, and he asked why the US is protecting the shipping lanes for other countries ldquofor zero compensation.ldquoAll of these countries should be protecting their own ships on what has always been a dangerous journey. He said the US doesnrsquot ldquoeven need to be there because it produces much of its own energy needs.Brian Hook, the US special envoy for Iran, said one option could be to ldquoenhance an existing multinational maritime force of about  countries that currently fights drug and arms smuggling in the region.Alternatively, he said allied nations with commercial interests in the oil-rich region could launch an all-new maritime security initiative.Another option could be military ships patrolling the Gulf waters and equipped with surveillance equipment to keep watch on Iran.The narrow Strait of Hormuz, which lies between Iran and Oman and opens to the Persian Gulf, is paramount for Asian oil importers. An estimated  million to  million barrels of oil, much of it crude, pass through the strait every day. -- vw,vw,px, px\"This map provided by the US department of defence shows the site where they say a US Navy RQ- drone was shot down--The US Navy, which has its th Fleet based in Bahrain to protect the strait, escorted oil tankers to ensure American energy supplies in the s when Iran and Iraq were targeting each otherrsquos exports, but the US is no longer as reliant on Arabian producers.Today, any conflict that threatens tankers would badly disrupt crude supplies for energy-hungry countries like China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Indonesia, which are among the top five importers of Arabian oil.After his meetings in Saudi Arabia with King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Mr Pompeo tweeted that he had a ldquoproductive meeting with the monarch and discussed ldquoheightened tensions in the region and the need to promote maritime security in the Strait of Hormuz.Mr Pompeo then travelled to neighbouring Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, another close US ally.The regional stops may be aimed at reassuring Washingtonrsquos Sunni Gulf Arab allies that the White House remains committed to keeping pressure on Shiite Iran following Mr Trumprsquos decision against retaliation, which likely raised questions about US willingness to use force against the Islamic Republic.-- vw,vw,px, px\"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo meets with Saudi Arabiarsquos Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman--On a visit to Israel on Sunday, US National Security Adviser John Bolton, also considered a US hard-liner, said Iran should not ldquomistake US prudence and discretion for weakness.Iranrsquos naval commander, Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi, declared that Tehran is capable of shooting down other American spy drones that violate its airspace, saying ldquothe crushing response can always be repeated. He spoke during a meeting of defence officials in Iran.Mr Trump has wavered between bellicose language and actions toward Iran and a more accommodating tone, including an offer for negotiations. Iran has said it is not interested in a dialogue with Mr Trump.One last visual: Red dot is the impact point of the trespassing drone against the border of Iran and the border of the United States. pic nqVYIEmkLmdash Javad ZarJune , Saudi Arabia and the US accused Iran of being behind attacks on tankers near the Persian Gulf in recent weeks, while the UAE has been urging diplomacy to avert a wider conflict.On the eve of Mr Pompeorsquos visit to the kingdom, Yemenrsquos Iranian-allied rebels attacked a Saudi airport near the Saudi-Yemen border, killing a Syrian resident and wounding  other civilians, the Saudi military said.The Houthi rebels claimed they used bomb-laden drones to attack the Abha airport, the second in less than two weeks. Drones were also used against a Saudi oil pipeline last month.Saudi Arabia has been at war with the rebel Houthis in Yemen for more than four years.

Admirers of the high art of comedy may be familiar with an especially brilliant sketch written and performed by David Mitchell and Robert Webb. The pair – dressed in Germany army unorms – are on a World War Two battlefield, preparing an attack. Webb’s character, puffed up and confident, puts down a field telephone, and declares, “They’re coming. Now we’ll see how these Russians deal with a crack SS ision.”As distant gunfire echoes, Mitchell’s character approaches, nervously clears his throat, and begins, “Hans…”“Have courage, my friend,” says Webb’s alpha.“Yeah, eh, Hans, I’ve just noticed something,” comes the reply.“These communists are all cowards.”“Have you looked out our caps, recently ” asks Mitchell’s beta.“Our caps ”“The badges on our caps, have you looked at them ”“What  No… a bit.”With an anguished look on his face, Mitchell’s character continues, “They’ve got skulls on them. Have you noticed that our caps have actually got little pictures of skulls on them ”“I don’t, um…”“Hans,” Mitchell’s soldier continues, tentatively, “…are we the baddies ”There is more to come and I urge you,you haven’t seen it, to seek out the sketch, online. It is masterful stuff that endures almost  years after it was first broadcast on the double act’s BBC Two sketch show.Perhaps what makes this sketch so timeless, beyond the excellence of the performances, is that it captures something with which we can all identy. Which of us hasn’t, at some crucial point in our lives, been stricken by a moment of crushing self-doubt  Which of us hasn’t wondered whether, maybe, we are in the wrong I watched the sketch again last week and it occurred to me that it could not be more relevant, right now.Self-examination has never been so unfashionable uncertainty is a weakness to be deplored . Among the political classes, absolute certainty must be maintained, even in the face of crushing evidence that destroys one’s assertions.Think of the bluster of former SNP leader, Alex Salmond, who led the war against nuance during ’s independence referendum campaign. Any dficult question about how he might oversee the break-up of the UK was dismissed by Salmond as part of a “Project Fear” campaign designed to terry voters who might not have believed independence to be in Scotland’s best interests. Salmond’s aggressive reaction to legitimate inquiry created a culture in the Yes campaign where the done thing was not to consider the question but to question the motives of the questioner. After all, since we could be certain that independence would be a very good thing with no downsides, anyone who suggested otherwise must have had malice in their hearts. Of course Scotland would retain its EU membership after voting Yes, insisted Salmond, in the face of remarks from the EU that contradicted him. Of course an independent Scotland would enter into a currency union with what was left of the UK, despite assurances from the then chancellor and his Westminster shadows that no such arrangement would or could take place. Of course Scotland, standing proudly alone, would be wealthy and prosperous, even though the price of North Sea oil – on which this assertion was based – was plummeting.This absolute certainty infected the Yes campaign which, often, mistook angry shouting for debate and went on to discover that it needed more than blind faith to persuade a majority of Scots to support the independence project.A year later, as Donald Trump ramped up his campaign to become American President, dangerous certainty reached a new, even more disturbing level. Evidence of Trump’s misdeeds – things like film and audio recordings and paperwork that, by any standard, proved he was unsuitable for the role he sought – was rejected by the candidate as “fake news” and his supporters, so utterly convinced that Trump would make good on his promise to “make America great again”, accepted his words as truth. To question Trump’s claims was to be a traitor.And in , the same characterisation of doubt as weakness proved invaluable to Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson as they bluffed their way to victory in the referendum on EU membership. Their every proclamation about “freedom” and “sovereignty” was accepted, without question, by their disciples. Self-reflection can be a painful business it’s hardly surprising that we are so uncomfortable about doing it. It’s so much easier to blame a former partner for the break down of a relationship than it is to consider whether our own behaviour might have played its part. It’s comforting to think that we missed out on a promotion because the interviewer had it in for us rather than because, maybe, another candidate was better suited. Over recent weeks, we’ve listened as contenders to become the next leader of the Conservative Party and, by extension, Prime Minister of the UK, have set out their “plans” to achieve Brexit where Theresa May failed. With the honourable exception of Rory Stewart, whose decision to engage with reality rather than to rely on fantasy ruled him wholly unsuitable for the \u2028job, these men relied on loud declarations of certainty to maintain their campaigns.The final two candidates – Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt– are still at it. They’re still telling us they can get a new deal out of the EU, even as the EU insists the withdrawal agreement struck with Theresa May is the only one available.Hunt and Johnson – or, more accurately, the parade of lickspittle MPs who have appeared in the media in his stead while he hides from scrutiny –continue to assert, with bullet-proofed certainty, that they have plans to make a success of Brexit when all the evidence says that they damned well do not.The certainty of politicians comes with a large dollop of nauseating moral superiority on top.

Only delivering Brexit on  October cannormality to British politicsExactly three years ago this morning I walked out of Milbank Tower, Westminster, after an all-night party arranged to take in the results of the UK’s EU referendum.I had a smile as bright as the dawn and wide as the Thames itself. We had only gone and done it the campaign to leave the European Union had blown the bloody doors off. British politics would never be the same again.I was always confident about the outcome of the referendum and repeatedly cheered-up my less optimistic colleagues that they were in the process of making history. Although behind in the polls for most of the campaign the cross-party and non-party coalition of Leave supporters had at least three advantages that gave us an underlying edge. The first was Prime Minister David Cameron had been poorly treated by the European Union’s political elite who stupidly dismissed his attempt to show he could win reforms. This was a serious political misjudgement by Merkel, Hollande, Juncker, Tusk and their aloof colleagues, displaying a symptomatic arrogance and condescension that continues to this day. Had they conceded deliverable reforms demonstrating a willingness to decentralise and loosen their inexorable drive towards ever closer union then the Leave campaign would have had a far harder fight on its hands.• : Nicola Sturgeon: Chances of no Brexit now more likelyAlthough Cameron’s shuttle diplomacy is mostly forgotten now its repudiation set the context in which the referendum would be played out – the British looking for the repatriation for more controlsagainst a European establishment who had stopped listening and paid only lip-service to keep troublesome natives docile.The second advantage was that there was not one campaign to Leave – but many. While Vote Leave eventually won the official designation to run the Leave campaign the competition to win the designation that came first from Leave.EUand latterly from Grassroots Out, meant there was not one strategy reaching out to voters but three. In addition, a long list of dedicated groups that had been campaigning for at least a generation, such as The Freedom Association, Bruges Group and Global Britain had been joined by the likes of Labour Leave to reach out to people that might otherwise have fallen off a centralised campaign grid. Together with UKIP members – a party originally founded by the Scot Professor Alan Sked in response to the Maastricht Treaty, and then made politically successful by Nigel Farage – they also provided boots on the ground that were willing to work with the many Conservatives who took the brave pills and opposed their leader and Prime Minister.It is thanks to the happenstance of this hydra-headed approach that the Leave result was achieved despite the official campaign, rather than because of it.• : Brexit deal is dead: Prepare for No Deal vs No Brexit – Brian WilsonThe third advantage was the solely negative approach taken by the Remain group, which learned nothing from the almost fatal negativity of the Better Together campaign in the Scottish referendum. After dropping any mention of Cameron’s fudged and worthless reforms George Osborne, Nick Clegg, George Carney and their lieutenants relied upon a constant feed of scaremongering and doom-laden reports, forecasts and supercharged extrapolations of unreliable predictions to frighten voters of what might come – not just in the future but “immediately following” a vote to leave. Just as many of the similar threats did not cut through in the Scottish referendum they failed dismally to motivate support for the European project that had been the common purpose of the global political elite and their civil servants since the Second World War. Even rolling out President Obama worked against British pugnaciousness. Most economic threats were seen as out of touch and simply not believed, but where they might have ben effective were still dismissed as irrelevant – people wanted control of their lives back. That is why cities such as Sunderland and Derby with their Nissan and Toyota car plants, or Redcar with its closing steel mill, still voted Leave – and still support it today.That the UK should go on to create over , new jobs in the following three years and maintain its lead in attracting Foreign Direct Investment ahead of Germany and Francedemonstrated who really lied in the referendum. Nor should we forget the Remain campaign outspent the Leave campaign by £.m to .m not counting the Government’s own pamphlet that cost £.m to print and distribute to m households before expenses rules kicked-in. The result was determined not by money but by having messages that chimed with what ious voters thought.The fallout since that day three years ago has been immense.Cameron broke his promise to stay only for another remainer, Theresa May, to replace him unchallenged. Her litany of broken promises are well recorded and I offer no sympathy for it must be understood, she dealt her own hand and then played it badly. It was she who relegated her government from a working majority to an imploding minority she who chose the strategy of repeated concessions over the advice of her ministers tasked with the negotiations and she who refused to listen when confronted with defeat, after defeat, after defeat.Instead of capitalising on the Conservative failure Jeremy Corbyn has preicated so often that Labour politicians compete to claim which direction he faces– Leave or Remain, second referendum or general election  Likewise the SNP has become trapped in the Leave headlights, fooling itself that Brexit can deliver independence rather than seeking to deliver a successful government.Having retired, believing his job was done, Nigel Farage has come back and formed the Brexit Party which has earned him the plaudit of bringing down two prime ministers without him even being in the House of Commons. Now he must hold the feet of Boris Johnson orJeremy Hunt to the fire.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left.

We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you are interested in adopting a dog please get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymenaAbandoned - SallyFatal road crash: Our hearts and prayers are with family, says MP Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":null,"title":"outdoors consultation","story":"MEA Council is planning to grow its provision for outdoor recreation over the next decade and want to hear what residents would or wouldn#t like to see happen in the borough.Outdoor recreation covers everything from clay pigeon shooting to walks, cycling, climbing, running and more.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party, and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assemblys suspension in . He was a frequent visitor to Ballymena during his time with the NIHE and he never failed tomention that he had married a Ballymena woman, Norah Caruth. Lady Gorman, passed away peacefully in Ringdufferin Nursing Home in .

At the time it was taken in the iconic Flamingo Ballroom, they were members of local rock’n’blues band, Tailor.The band was formed in the early s by Tucker McIlwee and John Tennant.“Other band members who played with Tailor over the years were Ronnie McAuley, Hubert Dunlop and Ricky Maybin, Henry McQuillan, Dave Moore Trevor Erwin andGerry McNeely. We were transported to and from the gigs by Brian Surgenor, ” says John.“Our first gig was at a place called Betty Staffs in Belfast but we travelled throughout Ireland playing most of the towns on the circuit.“Amazingly, we had never played in Ballymena until Sammy Barr of the Flamingo approached our manager to offer a booking.”It transpired that Tailor were playing on the same bill as Rory Gallagher. As you would expect, the group were excited but, in their own words, ‘not overwhelmed.’John remembers: “We met with Rory and his band during set up,. Rory was a very down to earth guy. We discussed what songs we were going to play as we were going to have a one hour set. The Flamingo was full to the brim, the crowd were electric and Tailor recieved a tremendous welcome.“Following the gig we met with Rory for the photo call. The rest is history. Tailor continued to travel theand breadth of Ireland entertaining the young and not so young ravers until the group members went their seperate ways after six years of traveling on the road.”After years of inaction the group reformed to play two gigs for Cancer research, The Countryman Inn and the Telecom Club were filled to capacity for the night of nostalgia and entertainment. pound was raised for charity.And John ponders: “Will the group do it again  Watch this space!”Rory Gallagherwas an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist,songwriter, and producer.Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the s and s, after forming the band Taste during the late s. His albums have sold over  million copies worldwide.Gallagher received a liver transplant in , but died of complications later that year in London at the age of .He began playing after school with Irish showbands, while still in his early teens. Having completed a musical apprenticeship and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early s, Gallagher formed The Taste, which was later renamed simply, Taste, a blues rock and RB power trio, in .Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the Marquee Club, supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert, and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America.After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name. The s were Gallaghers most prolic period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour . November  saw the release of the album Deuce. In the same year he was voted Melody Makers International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. He is documented in Irish Tour , a film directed by Tony Palmer.During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.

He told the : “This has been an ongoing campaign for me and my constituents who use this Junction sometimes on a daily basis .“ I first contacted DFI Roads some years ago in September  when they told me that due to recent collisions an investigation was under way. “They also informed me at that time they had a scheme proposal under development with a number of options being considered. “Writing back to them a year later in  DFI Roads then stated they hoped to be in a position to compete for funding in the next three years works programme which was being developed at the time. “By  we then managed to convince DFI Roads to put in place a number of additional measures at the junction. “New Junction warning signs and Slow markings were provided along with new enhanced signage on the Woodtown Rd.”Mr. Frew said that DFI Roads are now proposing to spend pound, on upgrading the junction although he did not specy an actual timeline of when the work will take place. He added: “ The primary aim is to change the junction priority from Woodtown Rd to Sand Rd to accommodate the predominant traffic movements. “This will also improve stopping sight distances throughout the approaches.

Rory McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and Darren Clarke, who will all now be competing in the tournament, feature in the design, alongside former Open Champion and Portrush man Fred Daly. Engaging the talents of Hollywood digital CGI artist Mike Campau, the tongue-in-cheek stunt has been designed to reflect how Northern is truly ‘Made for Golf’, illustrated not only by our sporting talents but also in our landscapes and rugged coast. The timing of the tribute could not be more fitting as Northern Ireland golfers celebrate their recent triumphs on the course, with Rory McIlroy winning the Canadian Open by seven shots to secure his th PGA Tour title and fellow Northern Irishman Graeme McDowellafter finishing tied eighth on  under.

Tourism NI Marketing Director Naomi Waite said: “With ‘Open fever’ beginning to take a hold, we wanted to honour the global golfing heroes who collectively have played a key role in bringing The th Open to Northern Ireland and, through their talent, have made Northern Ireland a growing international golf destination. It is just one of many activities we have planned to celebrate the enormous pride that the people of Northern Ireland have in the achievements of our golfing greats. “While Northern Ireland might one day boast its own ‘Mount Rushmore’ for golf, we can reassure everyone that this stunt is digital theatre and something we hope will raise a smile ahead of July.” Robin Daly, son of the late Fred Daly, said: “Our family are extremely honoured that my father is being remembered in this way. We are really looking forward to theof The Open to our shores for the first time in nearly  years and this sculpture is a wonderful tribute to the talents of these local sportspeople who have earned their place in the history book of golf.” McIlroy and McDowell will tee up at Royal Portrush alongside fellow local and former Open Champion, Darren Clarke, in front of a passionate home crowd when one of the world’s greatest sporting spectacles - The Open - s to the famous Dunluce links for the first time in nearly  years.

Parishioners and well-wishers packed into Corpus Christi Church for am Mass as the Springhill congregation came together to give thanks for Fr Des’ dedicated service to the West Belfast community.Parish Priest of Corpus Christi Fr Paddy McCafferty, who celebrated the special service, praised Fr Des’ “immense strength and dedication” within and to the community and said the depths of gratitude felt towards him are “immeasurable.” “Fr Des is a champion of the people, Fr Des saw was needed to be done and did it, he is a man without equal.”“Fr Des co-ordinated, instigated and educated the community. I’m almost lost for words when it comes to describing him. I was looking up the meaning of the word ‘platinum’, it means hard wearing, hard, Fr Des was rock hard in his work for the community. What would people have done without him ”On celebrating his Platinum Jubilee Fr Des said: “I never thought I would get this far.“There were more than  priests ordained the same day as I was, most of them are gone from this world, a mere handful of us laughing about which of us will reach the th birthday first.“What I want to do now, most of all is to thank God for allowing me to live among such good family, friends and neighbours during those years. You taught me what le means you taught me that especially during the bad, sad times. I believe we are seeing the beginning of a renewed Ireland, a renewed Christianity, a renewed city of Belfast – and we are privileged to live in one of the most beautul parts of the city – between the beautul mountain that is full of surprises like the feast of bluebells in the beginning of summer to the snow topped hills in winter, between the sweeping magnicent valley of the Lough and the Lagan,” he said. “This must surely be one of the most beautul places for a city to be in.”Fr Des continued: “This is where I learned the best lessons about le and I am grateful to family, friends, neighbours who taught me and even had great patience when I learned so slowly. I learned how good people show their dignity even during the hardest of times, show it most of all during the hard times. “So I am grateful to God for being here, grateful, to all whom I have had the privilege of being family and neighbour to. And very, very hopeful for the future.“Coming out of the worst of times we could now be facing into the best of times. May God and good people make it so. Father Paddy, like our friend Father Aiden, you are with us all at the beginning of a newly awakened Church and a people refreshed by what they have suffered and achieved together. We have good reason to be thankful for that and for each other.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"from detroit to north belfast how a big name does a big job","story":"TO say the name Kronk Boxing Gym is iconic in the sport would be an understatement. Located in Detroit and once led by trainer Emanuel Steward, the name is a household word in the sport of boxing.But North Belfast has its a Kronk Boxing Gym, located in the Duncairn Centre on Duncairn Avenue.Formed as Belfast ABC over  years ago by Bobby McAllister, one of the best coaches in Ireland at the time, the club has come a long way since.In December , former secretary of the gym, Damien McCann, played a pivotal role in Limerick boxer Andy Lee turning pro. He then negotiated a lucrative financial management agreement for Lee to turn professional with Emanuel Steward from the world renowned Detroit Kronk Boxing GymLee was Ireland’s rising amateur boxing star and when he beat USA champion, Jesus Gonzales in the semi-finals of the World Junior Championship, a new relationship between Steward and Kronk in Detroit was born with Belfast ABC gym, hence its name today, Kronk ABC Belfast.Past professional coach Tony Dunlop has been a key figure throughout the history of Kronk ABC Belfast and spoke about the club’s illustrious time.“This place started over  years ago when Bobby McAllister walked past the building which was derelict at the time and thought it would be perfect place for a boxing gym,” he explained.“He asked people in the community who were very positive and said that it would be great for young people in the area.“After a period of time, a lot of kids came through the doors. Ryan Burnettt and Paddy Barnes both started off here.“Burnett was groomed from his early days in here to become a superstar. He left here at  fights undefeated and was one of the best in the world at just  years old.“The turning point I suppose was when Emanuel Steward from Kronk gym in Detroit, which is the best gym in the history of boxing, got in touch.“He saw some of the work we were doing and Belfast Kronk Boxing Gym was born –the rest is history as they say.“We have continued to bring through a lot of champions including professionals James Tennyson and Daniel McShane.“Tommy McCarthy is also here now fighting professional.”Today, the club is going from strength to strength under the stewardship of a new breed of coaches in the shape of Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough.The duo have embarked on a new programme of coaching young people from North Belfast with the aim of using boxing to their benefit.Tony added: “Paddy Saunders and Martin McCullough are both fantastic coaches. They are flying the flag for Belfast Kronk Gym today.“They have started off a new programme with the youth of the area. They are both giving it a million per cent. I’ve never seen two coaches work as hard. Kronk Gym could not be in better hands.”Classes for - to -year-olds take place every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from .pm to .pm with classes for  years and older from .pm to pm on the same days.Paddy Saunders explained: “Many of the kids have behavioural problems and some suffer from autism.“These classes are an outlet and something to focus and concentrate on.“It is not all about boxing but something for them to do. They don’t miss classes.“If we get a few champions out of it, then brilliant, but it is for the kids.“Most boxing clubs don’t take kids at eight years old, but we do.“All the kids start off exercising and running about the big hall before they come into the boxing gym itself.“They are putting their energy into something positive instead of being on the street and engaging in vandalism and anti-social behaviour. I believe there is a bright future for boxing in North Belfast. We have a top-class facility and there are a lot of good kids in here.”To find out more about the club and to get involved, check out the new Kronk ABC Belfast Facebook page."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"local mla gets brexit safety alert","story":"POLICE have delivered an extraordinary advice list to the West Belfast home of a Sinn Féin MLA suggesting ways in which he can improve his and his family’s personal security post-Brexit.The document has already been delivered to the homes of all  MPs across the United Kingdom, but officers who called to the home of Máirtín Ó Muilleoir said they are widening distribution of the document to take in Brexit spokespersons of parties in the north. The leaflet – headlined ‘When It Goes Too Far’ – outlines steps that politicians should takethey are targeted by extremists in any wave of public unrest that may break out post-October , the latest deadline for the UK leaving the EU.The document – which Mr Ó Muilleoir yesterday branded “Brexit bollox – has been compiled by a number of UK agencies: the National Police Chiefs’ Council, the Crown Prosecution Service, the College of Policing and the Electoral Commission. Despite its wide experience in dealing with public unrest, the PSNI has not been involved in drawing up the guidelines. But local police officers have been tasked with distributing it to MLAs closely connected to the Brexit issue.To the fore in the security advice is what Mr Ó Muilleoir and his family should do in the event of being targeted with a hazardous substance. Police advice is to:• Leave the house and seek fresh air.• Treat itchy or painful skin with water.• Remove outer clothing – but not by pulling it over the head.• Remove any substance that may contact clothing or skin by using a dry absorbent material or brushing it off.Advice is also included on what signs may signal the presence of hazardous substances in the home.The leaflet also advises politicians not to engage with iniduals who may be “stalking harassing” them, either online or offline. It urges them to seek further advice on personal safety and building security from their local police force and to conduct a review of what personal information about them is available online.The leaflet explains that the advice is being forwarded for politicians to consultthey are subjected post-Brexit to “unacceptable levels of harassment and intimidation”. It continues: “In some cases, these behaviours and actions have reached the criminal threshold. The worst examples have led to violence and injury.”The most serious example of Brexit-inspired violence was the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox in June  in West Yorkshire by a gun- and kne-wieldingman holding extreme pro-Britain views. Mr Ó Muilleor said: “It seems preposterous to me that the PSNI is promoting Brexit security advice compiled at the behest of a UK government which for three years has shown itself so thoroughly inept in its handling of the issue. There’s little in this that isn’t already known to most people and no reason why it couldn’t have been emailed to me rather than dispatching a police patrol. There are Catholic families in my South Belfast constituency living under the jackboot of the UVF and the flegger bully-boys. The PSNI would be better advised to protect those folk rather than wasting their time and my time with this Brexit bollox.”"},{"url":null,"title":"9000 in northern ireland apply to secure status after","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

https:t.co QZTQcoK— Prosperity-UKJune , Its interim report recommends:– Investigating the possibility of creating special economic zones to cover the border.– Creating a multi-tier trusted trader programme for large and medium-sized companies, with exemptions for the smallest firms.– Using mobile units to carry out sanitary and phytosanitarychecks – covering food safety and plant and animal health – away from the border.– Drafting an alternative arrangements protocol which could be inserted into either the Withdrawal Agreement or used in any other Brexit outcome.The commission was chaired by Tory former ministers Nicky Morgan and Greg Hands.Treasury Select Committee chairwoman Mrs Morgan said: “The commission has met its three conditions: to uphold the vital Belfast-Good Friday Agreement to harness existing technologies and customs best practice, not any futuristic high-tech unicorns and to be compatible with any of the possible Brexit outcomes, including the existing Withdrawal Agreement.“A successful agreement and roll-out of alternative arrangements would supersede the need for the backstop.”But Owen Smith, former shadow Northern Ireland secretary and a supporter of the People’s Vote campaign for a second referendum, said: “The idea of trying to replace the Northern Ireland backstop with so-called alternative arrangements has already been tested to destruction.“There is no political will to do so from either Ireland, the rest of the EU or most importantly the people of Northern Ireland, particularly those living on or near the border.”He said the commission was “a desperate attempt to make a square peg fit into a round hole in order to try and hold the warring factions of the Conservative Party together”.Naomi Smith, head of the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign, said “a solution years down the line won’t cut it: we have a deadline of October  this year” and the proposals would “wrap the island of Ireland in red tape and bureaucracy – at a hefty cost to the British taxpayer”.“A quicker, cheaper and more efficient option would be to stop Brexit,” she said."},{"url":null,"title":"varadkar casts doubt on alternative arrangements plan for irish border","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

of Ireland and Northern Ireland .A new body of experts has been set up in the UK to look at potential alternative arrangements.Read MoreExtent of Irish north-south cooperation revealed in secret Brexit impact mapping exercise reportFuture PM seeking to delay Brexit would face EU hostility – VaradkarExpert  appointed to advise UK government on alternative arrangements for Irish border after BrexitMany Brexiteers believe technological solutions could replace the backstop. But Mr Varadkar said he could not see evidence of arrangements being outlined before the October  deadline for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market.Leo VaradkarThe Taoiseach made the remarks at the end of an EU summit in Brussels as European Council president Donald Tusk said Brexit would become “more exciting” than before with a change of British prime minister but that the EU’s position had not changed.Mr Varadkar said: “We can’t accept that alternative arrangements are an alternative to a backstop unless we can see what these alternative arrangements are, know how they would work and see them demonstrated.“That hasn’t been done yet and I don’t see that being done this side of October  which is why we certainly can’t accept the deletion of the backstop.”He added: “For us, a deal without a backstop is effectively no deal because it means that there is no legal guarantee we won’t have a hard border, there is no operable mechanism by which we can avoid a hard border, it would just be a case of trying to pull it off, which I don’t think really is much of a solution.”Mr Varadkar said EU leaders had reaffirmed that the Withdrawal Agreement was not open for renegotiation and they agreed that negotiations would only take place between the UK and the EU.But he said the Irish government would have an “obligation” to protect the single market in the event of a no-deal outcome.“If there is a no-deal Brexit at the end of October, Ireland will be under an obligation to protect the single market, it’s our single market, our economy and our jobs are dependent on it,” he said.“We will have to make sure that Ireland doesn’t become the back door to the European single market.”He added that the only way he could see of being sure of avoiding a hard border was through regulatory alignment.Asked about the Tory leadership race, Mr Varadkar highlighted that both of the candidates, who remain in the running to become prime minister, had voted for the Withdrawal Agreement.He said he looked forward to holding a meeting with the new prime minister and discussing potential changes to the Political Declaration.But he reiterated that there would be “no implementation period for the UKthere is no Withdrawal Agreement and there will be no Withdrawal Agreementthere’s no backstop”."},{"url":null,"title":"brexits impact on many crossborder initiatives

However, the -page mapping exercise gives an insight into the extent we could be impacted.The scope of areas highlighted is broad and includes everything from health, travel, waterways, animal movement and organised crime and drugs to benefit fraud, schooling, library provision and teacher and doctor qualications.For each of the  sectors, the document species the extent to which it is underpinned by the Good Friday Agreement as well as by existing EU legal and policy frameworks.In the case of the North West Cancer Centre, the report points out that the initiative was based on an intergovernmental agreement between Health Ministers from both jurisdictions.It says the centre at Altnagelvin Area Hospital, which opened in November , \"offers radiotherapy services closer to home for many patients from the north west, reducing their travel time signicantly\".Similarly, the All-Island Congenital Heart Disease Network is identied as ensuring that \"vulnerable children\" receive treatment on the island of Ireland. The network has a single surgical centre in Dublin and a specialist childrens cardiology centre in Belfast, supported by cardiology expertise in local hospitals. There is also cross-border cooperation on organ and tissues transplants. Nineteen areas are linked to the avoiding a hard border objective and include everything from customs and physical checks on live animals crossing the border to rules on movement of national treasures.Current EU rules \"stop national treasures from leaving the country and prevent illicit trafficking and looting\". Other less obvious areas mentioned in the report include the operation of cross-border taxis repatriation of waste and cross-border movement of waste, and even the management of Lough Erne eel stocks.It also species areas such as invasive alien species, chemicals regulation and wildfire initiatives.DUP MEP Diane Dodds said that in the majority of areas ongoing cross-border cooperation would be addressed by retaining the common travel area and pursuing an agreement on free trade and customs. \"In many cases, where frameworks are highly integrated, the circumstances are not unique to our province,\" she said.\"For instance the conditions required to operate both the Enterprise service between Dublin and Belfast and the Channel Tunnel will require a very similar technical agreement with Brussels.

It is for democratic politicians in the democratic world to do so,” he said.The chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Damian Collins said Sir Nick was wrong to say there was no evidence that Russia used Facebook to interfere in the referendum.“He is technically wrong on that point which he should know,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.“We asked Facebook whether there was any evidence of Russians buying ads during the referendum. There was – which they shared with us – on a very small scale, but nevertheless it was there.”He added: “There has been no proper audit done during the referendum.

Freedom of navigation is paramount. pic efuZqEOpK— Secretary PompeoJune , The US announced additional sanctions Monday on Iran aimed at pressuring the Iranian leadership into talks. The sanctions, re-imposed after Mr Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal, have crippled the Iranian economy and pushed up the cost of living. Iran has decried US sanctions, which essentially bar it from selling its oil internationally, as “economic terrorism”.Mr Pompeo, considered a hard-liner in Washington, referred to Iran as “the world’s largest state sponsor of terror” before he embarked on the hastily arranged Middle East stops on his way to India, Japan and South Korea.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo exits the plane at sunset as he arrives in Abu Dhabi He said he would be speaking with leaders in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates “about how to make sure that we are all strategically aligned, and how we can build out a global coalition … not only throughout the Gulf states, but in Asia and in Europe” that is prepared to push back against Iran.But Germany, France and Britain, as well as Russia and China, remain part of the nuclear accord that lted sanctions on Iran in exchange for set limits on its uranium enrichment levels. Mr Trump pulled the US out of the deal last year.Germany, Britain and France have sent envoys to Tehran recently, signalling they remain committed to diplomacy and dialogue. They cautioned against moves that can lead to conflict between the US and Iran.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Iranian merchants conduct their business at a carpet market of the old main bazaar in Tehran, Iran Berlin appears cool toward US talk of a global coalition against Iran as it tries to salvage the nuclear deal. German media have drawn parallels between Mr Pompeo’s talk of a coalition and President George W. Bush’s “coalition of the willing” against Iraq in , which Germany and France opposed.German foreign ministry spokesman Christofer Burger said his country had “taken note via the media” of Mr Pompeo’s comments and that Germany’s “top aim is and remains a de-escalation of the serious situation”.On Monday, Mr Trump tweeted that China and Japan depend on the security of the Persian Gulf waterways for the bulk of their oil imports, and he asked why the US is protecting the shipping lanes for other countries “for zero compensation”.“All of these countries should be protecting their own ships on what has always been a dangerous journey.” He said the US doesn’t “even need to be there” because it produces much of its own energy needs.Brian Hook, the US special envoy for Iran, said one option could be to “enhance” an existing multinational maritime force of about  countries that currently fights drug and arms smuggling in the region.Alternatively, he said allied nations with commercial interests in the oil-rich region could launch an all-new maritime security initiative.Another option could be military ships patrolling the Gulf waters and equipped with surveillance equipment to keep watch on Iran.The narrow Strait of Hormuz, which lies between Iran and Oman and opens to the Persian Gulf, is paramount for Asian oil importers. An estimated  million to  million barrels of oil, much of it crude, pass through the strait every day.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  This map provided by the US department of defence shows the site where they say a US Navy RQ- drone was shot down The US Navy, which has its th Fleet based in Bahrain to protect the strait, escorted oil tankers to ensure American energy supplies in the s when Iran and Iraq were targeting each other’s exports, but the US is no longer as reliant on Arabian producers.Today, any conflict that threatens tankers would badly disrupt crude supplies for energy-hungry countries like China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Indonesia, which are among the top five importers of Arabian oil.After his meetings in Saudi Arabia with King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Mr Pompeo tweeted that he had a “productive meeting” with the monarch and discussed “heightened tensions in the region and the need to promote maritime security” in the Strait of Hormuz.Mr Pompeo then travelled to neighbouring Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, another close US ally.The regional stops may be aimed at reassuring Washington’s Sunni Gulf Arab allies that the White House remains committed to keeping pressure on Shiite Iran following Mr Trump’s decision against retaliation, which likely raised questions about US willingness to use force against the Islamic Republic. \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo meets with Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman On a visit to Israel on Sunday, US National Security Adviser John Bolton, also considered a US hard-liner, said Iran should not “mistake US prudence and discretion for weakness”.Iran’s naval commander, Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi, declared that Tehran is capable of shooting down other American spy drones that violate its airspace, saying “the crushing response can always be repeated.” He spoke during a meeting of defence officials in Iran.Mr Trump has wavered between bellicose language and actions toward Iran and a more accommodating tone, including an offer for negotiations. Iran has said it is not interested in a dialogue with Mr Trump.One last visual: Red dot is the impact point of the trespassing drone against the border of Iran and the border of the United States. pic nqVYIEmkL— Javad ZarJune , Saudi Arabia and the US accused Iran of being behind attacks on tankers near the Persian Gulf in recent weeks, while the UAE has been urging diplomacy to avert a wider conflict.On the eve of Mr Pompeo’s visit to the kingdom, Yemen’s Iranian-allied rebels attacked a Saudi airport near the Saudi-Yemen border, killing a Syrian resident and wounding  other civilians, the Saudi military said.The Houthi rebels claimed they used bomb-laden drones to attack the Abha airport, the second in less than two weeks. Drones were also used against a Saudi oil pipeline last month.Saudi Arabia has been at war with the rebel Houthis in Yemen for more than four years.

ActBlue was instrumental in Democrats’  mid-term successes, drawing in more than . billion dollarsfrom a restive party base angered by Donald Trump’s presidency.Mr Trump promoted WinRed in a Monday morning tweet that included a link to donate to his campaign.“This new  will allow my campaign and other Republicans to compete with the Democrats money machine,” Trump said.I am pleased to announce the launch of https:t.co DMYaPCf. This new  will allow my campaign and other Republicans to compete with the Democrats money machine. This has been a priority of mine and I’m pleased to share that it is up and running! #KeepAmericaGreat— Donald J. TrumpJune , For years, Republicans were highly successful raising money through direct mail campaigns, a format the party dominated, but they have lagged in the online era.Despite fielding a number of for-profit s, the party has had far less success than ActBlue, a non-profit that saves donors’ information and allows them to give with a few taps of a smartphone.Developing a rival to ActBlue has been a priority for the Republicans ever since their midterm hammering.The major party committees are transferring their online fundraising activities to WinRed, with the Republican National Committee, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee all shting over. The hope is that will lead to a groundswell that brings others to the fold.In recent years, the party has relied most on big-dollar donors, who have written massive cheques. Mr Trump has been an exception and was propelled through the Republican primary and into the White House in  on a wave of small-dollar contributions.Republicans hope WinRed will be the dominant one-stop shop that pulls small-dollar donors in — and then persuades them to give to other candidates farther down the ballot.“WinRed is an important first step in levelling the playing field in the small-dollar donor race,” said senator Todd Young, chairman of the party’s Senate campaign committee. “A unied GOP fundraising  will allow us to harness the enthusiasm for President Trump’s agenda, build a long-term small-dollar network and win in .”That may be easier said than done.

Durkan said that many of the  staff at Foyle House, on the Duncreggan Road, will be made redundant as it will be \"impossible\" for them to relocate to Belfast.In  HMRC announced that the Derry tax office would close in  .It came as part of a move to reconfgure its offices into thirteen regional centres serving every nation and region in the UK, with one of these centres being located in Belfast.In July  HMRC declared that its Belfast Regional Centre would be based at Erskine House, Chichester Street, Belfast, and expected to open in late . It is on schedule to open later this year.This week, Sir Jonathan Thompson, Chief Executive and Permanent Secretary of HMRC, sent a letter to Mark H. Durkan asserting that based on current plans Foyle House will close in September , with staff moving, where possible, to the Belfast Regional Centre.There are currently around  staff in Foyle House and Mr Thompson accepted that the majority live outside reasonable daily travel to Belfast.Mark H Durkan had asked that consideration be given to the integration of HMRC workers in Derry into the Northern Ireland Civil Service.Speaking to the Derry News yesterday, he said: “The intention of HMRC to close their offices here in September  is something I have been appealing against since it was announced in November .“I had written to Head of Civil Service, David Sterling to consider the integration of Derry staff to available DAERA positions in Ballykelly. Why this obvious solution has not been given due consideration is beyond me.“And while HMRC have acknowledged a duty of care to ex-employees, the current plan to relocate  staff members to their Belfast offices is a highly impractical approachnot virtually impossible for those with families and caring responsibilities. For many the only option they have been left with is redundancy.“It is a ludicrous and tin-eared approach to remove employment opportunities, chronically lacking in the North West, and in effect to move more of our skilled workers to Belfast.“These experienced and highly competent staff would be an asset to any organisation. The inability to provide these people some peace of mind as well as affording them opportunities to apply their skills in similar roles closer to home, has been completely overlooked.”However, in his letter Mr Thompson said, “regrettably, there are no priority arrangements for redeployment of our staff into Northern Ireland Civil Servicedepartments.“The NICS is entirely separate from the Home Civil Service and, as such, HMRC staff can only apply for roles in the NICS which may be advertised externally, including those at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in nearby Ballykelly.”Mr Thompson added that it has always been made clear that HMRC wants as many people as possible to transfer to their new location and continue their careers in Belfast.“That is why we have committed to hold one-to-one meetings between staff and managers around a year in advance of any move, to discuss inidual circumstances.“The meetings will establish who can and cannot move and what level of support will be needed to keep people working for HMRC. The one-to-ones for this office will commence in September ,” he concluded.The letter went on to say that those who decide to travel to Belfast will be given financial support in terms of travel costs and in some cases with home moves.The option of working in other government departments would also be explored.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"creggan men mixing mayweather dream las vegas boxing encounter","story":"A boxing coach and personal trainer from Creggan has spoken about an ‘amazing’ trip to Las Vegas spent in the company of many of the fight game’s legendary characters never mind his best friend who just happens to be international footballer James McClean.James McClean recently decided to celebrate turning  by inviting a few of his close friends and their partners to go on a trip to Las Vegas.

She would gain on me during the swim and transitions, but I would pull away from her in the shoot and run and luckily managed to keep ahead of her on the last run which involved an incline to the finish, she said.ldquoBy my fourth time up it, this incline felt like Everest, but my training around Stormont Estate had me well conditioned for that. Suzie has an extremely busy summer ahead of her and is so looking forward to the challenges ahead.ldquoMy focus now is Traithle Europeans in June in Madeira, then Worlds in Florida in October.

They have also branded claims the mercury bath poses a health and safety risk as a ldquored herring and fear that replacing the existing mechanism could potentially damage the Fresnel lens.Described as a ldquoworkshop, the January meeting lasted over one hour with the official council record of the debate that ensued only amounting to a paltry two and a half lines.The Lecale Lightkeepers vehemently argued that they had a case for briefing councillors on the impact the loss of the beam would have but, surprisingly, the request was initially rejected.Instead, council officials insisted that officers from the the Commissioners of Irish Lights would be invited to future meetings of the districtrsquos respective DEA Forums to discuss the future of the lighthouse.The local authority said this was to ensure that information could be shared and that local stakeholders and communities were fully consulted on any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future, before any plans are finalised.Council officials also insisted that wide ranging public consultation on the future of the lighthouse would take place.Campaigners mdash who were at a complete loss to understand why they were initially refused an opportunity to meet directly with councillors over five months ago mdash have now been told they will get a chance to brief them and outline their case for the retention of the beam.The Lecale Lightkeepers have described the plan to remove the beam as ldquototally inadequate and unacceptable and are looking forward to outlining their case for its retention.They are also pleased that having heard from the Commissioners, politicians can now have face-to-face dialogue with campaigners.Campaigners have held several discussions with the Commissioners and frequently engage with the organisation as part of the bid to retain what they have described as a key facet of Lecalersquos heritage.ldquoWe welcome the opportunity to meet with councillors to demonstrate just how passionate people are about the retention of the beam, the spokeswoman declared. It is a symbol of unity in Lecale and has brought together all sides of our erse community. It must be retained.ldquoMeeting with councillors is particularly important for us. We have put together a detailed presentation on the lighthouse issue and will outline our concerns about the future of the beam which we cannot afford to lose for a whole host of reasons.The spokeswoman said that in the interests of fairness and given the sensitive nature of the beam issue, it was important that they meet with local politicians.ldquoCouncillors have had the opportunity to hear from the Commissioners and it is important that they hear what we have to say as the group representing those opposed to this controversial proposal, she continued.ldquoThe beam must be retained for future generations given that it is an intrinsic part of the maritime history and heritage of the area and is a stunning feature of the Lecale landscape.The spokeswoman added: ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council is backing the campaign to retain the sweeping beam and it is it important that councillors hear directly from campaigners. The beam must be retained we simply cannot afford to lose it from this area and see it consigned to the pages of history..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Curran steps down from government association position  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK councillor Dermot Curran is stepping down from his role as president of the Northern Ireland Local Government Association this Friday.The group is the representative body for the provincersquos  councils and Cllr Curran will leave his position at the grouprsquos annual conference which is taking place at Newcastlersquos Burrendale Hotel.The Ardglass man is Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving district councillor, having been elected to the former Down Council in , following the reorganisation of local government.He has served as NILGA president twice describing the accolade as both a ldquoprivilege and a challenge.While stepping down as the organisationrsquos president, Cllr Curran will remain a key member of the NILGA Executive.Cllr Curran mdash who was last month re-elected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash has been a councillor for  years and while already Northern Irelandrsquos longest serving politician, some of his council colleagues believe that he is the longest serving in the British Isles.Dedicated to public service, Cllr Curran said he has ldquothoroughly enjoyed his second term at NILGArsquos helm and looks forward to continuing his work with the organisation.He also believes that local councils will continue to play increasingly important roles in their respective areas and that an opportunity exists to unlock the potential of local government as the hub of public services.Cllr Curran said that over recent years councils had changed dramatically, as had the political, financial and legal environment in which councillors operate.He said while local authorities had more responsibilities and power than before, they were also increasingly stretched in terms of finances and resources, an issue which has been compounded since the suspension of the Assembly.ldquoThe  councils are a key element of investment and public service delivery, but they control just % of the public purse.

However, I doubt many think that it is the cradle of horse racing, but it is.We do of course have a famous racecourse, which has just hosted a festival of racing as part of the DownTime Summerfest.Some of you, dear readers, may even know that there is an earlier racecourse in Downpatrick mdash at Old Course Road. So racing has been going on for centuries in our beautul corner of the world. And we have also played a vital role in the foundation of the Sport of Kings.The breed of horse associated with modern horse racing is the thoroughbred. A mere glance is enough to tell even the casual observer that the thoroughbred does not look like other horses.When compared to a pony or carthorse, the thoroughbred is leaner, taller and sleeker. In fact, these horses are perfectly designed for racing. They have big lungs, a big heart and long, slender legs that can move swtly.They also need special care when compared with native breeds. They have thin hair coats and so need to wear rugs or live in stables in bad weather. They need special food to give them energy to race. So these features tell you that the ancestor of the modern thoroughbred came from somewhere hot mdash from the desert, in fact. The ancestor of our racehorses is from Arabia.Back in the th century, horses were bred for work and war, not pleasure. Officers prized horses that were fast to get them in and out of battle and keep them alive. By this time, the medieval charger of knights mdash the destrier mdash was out of fashion. They were too slow and cumbersome, and soldiers no longer wore heavy suits of armour.So the horse evolved through selective breeding to become fleet of foot. There were no horses faster than the Arabian, which was specially bred to become bigger and faster than its wild cousin. The armies of the Ottoman Sultan developed special studs to create this new war machine.In , one of these fine stallions, known as the Byerley Turk, found himself outside the gates of Vienna. The Ottoman Sultan wanted to capture the imperial capital of the Holy Roman Empire, an objective he failed to achieve when the Polish King John III Sobieski led the greatest cavalry charge in history to defeat the Ottoman forces.The Byerley Turk was captured and eventually brought to England, finding himself in the ownership of one Captain Byerley.His adventures were not over though. Recognising a fine animal, Captain Byerley adopted the Turk as his war horse. In  hewas called to Ireland to fight for King William and in  he fought at the Battle of the Boyne. Indeed, Captain Byerley later attributed his surviving that battle to the swtness of his favourite war horse.After the battle, the Turk was entered in a horse race mdash in Downpatrick. Of course, he went on to win that race and go on to be one of the most famous horses in history. The Flying Horse housing development to the east of Downpatrick is named after this famous race.The remarkable career of the Turk continued mdash and now we come to his ultimate destiny. He was put out to stud in Yorkshire. His pedigree was highly prize and he became the first of only three foundation sires of the modern thoroughbred breed.Genetic testing has revealed it is his DNA that is the most common in all modern racehorses. His progeny are successful right to this day including names such as Dr Devious, Ahonoora and Indian Ridge.And it all started with a fateful race in Downpatrick over  years ago. Needless to say,Downe Vets had been around then and caring for his veterinary needs, we feel he could have achieved more..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Hurlers seeking big upset at Croke Park  ","story":"DOWN senior hurlers go into Saturdayrsquos Christy Ring Cup final at Croke Park against Meath as rank outsiders.Few pundits outside the Down camp expect anything other than a comfortable win for Meath, but say that quietly in and around Ronan Sheehanrsquos new kids on the block.The Newry man, who has close connections to several Cork hurling legends, has engendered a new-found enthusiasm and confidence in his charges.His young hurlers are a real surprise packet this season and getting to the Christy Ring Cup final is a major achievement for his fledgeling side.Sheehan has invested heavily in youth and has two schoolboys in his starting .Downpatrickrsquos Tim Prenter, who plays his club hurling for Ballygalget and Ballycranrsquos Phelilm Savage are both in their final year at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and De La Salle, Downpatrick, respectively.Both lads were in the Down Schoolsrsquo side that lted the Mageean Cup earlier in the season and both hail from famous sporting families.Prenter, who also won a MacLarnon Cup medal with the Red High a few months back, is the son of former Antrim senior football defender Kieran Prenter and his grandfather Seamus Burns was a well known member of the all-conquering Belfast Celtics basketball team that swept all before them in the s and s.Savage, whose brother Liam is also in the team, is the son of former Ballycran and Ulster midfielder Gary lsquoGazarsquo Savage, who was also a noted centre half with Ballycam Celtic in the Newcastle League.There are also several other young players in the  with Portaferryrsquos Matthew Conlon, Ronan Blair, Darragh Mallon, Tom Murray, Caolan Taggart and Eoghan and Daithi Sands all in their early s.Throw in Liatroimrsquos Oisin McManus, P J Davidson and Ruairi McCrickard and Ballycranrsquos Stephen Keith, Gerard Hughes, Huw Flynn and Liam and Phelim Savage and you have the nucleus of squad that could dominate Ulster hurling for years.In addition to Prenter, Ballygalget provide the squad with, John McManus, Danny Toner, Marc Fisher and Cathal Coulter with Newry Shamrocks providing Paul Sheehan and Jordan Murphy.Helping Ronan Sheehan from the sidelines is Cork legend Diarmuid OrsquoSullivan and the Down manager believes his support has been critical in moving the side forward.ldquoDiarmuid has been doing a bit of defensive coaching for us and he has been there for all of the Christy Ring Cup games, he said.ldquoHe would know a lot of the boys from the development squads because he wouldrsquove come and done coaching sessions down through the years.

That is not the norm where in the public sector,\" he said.Dr Farry claimed it would have been \"fairly pointless, futile and counterproductive to proceed with the cap\" in August  and would only have led to a huge rush of claims.He said there was \"not a single thing\" he could have done or not done in terms of the PSNI case, and described talk of a cap at that time as \"a complete and utter red herring.\"He insisted that any attempt to introduce a cap at that time would not have got through the Executive, which he claimed was \"extremely dysal\" and \"a transactional clearing house\".Asked would it not have been common sense to discuss the matter with colleagues in the Executive, particularly the then finance minister, before making a decision on the matter, Dr Farry stressed that people in senior HR roles would have been well aware of the Bear Scotland judgement and its potential implications.Denying a suggestion that he was trying to push blame onto civil servants, Dr Farry said: \"This decision was mine. It was my political judgement that I made in the best interests of Northern Ireland and the public interest.\"Man trapped and seriously injured when wall in Luton building collapses Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"He added: \"In terms of my responsibilities, I am happy with the actions which I took. I acted with total integrity and in the public interest in the way I did it.\"On the issue of whether or not the PSNI should appeal the case to the UK Supreme Court, Dr Farry said he was sure the PSNI would be assessing last weeks judgement and will make a decision on it.Askedworkers should claim up to  years of back holiday pay they were legally entitled to, he said: \"I think employers should resolve the issue in terms of their workplaces and come to negotiated settlements with their staff around arrears. Where that doesnt happen I think employees would retain the right to exercise their right to a tribunal.\"Responding to the same question later in the programme, UUP leader Robin Swann said: \"If people are entitled to it legally at this minute in time.

As anticipation builds for next month’s Open at Royal Portrush, the veteran radio and TV presenter visited the host course as well as clubs like Royal Belfast, Royal County Down and the town of St Andrews in Scotland – recognised internationally as the home of golf. Gery Kelly and Bill MontgomeryGerry starts his journey at his home club in Ardglass tracing the beginnings of golf in Ireland and reveals a few surprises as he discovers the relatively unknown Ulster-Scots golfing pioneers who helped establish the sport here.He visits stately homes including Mount Stewart on the shores of Strangford Lough and Grey Abbey House – chatting with Lady Rose Lauritzen and William Montgomery – and travels to St Andrews to explore how the Scots claim to have invented the sport and what part they played in bringing the game across the Irish Sea. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p He also sets out to finally answer the age-old dispute about which club is actually the oldest in Ireland. Gerry, who has been playing golf for over five decades at Ardglass Golf Club, said: “Before I began filming for the programme, despite playing the game for most of my le, I actually knew very little about its history, and that’s a shame because there are few sports with as long and as rich a history. Gery Kelly at St Andrews“The thing that amazed me the most was the fact that golf was played in Scotland in the s and it took over  years before it came here. With all the movement of people between the two countries, that Ulster-Scots connection, why did it take so long for the game to be finally organised here ”Gerry, who has been playing golf since he was a teenager, said: “Golf is a sport you can get easily hooked on. It’s a game for le. I know people still playing in their nineties.“For me it’s not so much now about that standard of golf now.

In a statement, they said: \"With millions of people signing online petitions there is a clear appetite for using digital technology to engage with politics.\"By fusing online engagement opportunities with MPs of all parties the group intends to become a signicant mass movement with , members and  MPs onboard by the end of .\"More United CEO Bess Mayhew said: ldquoPeople see cross-party working as a proxy for trust in politics.\"Thatrsquos why we are delighted Stephen Doughty MP has chosen to be a part of the More United network.\"Now we need to start tackling the important issues being ignored because of Brexit and give a voice to people who want to move Britain forward. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Having stood empty for many years, I am delighted it is being given a new and exciting future. It is wonderful that the key features of the original beautully designed building are being preserved and transformed. It feels very appropriate, given my fatherrsquos very high standards and professionalism that The Moorwell is being designed and constructed with the same values. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

TrumpJune , For years, Republicans were highly successful raising money through direct mail campaigns, a format the party dominated, but they have lagged in the online era.Despite fielding a number of for-profit s, the party has had far less success than ActBlue, a non-profit that saves donorsrsquo information and allows them to give with a few taps of a smartphone.Developing a rival to ActBlue has been a priority for the Republicans ever since their midterm hammering.The major party committees are transferring their online fundraising activities to WinRed, with the Republican National Committee, the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee all shting over. The hope is that will lead to a groundswell that brings others to the fold.In recent years, the party has relied most on big-dollar donors, who have written massive cheques. Mr Trump has been an exception and was propelled through the Republican primary and into the White House in  on a wave of small-dollar contributions.Republicans hope WinRed will be the dominant one-stop shop that pulls small-dollar donors in mdash and then persuades them to give to other candidates farther down the ballot.ldquoWinRed is an important first step in levelling the playing field in the small-dollar donor race, said senator Todd Young, chairman of the partyrsquos Senate campaign committee. ldquoA unied GOP fundraising  will allow us to harness the enthusiasm for President Trumprsquos agenda, build a long-term small-dollar network and win in .That may be easier said than done.

The US has been building up its military presence in the Persian Gulf.Productive meeting with King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud today to discuss heightened tensions in the region and the need to promote maritime security in the Strait of Hormuz. Freedom of navigation is paramount. pic efuZqEOpKmdash Secretary PompeoJune , The US announced additional sanctions Monday on Iran aimed at pressuring the Iranian leadership into talks. The sanctions, re-imposed after Mr Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal, have crippled the Iranian economy and pushed up the cost of living. Iran has decried US sanctions, which essentially bar it from selling its oil internationally, as ldquoeconomic terrorism.Mr Pompeo, considered a hard-liner in Washington, referred to Iran as ldquothe worldrsquos largest state sponsor of terror before he embarked on the hastily arranged Middle East stops on his way to India, Japan and South Korea. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo exits the plane at sunset as he arrives in Abu Dhabi  --He said he would be speaking with leaders in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates ldquoabout how to make sure that we are all strategically aligned, and how we can build out a global coalition hellip not only throughout the Gulf states, but in Asia and in Europe that is prepared to push back against Iran.But Germany, France and Britain, as well as Russia and China, remain part of the nuclear accord that lted sanctions on Iran in exchange for set limits on its uranium enrichment levels. Mr Trump pulled the US out of the deal last year.Germany, Britain and France have sent envoys to Tehran recently, signalling they remain committed to diplomacy and dialogue. They cautioned against moves that can lead to conflict between the US and Iran. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Iranian merchants conduct their business at a carpet market of the old main bazaar in Tehran, Iran  --Berlin appears cool toward US talk of a global coalition against Iran as it tries to salvage the nuclear deal. German media have drawn parallels between Mr Pompeorsquos talk of a coalition and President George W. Bushrsquos ldquocoalition of the willing against Iraq in , which Germany and France opposed.German foreign ministry spokesman Christofer Burger said his country had ldquotaken note via the media of Mr Pompeorsquos comments and that Germanyrsquos ldquotop aim is and remains a de-escalation of the serious situation.On Monday, Mr Trump tweeted that China and Japan depend on the security of the Persian Gulf waterways for the bulk of their oil imports, and he asked why the US is protecting the shipping lanes for other countries ldquofor zero compensation.ldquoAll of these countries should be protecting their own ships on what has always been a dangerous journey. He said the US doesnrsquot ldquoeven need to be there because it produces much of its own energy needs.Brian Hook, the US special envoy for Iran, said one option could be to ldquoenhance an existing multinational maritime force of about  countries that currently fights drug and arms smuggling in the region.Alternatively, he said allied nations with commercial interests in the oil-rich region could launch an all-new maritime security initiative.Another option could be military ships patrolling the Gulf waters and equipped with surveillance equipment to keep watch on Iran.The narrow Strait of Hormuz, which lies between Iran and Oman and opens to the Persian Gulf, is paramount for Asian oil importers. An estimated  million to  million barrels of oil, much of it crude, pass through the strait every day. -- vw,vw,px, px\"This map provided by the US department of defence shows the site where they say a US Navy RQ- drone was shot down  --The US Navy, which has its th Fleet based in Bahrain to protect the strait, escorted oil tankers to ensure American energy supplies in the s when Iran and Iraq were targeting each otherrsquos exports, but the US is no longer as reliant on Arabian producers.Today, any conflict that threatens tankers would badly disrupt crude supplies for energy-hungry countries like China, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Indonesia, which are among the top five importers of Arabian oil.After his meetings in Saudi Arabia with King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Mr Pompeo tweeted that he had a ldquoproductive meeting with the monarch and discussed ldquoheightened tensions in the region and the need to promote maritime security in the Strait of Hormuz.Mr Pompeo then travelled to neighbouring Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, another close US ally.The regional stops may be aimed at reassuring Washingtonrsquos Sunni Gulf Arab allies that the White House remains committed to keeping pressure on Shiite Iran following Mr Trumprsquos decision against retaliation, which likely raised questions about US willingness to use force against the Islamic Republic.  -- vw,vw,px, px\"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo meets with Saudi Arabiarsquos Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman  --On a visit to Israel on Sunday, US National Security Adviser John Bolton, also considered a US hard-liner, said Iran should not ldquomistake US prudence and discretion for weakness.Iranrsquos naval commander, Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi, declared that Tehran is capable of shooting down other American spy drones that violate its airspace, saying ldquothe crushing response can always be repeated. He spoke during a meeting of defence officials in Iran.Mr Trump has wavered between bellicose language and actions toward Iran and a more accommodating tone, including an offer for negotiations. Iran has said it is not interested in a dialogue with Mr Trump.One last visual: Red dot is the impact point of the trespassing drone against the border of Iran and the border of the United States. pic nqVYIEmkLmdash Javad ZarJune , Saudi Arabia and the US accused Iran of being behind attacks on tankers near the Persian Gulf in recent weeks, while the UAE has been urging diplomacy to avert a wider conflict.On the eve of Mr Pompeorsquos visit to the kingdom, Yemenrsquos Iranian-allied rebels attacked a Saudi airport near the Saudi-Yemen border, killing a Syrian resident and wounding  other civilians, the Saudi military said.The Houthi rebels claimed they used bomb-laden drones to attack the Abha airport, the second in less than two weeks. Drones were also used against a Saudi oil pipeline last month.Saudi Arabia has been at war with the rebel Houthis in Yemen for more than four years.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you

Thats signicantly higher than % of bosses globally. And according to the firm’s latest Global CEO Outlook, Northern Ireland’s bosses are leading the way when it comes to embracing the ‘fast fail’ culture in an effort to make their companies as innovative as possible. Of the Northern Ireland bosses surveyed, % said they want their employees to feel ‘empowered to innovate. On the issue of Brexit, around two thirds of business leaders see the UK’s exit from the EU as the greatest threat to growth. Looking at overall growth, all of those questioned said they expect ‘top line revenue growth over the next three years’. But just % of company bosses said they ‘expect to increase headcount in the next three years of more than %’. John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential. This level of freedom will no doubt make sure that Northern Ireland companies are at the cutting edge of innovation in the years to come.” Angela McGowan, CBI director in Northern Ireland, said: “KPMG’s  Global CEO Outlook gives local business leaders some great insights into what is on the radar for chief executives across the globe and raises some important and interesting ideas around what leaders should doing to maintain competitive advantage despite the uncertainty.”  View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glandore_web.jpg","title":"glandore the family flexible workspace on the rise","story":"Posted on Wednesday June  by Ulster Business High-end flexible office company Glandore has expanded rapidly into an all-island family business with further growth on the horizon. Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tradeniiii.jpg","title":"new northern ireland trade alliance formed","story":"Posted on Wednesday  June  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s newest trade body alliance will take its message to Westminster later this year amid the ongoing political vacuum at home and with Brexit on the horizon. Trade NI is an alliance between Hospitality Ulster, headed by Colin Neill, Manufacturing NI, Stephen Kelly, and Retail NI, Glyn Roberts, and aims to represent a wider swathe of Northern Ireland’s private sector amid the “paralysis” surrounding a lack of Executive and therefore a lack of local political voice on the UK’s exit from the EU. The group will take its message to London on September , hosting an event to once again bring together politicians, businesses, stakeholders and the media to raise awareness of the issues and challenges facing companies here. The alliance, which has been supported by the likes of Heathrow Airport, Danske Bank and Flybe, outlined its aims at its launch in the Cathedral Quarter, Belfast, to an audience of business leaders from across Northern Ireland. “Northern Ireland is facing huge economic and political challenges ahead with Brexit, no Assembly, and a rapidly changing global economy,” the group said. “Trade NI will seek to give leadership on behalf of our three sectors and provide new policy solutions to creating a modern local economy.” “The paralysis that has been created with the lack of an Assembly and Executive has developed a situation where very little has been done to address the needs of our sectors or the economy at large. “The sht of power from Stormont to Westminster means that we must press decision makers there to implement policies and make legislative changes that will help grow Northern Ireland. Our local economy and businesses have taken a back seat and we simply cannot afford that situation any longer. “Our three organisations represent most of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland. Therefore, a louder voice needs to be heard on their behalf so that they don’t suffer in the wake of the local political issues. We want a reboot of the economic policy of Northern Ireland, in order to benefit our economy and safeguard our growing business community.” “Last year we held a NI business reception with over  people that brought together the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, MPs, lords, ministers and key political influencers in Westminster to bring focus to Northern Ireland issues.” “This was a great opportunity to be able to discuss the key concerns of the business community with national political decision makers and help them understand the priorities needed for Northern Ireland, and to promote Northern Ireland as a great place in the United Kingdom to locate or start a business.” Kevin Kingston, chief executive of Danske Bank, the main sponsor of Trade NI’s forthcoming Westminster reception, said that “Northern Ireland has a strong business community and should be considered across the United Kingdom as a thriving business hub for the global market”. “The vitality of the private sector is imperative to the strength of the Northern Ireland economy. We must ensure Northern Ireland businesses are well positioned to be able to compete in the post-Brexit environment. We will continue to work alongside the Trade NI alliance and other key influencers to make sure that Northern Ireland, as a constituent part of the United Kingdom, remains a key priority at Westminster.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.
