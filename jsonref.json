We had date nights once a month. We spoke openly about Tim’s affair and I thought we’d put it behind us.But within a year, he had started coming home late again. Last June, he said he needed to stay overnight on a plastering job nearby, and I asked if it was necessary.He told me not to be paranoid, but the distrust and distance grew. Last August, writing Tim’s anniversary card felt weird. Over dinner a couple of days later he said, seemingly out of nowhere, that if I fell out of love with him I should leave.Somewhere in my subconscious I admitted I was unhappy, but couldn’t bring myself to say so. It wasn’t until two days later that he finally admitted he didn’t love me any more. He agreed to move in with a friend.I couldn’t eat or sleep for days, telling our daughter Daddy had moved out because he didn’t love Mummy any more. I put off filing for orce, realising it would be expensive.But last December, I received a Facebook message from a stranger saying I should know that Tim had resumed his affair that summer. On confronting him he admitted it and said sorry.He said the affair was over this time, and I didn’t push for specifics. He has to live with the guilt, not me. I felt furious but conflicted. At first, I wanted to not only file for orce, but fight Tim in court for more than 50 per cent of the house — which I’ve been told, given the circumstances, I could be entitled to.But he was also the father of my daughter. Arguing about money would lead to bigger bills and, more importantly, more rows that would upset our little girl.I filed on the grounds of adultery because my solicitor said proving irreconcilable differences would be harder.Tim agreed — he didn’t have a choice. His solicitor’s fees have come to £900 so far. Perhaps unfairly, the person filing for orce has to foot the bigger bill.Days after initiating proceedings the country went into lockdown and Tim, no longer able to live with his friend, came to live with us — something I agreed to for our daughter’s sake.She knows her daddy doesn’t have anywhere else to stay. He’s at the other end of the house in the spare room, with his own bathroom. We take it in turns to cook meals.There are still heated moments, not least as our legal fees rise, but deciding to orce has taken away some of the tension.I think we’re both too shattered to be angry any more. Screaming and shouting would make me ill and upset our daughter. She knows that when our house goes on the market — next month, hopefully — she’s moving with me to her new home, although Tim and I have agreed to split custody.Some days I can forgive him for his affair. Other days I struggle. But I’ll always care for him as my daughter’s father, and as someone I’ve shared nearly 12 largely happy years with.I hope that our decree absolute, expected this autumn, brings us both a fresh start. And if nothing else, the heartache and expense of orce has made me sure of this much: I’ll never marry again.Tim gave Natasha his blessing to write about their marriage, but declined to comment.Interview by ANTONIA HOYLE"},{"url":null,"title":"Nicola Sturgeon says wanted cry pictures pubgoers no social distancing","story":"Share this articlePub at centre of coronavirus outbreak now has 27 confirmed cases - doubling in 24 hours - Mirror Online"},{"url":null,"title":"Workers resentful colleagues working home HR staff say","story":"Share this article Research by BrightHR, a company which provides HR support to small and medium businesses, found that there is an \u0027us and them\u0027 ision emerging in companies which have some staff members at home and some in the office. BrightHR CEO Alan Price said most small business were not yet ordering all their staff to return to the office due to social distancing rules and childcare concerns, although he said there could be a \u0027watershed\u0027 moment in September when children go back to school. New government guidance which came into effect on August 1 meant that employers can now ask staff to return to the office under the condition that social distancing rules must be maintained. Other HR experts said there was also growing tension between some employers and their staff over whether people had to go into work.   Natalie Ellis, from Your Virtual HR, told MailOnline: \u0027\u0027I\u0027m getting that a lot from clients. Employers like to see their teams and have an office environment, so we are seeing a conflict between them and their staff who want to remain at home.  \u0027Flexible working has been in the pipeline for many years, but what we\u0027re finding is that there are employees that don\u0027t want to return to work because they\u0027re getting used to a different way of life.\u0027  "},{"url":null,"title":"Ministers admit struggling Covid contact tracing improve","story":"Share this articleHe added: \u0027In reality, there will be a trade off with speed and effectiveness – even if a high proportion of people ill with COVID-19 are tested, it won\u0027t stop transmission if test results end up taking too long or infected contacts aren\u0027t traced before they become infectious.\u0027It comes as Mr Hancock said that testing in schools will be expanded due to machines which can reveal if a person is infected within 90 minutes.He said there is \u0027currently survey testing\u0027 in some schools but suggested the machines could be deployed to screen pupils even if they don\u0027t show symptoms.But the researchers warned that without improvements in testing, it will be \u0027absolutely essential\u0027 to introduce other measures to \u0027mitigate\u0027 the impact of schools opening.This could mean that pubs are forced to shut or greater restrictions are placed on meeting others indoors.The Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesman confirmed that all pupils will return full-time in September but acknowledged that outbreaks of coronavirus could force some schools to close.He said: \u0027You\u0027ve heard from the Prime Minister on many occasions his absolute commitment to getting children back into school in September and that\u0027s vital for their education and their development.\u0027We are planning for all pupils in all year groups to be in school full-time from the beginning of the autumn term.\u0027Evidence shows children are unlikely to get ill with the virus but it is still not clear how much they contribute to its spread.Yesterday new Australian research found there were \u0027low\u0027 levels of coronavirus transmission in schools and nurseries.

Tight restrictions on where we’ve been able to go and what we’ve been able to do have boosted the sales of fitness equipment as we’ve looked for ways to stay in shape, while staying safe.For many, this unprecedented situation has strained both our physical and mental wellbeing, but with lockdown measures easing and warmer weeks ahead, now is the time to renew good intentions and get more physically active.“Lockdown has knocked our health balance,” says Claire Davis, a fitness coach at wellness retreat 38 Degrees North. “We’ve eaten and drunk too much, exercised less than normal and succumbed to bad habits, increasing our stress levels. But summer is the ideal time to make healthy changes.”So whether your aim is to lose the odd lockdown pound, feel fitter or just stay strong enough to weather life’s next big storm, this is the perfect time to make the changes you’ve been daydreaming about.1. Borrow a dogSpoiler alert: walking is perhaps the best exercise there is as it’s low impact, can be done anywhere and almost anyone of any fitness level can get involved, for free.Just 15 minutes of moderate walking can see you cover about a mile’s worth of ground, so it’s easily one of the best ways to get out and get moving. Getting kids excited about going for a walk can be challenging, so why not lure them with the temptation of a furry friend for company? Borrow a neighbour’s dog to take to the local park or check out dog-lending websites such as borrowmydoggy to find a pooch in your area that may need its legs stretching.2. Pick local produceBecause of lockdown, the pick-your-own season has had a bit of a slow start, but many farms have now applied social distancing measures and reopened for business. A morning or afternoon picking your own fruit and veg is not only wholesome family fun (whisper it: exercise), but it also supports local businesses, and ticks the environmentally friendly box as it means fresh groceries without all of the unnecessary shrink-wrap. A quick Google should help locate your local farms (or try pickyourownfarms.org.uk) and remember to call to check opening times and crop availability ahead of your visit.3. Go for a dipSummer is the perfect time for outdoor swimming, whether that’s at your local lido (call and check that they’ve reopened) or somewhere a little more wild. There’s something extremely invigorating about braving the elements and swimming outdoors, and the UK is studded with rivers, lakes, ponds and beaches that are clean and safe to swim in.Wild swimming is loaded with health benefits, from lowering stress hormones to improving circulation and reducing inflammation, plus a 30-minute session in cold water can burn almost 400 calories. Visit wildswimming for locations close to you.4. Raise your voicePeople underestimate the fitness potential of a good old sing-song, but belting out a few tunes can burn calories, strengthen the diaphragm and pump more oxygen around the body than many other forms of aerobic exercise. It’s also brilliant for mental health – reducing stress, boosting self-confidence and releasing endorphins.Most local choirs remain on hold due to Covid-19 but many are holding virtual sing-alongs (check out singforfun).5. Hit the dance floorIt might be a while before nightclubs reopen, but dancing is a brilliant form of exercise and can be done right this second. Not only is dance a brilliant all-over aerobic workout, there is also a unique sense of freedom and empowerment that comes from moving your body to music, perfect for pepping yourself up post-lockdown.Dance instructor Illana Gambrill was so overwhelmed by people desperate to get back to Dancebox – her Essex-based classes – that she’s created a weekly online programme that is easy to sign up to, simple to follow and a bona fide saviour for mind, body and soul.6. Eat alfrescoWeather permitting, there is nothing more satisfying than sharing a meal with friends and family outdoors – the feelgood factor itself does much to boost our wellbeing. It is also thought to be of great benefit to children as outdoor eating – such as picnics and barbecues – often goes hand-in-hand with playdates and family bonding time. Fire up the coals or get a disposable barbecue to grill fish or lean cuts of meat such as chicken breasts or pork fillets, which are a healthier substitute for fatty burgers and sausages.Experiment with different marinades and simple side salads, invite some friends and don’t forget your brolly for the quintessential British experience. Fingers crossed you won’t need it.7. Learn to hulaHula hooping might conjure up visions of 1980s lycra-clad fitness types, or seem more like vintage child’s play, but it can actually burn as much fat as treadmill exercises, and other benefits include toning muscles and strengthening your heart.Advocates reckon that 10 minutes of hula-ing a day will see results and the plastic hoop should only set you back a couple of quid from a general store (although if you’re feeling fancy, a weighted one can be purchased for less than the cost of your average round at the pub). With minimal kit required and plenty of tutorials available online, this is an amazing way to start getting active again after the long lockdown break.8. Go geocachingImagine that you could be a part of the world’s biggest treasure hunt the moment you step out your door. Geocaching is exactly that. This free outdoor activity is suitable for all ages and uses the GPS on your smartphone to allow you to hide and seek secret containers at specific locations, marked by coordinates all over the world.Getting you out and about, turning you into real-life Lara Crofts – this is a brilliantly fun activity for the whole family. And with more than 3m caches to find, there’s bound to be something to sniff out near you. Register for a free basic membership at geocaching.9. Get out in the gardenThere is increasing evidence that gardening provides substantial health benefits – just interacting with flora lowers our cortisol, improving mood and mental health. You can also burn about 330 calories doing one hour of light gardening, plus when you’re outdoors your body makes vitamin D, which strengthens bones, although you should still apply sunscreen.If you don’t have a garden, search online for a local community gardening initiative failing that, plant some salad leaves in indoor pots. Growing your own food helps children develop a lasting habit of eating fresh vegetables and might make them more likely to try new (green) things.10. Walk and workFor many, lockdown has forced us to re-evaluate the way we work, revealing our astounding ability to multitask. So post lockdown, consider the ways in which you could make your regular working day that bit more active.Need to schedule a 30-minute meeting? Do what Steve Jobs was fond of and have a walking meeting instead. Or if somebody wants to meet up to talk business over coffee, suggest making it a takeaway and having a stroll. You can also extend these multitasking habits outside of work hours with a spot of “temptation bundling” – pairing something you love with an activity you’re trying to do more of. Make sitting in a squat while binge-watching box-sets the new normal.This advertiser content was paid for by the UK government.

But has reality finally overtaken his ketchup-smeared visions of corruption?Paul McCarthy’s vision of modern America is relentlessly revolting. His art depicts his nation as a crumbling edifice of pop culture, creeping fascism and depraved, uninhibited capitalism. “It’s always been this thing of looking at the underbelly of western culture, and the horror of its results,” he says over Zoom from his home in Los Angeles. “It’s a questioning of our condition, our way of life. Look at America right now with its racism and its violence, and yet we have Disneyland.” His art, he says, is “trying to expose that – the posing of the purity and the innocence”.Some of this work has been on a grand scale. In 2013, for the work Rebel Dabble Babble, McCarthy built two derelict houses in a dark, grim New York warehouse. Each one was filled with screens showing James Dean and the cast of Rebel Without a Cause engaged in brutal, close-up, hardcore pornography. A man in a long coat followed me around the show on my visit – the stereotypical flashing pervert, hands stuffed into his pockets, sweating and mumbling to himself. It wasn’t clear if he was part of the show or just a very excited gallerygoer, but it all contributed to the exhibition’s visceral unease. It was quintessential McCarthy.Now, the 74-year-old is returning to Switzerland – the country where 12 years ago he caused a sensation by exhibiting a giant inflatable turd that came untethered, brought down a power line and landed in the playground of a children’s home – for an exhibition of works from throughout his career titled Alpine Stories and Other Dystopias. He was born more than 5,000 miles away, in Salt Lake City, but Switzerland has been a lifelong obsession. “At quite an early age I was interested in mountaineering,” he says. “I think it had a lot to do with wanting to leave where I was. When I was in high school, I wanted to be a Swiss mountain guide, which was a pretty rare choice of occupation in Utah. It was about bohemian lifestyles, about somehow leaving these conventions of normality.”But McCarthy didn’t simply leave those conventions, he dedicated his life to exposing their decrepitude. If Switzerland represents a faraway ideal for American dreamers, McCarthy’s remake of the Alpine-themed Shirley Temple movie Heidi (created with with fellow artist Mike Kelley in 1992) set out to mock and denigrate Hollywood’s vision of a beautiful European escape. “The other subject that began to come up at that time for me was fascism. So this combination of the Alps, lederhosen, father figures, the Matterhorn, the Disneyland aesthetic, fascism and America all becomes a big stew.” A stew where the idealism of America and Hollywood is boiled until evil rises like scum to the surface.Due to problems with shipping art during the pandemic, the Swiss exhibition at Tarmak 22 in Gstaad features no new work, only pieces that were already in storage in Switzerland when coronavirus hit. “It’s a kind of smorgasbord,” McCarthy says. Now an art world that McCarthy says is usually “moving like a steam shovel” has been stilled, the pandemic has offered a rare chance to look back over older work. “Meanings change, you see things differently, you see connections, threads that weave through things.” The threads of violence and fascism, and the constant questioning of the state of things, appear again and again in his work, each new decade bringing fresh and relevant perspectives on old tropes.McCarthy left Utah in the early 70s to study fine art in California. Ever since, his complex and often utterly gross art has been headline-grabbing stuff. There was that rampant inflatable turd (Complex Shit, 2008) in Switzerland, his enormous buttplug balloon (Tree, 2014) in Paris, which was deflated by a protester he’s created animatronic rubber sculptures of George W Bush having sex with a pig, and drawings of Snow White and her seven dwarves defecating on each other.These days McCarthy is a well-respected art-world figure, with big museum shows and a major gallery representing him. But it took him a while to get there. He didn’t even sell any art until the early 90s. Before then, he’d been busy making a name for himself as the leading light of ultra-challenging American performance art, armed only with vomit, ketchup, masks and nudity – as in his 1976 film Rocky, which was on display in the early days of Tate Modern. It showed McCarthy dressed as the boxer, punching himself repeatedly in the head, pouring ketchup over his genitals, masturbating and muttering to himself. It’s relentless, violent, traumatic.When asked if America still needs exposing in 2020, a time when the country’s nastier sides are more apparent than ever, McCarthy’s tone switches from considered drawl to something closer to what you’d expect from a man who made a career out of rubbing ketchup into his orifices. “How much more absurd can you get than Donald Trump? It’s a really good example of a performance, it’s theatre. He’s really just manipulating a population. The idea that we could go, ‘Hey, we don’t need this any more, let’s just make images of utopia, of where we want to go …’” His voice trails off. He considers the idea silently for a minute, then his thoughts bubble over.“That’s your head in the sand. Maybe I don’t have a choice but to throw up. We’re still trying to figure out what the fuck’s going on. Even now. Like, what is going on? We’re so utterly fucked up that, if anything, we really do need these experiments into this reality.” He’s not sure if he’s going to make work about Trump yet, but you wouldn’t be surprised if he did.That’s the point of McCarthy’s art, be it film, sculpture, drawing, installation: to figure what is going on around you. There are no conclusions, no hard facts, just questions and experiments. But to do it the way McCarthy has always done it – with sex, violence, bodily fluids and sick humour – is a tricky thing in 2020. Does he ever worry about “cancel culture”, the threat of an online backlash? “When you refer to cancel culture, I don’t really know what that means any more,” he says with the weariness of a man who has spent his adult life being told he can’t make the art he’s trying to make. “But in the past few years I’ve been stopped a number of times, censored. I don’t know, four, five times a year.” He won’t be drawn on specific instances.That censorship may have increased as the world has grown more conservative, but it’s something he’s always taken in his stride. “I’ve always had this view that making risky art was just really risky. You don’t know what it’s saying, it sits on an edge. At times I’ve made work where I’ve gone, ‘What the hell, are you really sure that’s what you want to do?’” Few artists today do performances as in-your-face as his 70s works such as Class Fool, where he stuffed a Barbie doll up his backside and vomited over a ketchup-covered classroom. Few artists today are making installations as shocking or ambitious as Rebel Dabble Babble. It’s a testament to how hard he pushes things that, 40 years into his career, he’s still one of the most confrontational, shocking and jaw-droppingly weird artists you’ll encounter.The most striking thing of all is that his disgusting visions of modern life don’t seem all that far removed from reality. Whereas once you could look at what he did as extreme, now, the more you take in his violence and anger, the more you realise that the world has slowly transformed into a big Paul McCarthy artwork. It’s the greatest Hollywood twist of all: here you are, wading through the faeces thinking it’s just a nightmare, but actually you were awake the whole time. “We’re really in a much more confused state than we’ve ever been,” he says.It’s not McCarthy who’s weird and gross, it’s the world itself. Real life has just finally caught up with him – and that should seriously worry us all.• Paul McCarthy’s exhibition, Alpine Stories and Other Dystopias, is at Tarmak 22, Gstaad, until 15 August.

To mark her centenary, help choose one This month on the reading group, we’re going to read a book by PD James. This week marks 100 years since the birth of the writer known not only as “the new queen of crime”, and one of the last links to the genre’s golden age (she was dubbed the new queen after Agatha Christie’s death, a title James did not mind), but also “the doyenne of detective novelists”.James was one of the most successful crime novelists of the late 20th century, and into the start of the 21st. She won dozens of awards including the Crime Writers’ Association’s Diamond Dagger and the Mystery Writers of America Grandmaster award. Many of her works were adapted for television and cinema, and she sold truckloads of books. She was also widely regarded as “a very good writer” – which seems like reason enough to revisit her career now.That career began in 1962 when James was in her 40s and raising two children, working in a London hospital and looking after a husband who had returned from the second world war with mental-health problems. She woke up at five in the morning, and wrote before going to work, to produce her first novel, Cover Her Face, a kind of cosy crime caper featuring a refined poet policeman called Adam Dalgliesh.“I gave him the qualities I admire,” she said many years later, “because I hoped he might be an enduring character and that being so, I must actually like him.”Readers liked him, too. Dalgliesh appeared in 14 novels, and while his essential characteristics remained the same, the books grew deeper and darker. Violence and fear entered the cosy world she had first described. James’s writing could be nasty, and she had plenty of cold steel in her. “If I had a friend in distress I would have no hesitation in putting my arms around her to comfort her,” she once said, “but part of me would be observing the scene.”Alongside the Dalgliesh novels, she wrote two books about Cordelia Gray, a tough female detective. There was a Jane Austen pastiche called Death Comes to Pemberley and a dystopian satire about a world where the population is going down called The Children of Men – which is beginning to seem more and more prescient. In 1980, she also wrote Innocent Blood, a standalone novel about a murderous secret related to an adoption. This novel made her rich and finally allowed her to quit her day job as a civil servant in the Home Office, as Emma Brockes once explained here in the : “She sold paperback rights for £380,000 and film rights for £145,000 – more than she had earned in 10 years working at the Home Office – and promptly retired: ‘At the beginning of the week I was relatively poor and at the end of the week I wasn’t.’”Lucky PD James. Lucky us, too, because it enabled her to maintain a successful career until she published her final book in 2011.

Johan Lundgren, the chief executive, said the UK’s sudden decision to reimpose a quarantine for people arriving from Spain last month had not caused customers to cancel their travel plans but put them off making new bookings to the country. He said holidaymakers were now looking at other beach destinations such as Greece, Turkey and Croatia.He called for more engagement from the UK government, saying the aviation sector had not been consulted about the quarantine decision in advance, and proposed regional quarantines. “We urgently need to target quarantine requirements to where spikes have occurred rather than at national level,” he said.EasyJet, along with other airlines, was recently criticised by the Civil Aviation Authority for not issuing refunds for cancelled flights quickly enough. Lundgren said he could understand the frustration of customers and the airline was processing refunds within 28 days. “We are working day and night to get that down even further,” he added. He noted that easyJet was dealing with 260,000 cancellations in the quarter, which had led to a big backlog.Airlines started flying again in June after grounding their fleets for about 11 weeks, as governments imposed national lockdowns to stop the coronavirus spreading.EasyJet furloughed 4,000 of its 9,000 UK staff under the government’s job retention scheme but has kept its crews and aircraft in flight-ready mode so it can run more flights with about two weeks’ notice.The airline operated 709 flights in the three months to June, compared with 165,656 last year, and carried 117,000 passengers, compared with 26.4 million.It slumped to a £324.5m pretax loss in its third quarter, from a £174.2m profit a year earlier. It said its loss in the current quarter would be smaller but did not make a prediction for the whole year.The collapse in air travel has forced many airlines to announce big job losses. EasyJet plans to cut up to 727 pilot jobs – roughly one in three – and up to 1,200 cabin crew jobs across the UK. Overall, it plans 4,500 redundancies across Europe. The carrier also raised £450m from investors to shore up its cash reserves.EasyJet called on the UK government to temporarily remove air passenger duty to aid the recovery of the airline industry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48983d6738fc9ae641debbd9cf41037a21dc73a3/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82f9015d81c8eacd663429879c2e3296","title":"bp halves dividend covid 19 stock market ftse oil business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial newsMore bad news. Retail Week are reporting that 800 jobs are being cut at electricals retailer Dixons Carphone, via a store management shake-up.Pizza Express is the third company to announce major UK job cuts this week, and it’s only Tuesday morning.Yesterday, fitness and gymwear firm DW Sports collapsed -- putting 1,700 jobs at risk -- after being forced to shut its shops and gyms during the pandemic.The pandemic also forced family-owned tour operator Hays Travel to cut 900 jobs. Hays blamed the government’s crackdown on travel to Spain, which it said had spooked customers from going on package holidays.Efforts to expand Pizza Express into the Chinese restaurant market also pushed its debts up.The iconic PizzaExpress chain, born in London’s West End in the 1960s and ubiquitous in town centers across the U.K., has been hit by changing consumer habits in its home market at the same time as having to shoulder the financial burden of Hony’s plans to expand the brand overseas.The company was already struggling under its debt pile before the coronavirus pandemic forced it to close restaurants in March.They also flag up that the creditors who will take control of the company from Hony include Cyrus Capital Partners LP, HIG Bayside Capital and Bain Capital Credit, who all own its senior-secured bonds.Hot out of the oven, here’s our news story on Pizza Express’s job cut plans:If most of PizzaExpress’s restaurants were profitable before the pandemic, how did it run up such huge debts?Well, it wasn’t the cost of assembling those doughballs, sloppy giuseppes and polenta chips. The pizza business hasn’t folded, although there is more competition from rivals such as Franco Manca.The problem is that PizzaExpress has been owned by two private equity firms in recent years -- first the UK’s Cinven, then current owners Hony Capital of China. Private equity firms like to load their firms with debt (rather like a star chef piling on the toppings), as it cuts the tax bill, and you can pay off the interest with cashflow.But that strategy can backfire if sales slow (and is obviously disastrous if they stop altogether).As the BBC’s Simon Jack explained last year:The Chinese company bought it from UK private equity firm Cinven in 2014. Few companies emerge from private equity deals without being laden with borrowing.Interestingly, Pizza Express uses exactly the same font and layout for its financial statements as it does for its menus. Unlike the menu, however, there are some quite unappetising items in its financials.Most off-putting of all, of course, is the enormous debt number. The interest on that £1.1bn is costing the company £93m a year, which wiped out all its operating profit last year - and then some.In fact, the debt payments have pushed Pizza Express into the red for the last two years with a loss of £55m last year alone.PizzaExpress hasn’t revealed which restaurants will close under its restructuring.Exact details of the future restaurant estate have not yet been agreed and will be announced when the CVA is formally launched.If PizzaExpress’s creditors support the insolvency plan, it hopes to find redeployment opportunities for some of the 1,100 employees affected by the restaurant closures.Zoe Bowley, PizzaExpress’s UK \u0026amp Ireland managing director, is optimistic that 9,000 jobs can be saved across the company through the restructuring plan just announced. “Our business has a long history of success, but the UK-wide lockdown has hit the hospitality industry particularly hard. While the financial restructuring is a positive step forward, at the same time we have had to make some really tough decisions. As a result, it is with a heavy heart that we expect to permanently close a proportion of our restaurants, losing valued team members in the process. This is incredibly sad for our PizzaExpress family and we will do everything we can to support our teams at this time. As we continue to reopen our restaurants for dine in and delivery, we will successfully navigate the extended period of social distancing expected in the months ahead and, in so doing, protect 9,000 jobs. The initial signs from the restaurants that have been reopened have been very encouraging and we hope that our loyal customers continue to support us now more than ever.” Newsflash: Up to 1,100 jobs are being cut at restaurant group PizzaExpress.Under the plan, PizzaExpress’s creditors are agreeing to cut its external debts from £735m to £319m and provide £144m of fresh capital.That money will help the firm reopen many of its UK stores, the “vast majority of which” were trading profitably before lockdown. But a swathe of sites will shut in the UK, through a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) with lenders. That insolvency process will allow it to negotiate rent cuts, and quit under-performing sites.PizzaExpress says it has analysed which of its restaurants are still profitable, given the pandemic has changed working patterns and demand to eat out.This decision is a very difficult one however, against the current unprecedented backdrop, PizzaExpress believes reducing the size of its estate will help it to protect 9,000 jobs.Speaking of Spain... the latest jobs data shows that unemployment fell sharply last month, but remains alarmingly high.The jobless total fell by 89,849 people in July, which the Spanish Labour ministry says is the biggest drop for any July since 1997.Encouraging news, except it still leaves 3,773,034 people registered as unemployed.EasyJet is calling for a more nuanced approach to Covid-19 quarantines, rather than the blanket rules covering Spain.Reuters has the details:The CEO of British low cost airline EasyJet said UK government quarantine rules on Spain had not caused customers to cancel travel plans but it was deterring new bookings, as he called for a more targeted approach.“We urgently need to target quarantine requirements to where spikes have occurred rather than at national level,” chief executive Johan Lundgren told reporters on Tuesday.Here’s our full story on its plans:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b10a8fb368ed24b7718f56aef78a2345fbfdde7/0_0_2530_1518/master/2530.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2399a6e83db96af8b92b248fa29c37aa","title":"people need support to follow local lockdowns not orders from above","story":"If communities feel singled out, discriminated against, left behind and ignored, blame the messenger not themAt the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in the UK, we heard much talk of “behavioural fatigue”, the idea that people lack the willpower to endure tough restrictions. Though it wasn’t clear where the idea had come from, it was invoked many times as a justification for delaying lockdown – and so contributed to the loss of many thousands of lives.As psychologists who study disasters and emergencies predicted , the public showed remarkable resilience through the lockdown. Compliance was high from the start, and remained so throughout. People stayed home to protect their communities even though many suffered personally from doing so. And when Dominic Cummings broke the lockdown rules, displaying the weaknesses that the government had earlier projected onto the population, people continued to comply with them despite – not because of – Westminster.Perhaps the clearest psychological lesson to come out of the pandemic so far is that it’s wrong to think people are mentally fragile. When a common challenge leads us to come together and support each other, we can show remarkable psychological resilience. Put simply: people will accept some suffering for a bigger cause.So why are we seeing a variant of the “behavioural fatigue” argument all over again? The premature easing of restrictions, lack of clear regulation and inadequate test and trace system in England have led to a surge in infections. As controls are hurriedly reimposed in various parts of the country, we’re increasingly hearing politicians and pundits ponder whether people will be able to stick to a second lockdown. If they don’t, the underlying implication is that the fault lies in their psychological weakness.Like the proverbial goldfish swimming around its bowl, we seem to have forgotten everything we witnessed first time round. We’ve forgotten the sacrifices people made for their communities, and that where compliance dipped, it was generally due to poor or confused messaging about what people should be doing, and a lack of support to make compliance possible.Across the world, the poor were more likely to break lockdown than the rich – not because of any difference in motivation, but because staying home is a luxury not everyone can afford (and not everyone has a home). In short, the failures were those of politicians, not the public.These failures are much more apparent second time around.There are two elements to this muddle. People need a general understanding of the situation in order to see why new regulations are necessary. They may be prepared to suffer for a cause, but they won’t comply if there’s no clear cause to suffer for. They also need a clear and detailed explanation of what they are supposed to do. When the government switched from “stay at home” (which is behaviourally specific) to “stay alert” (which can mean anything, and hence means nothing), the rot set in.Next, let’s consider the issue of support. During the first lockdown, in large part due to public pressure, schemes were put in place to assist people staying at home. Support for people shielding was far from perfect, but at least it was something. Since then, the issue of support seems to have mysteriously disappeared. There are no statistics available on how many people are asked to self-isolate after they test positive for coronavirus, and none available on whether they actually do so. There is certainly no attention given to how we can provide people with the resources and the help they need to make isolation a viable option.This is equally true when it comes to the question of local lockdowns. We should avoid using the term “lockdown” – lockdowns are what you do in prisons, and suggest people have done something wrong and need to be punished (indeed Matt Hancock’s explanation that a lockdown in Oldham resulted from people “not abiding to social distancing” makes that accusation explicit.Lockdowns make you think only of restrictions. But areas of high infection are generally areas of high deprivation. Those affected are often marginalised and vulnerable people in need of support – such as more and clearer information, accessible testing facilities, assistance for those needing to isolate and help for local businesses required to close. Language is always revealing, and never more so than in this case: we need local support packages, not local lockdowns.If we support rather than blame those in areas of spiking infection, they won’t feel singled out, discriminated against, left behind and ignored (as is happening in places such as Oldham and Leicester ) – all of which further undermines compliance. They will feel a valued part of a national effort against coronavirus.Will people abide by new lockdown restrictions? They certainly have the psychological capacity to do so. Whether they actually do will depend on whether the measures are equitable, whether they include the necessary forms of support, and whether it’s made clear why they’re necessary. The people will do their bit if the government does its too.• Stephen Reicher is a member of the Sage subcommittee advising on behavioural science, an adviser to the UK and Scottish governments on coronavirus and professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db1ada54c2ec0dc4a3075dc2c6b4119870290077/0_100_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d28cc1923933a4d02f3c9b4ac6fefc1","title":"rightwing academic freedom policy exchange thinktank","story":"Are rightwing academics being silenced? The Policy Exchange thinktank says they are – and it has plans for cracking down Another day, another skirmish in Britain’s culture war. Once again, universities have found themselves on the frontline. According to a report from the thinktank Policy Exchange, Academic Freedom in the UK, pro-Brexit and rightwing academics are being “forced to hide their views”.This group of 10 or so academics presumably includes the “Tory leaver” respondent who claimed to have been threatened by their university’s marketing department for not “explicitly condemning conservatism as immoral” in a journal article. The poor soul was also told that “remaining impartial” would entail disciplinary action. To be fair, it’s not just leavers who are persecuted one “centrist remainer” was apparently removed from a programme after they failed to show sufficient deference towards a photograph of Jeremy Corbyn on a manager’s desk. That the authors were apparently gullible or lazy enough to print these responses, which seem to me like deliberate piss-takes, tells us all we need to know about the report’s credibility.But while both the report and its recommendations are laughable, that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t take them seriously. One of the authors, Eric Kaufmann, the head of the politics department at Birkbeck, University of London, recently called on students and others to report academics for engaging in “politically motivated” attempts to “alter the curriculum”. Who will judge whether such alterations are acceptable? None other than Policy Exchange, under the auspices of its new History Matters project.It all sounds a bit McCarthyite, doesn’t it? In principle, just about any new addition or minor change to the curriculum could be deemed “politically motivated” – from replacing Shakespeare on the curriculum with Stormzy, to my own attempts, when devising a course on the economics and politics of UK immigration, to inject more sources into the curriculum and develop perspectives from different countries.Perhaps the thought police really are stalking the corridors of the ivory tower – but they aren’t the same people that the Policy Exchange report identifies. It turns out that academic freedom is only good when your views are defined as acceptable by a rightwing thinktank with close links to Downing Street.Conflicts between politicians (especially, but by no means always, on the right) and academia are nothing new. And given who provides the funding, government and society have a legitimate interest in what academics do, and how we do it. What’s different here, however, is a concerted push by some academics and thinktanks to misrepresent how universities actually work, in order to impose from the outside their own conception of “ersity”, and their own definition, enforced by government diktat, of what is and what is not acceptable. Now that is genuinely “chilling”.Leaving this hypocrisy aside, we can all agree that we don’t want legitimate research stifled. But what are we actually talking about here when we speak of “stifling research”? Helpfully, Policy Exchange are not afraid to elaborate. Suppose a colleague of mine at King’s announced that her new research project would investigate the hypothesis that Jews are genetically predisposed to care more about money than non-Jews. How should I respond?To insulate this researcher from people like me, who might irrationally conclude that the university would be better off without her research, the report suggests creating a new position, a “director for academic freedom” at the Office for Students. They would be empowered to investigate alleged infringements of academic freedom – yet such breaches wouldn’t be confined to somebody suggesting that a certain research topic is not appropriate for a modern university. Suppose you’re just not very good at your job, in the eyes of your colleagues and peers. Could you be dismissed (or even denied promotion) for “low-grade scholarship”? No, according to Policy Exchange. Such a move would be the thin end of the wedge, as “other academics may be willing to let such a judgment be swayed by political disagreement”.• Jonathan Portes is professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London and a former senior civil servant"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f57b6fc31ed6a7fb7fffff46f7a7ce856e75c8da/0_191_5760_3458/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c90162f38d33cf4f45e4920210e158c","title":"the teacher who decided to unschool her own children","story":"Anna Dusseau felt her son and daughter were being ‘processed’ in school. Now she has advice for those thinking of home educating in September Teacher and home educator Anna Dusseau was happy to give advice to parents on home schooling in a radio interview during the Covid-19 lockdown – until the presenter cut her off mid-stream. He said he didn’t think listeners would be interested in what she had to say and severed the phone link.Undaunted, Dusseau, an English teacher, is about to publish a book of advice outlining her approach to home schooling her own children, which includes 100 learning activities parents can try.With some families afraid to send their children back to school in September and the teacher unions warning that it may not even be safe to reopen some schools, parents are likely to need all the help they can get to keep their children motivated.So what went wrong with the interview? With the school closures, the presenter wanted tips on how parents could keep an unwilling child’s nose to the grindstone. Dusseau, however, doesn’t believe in forcing children to learn and urges parents to adopt an “unschooling” approach, at least until the children recover from what she sees as the coercion of the curriculum in schools in England.“Many children’s lives are so busy with school journeys, subject changes, after-school clubs and homework that they have little time to think, or to take ownership of the life they are leading,” she says. “They spend an awful lot of time being ‘processed’ by well-intentioned adults.” “What home schoolers want for their children is space to grow, space to develop themselves, discover the world, find out what they are interested in, who they really are and what they want to do in life and then the academic qualifications that will get them there,” she says. “There are lots of parents who already home educate and you don’t have to be supermum or dad to do it,” she says.That said, she accepts that some families prefer a school-at-home approach and can do it with great success. “For this, you will be following a curriculum and meeting targets throughout the academic year, perhaps with a timetable or daily window in which study happens and using resources such as workbooks, textbooks or online learning,” she says.In fact, teachers taking their children out of school is becoming a trend, she claims. “Plenty of teachers leave the profession each year, and plenty – like me – decide to home school their own children. They know what goes on in schools. This is a significant trend that the government appears to deliberately ignore, perhaps because it says so much,” she says.Dusseau has three children aged one, four and six with her French husband, a computer network engineer. They both worked in London – she at a large, west London academy – until two years ago, when they left city life for a converted barn in rural Bedfordshire.In her book, The Case for Home Schooling, Dusseau advocates what became known in the 70s and 80s as “discovery learning”, the idea that children learn best by asking questions and following their instincts, be it staring into rock pools or looking up at the sky. The pandemic has been an unsettling time and children need space, she says. She doesn’t teach the times tables, believing her children will learn maths through everyday activities such as cooking and through talking with them about numbers. Instead of five-year-olds studying the Great Fire of London, they should be reading comics, she believes.Sadly, home education has been given a bad name by the formal worksheets and exercises sent home by many schools in the lockdown, she believes, but at least parents now know the kind of pressures their children face every day. In fact she goes further, blaming today’s test- and results-driven English school system for contributing to the ills of society.Dusseau became a home schooler “by accident” after she witnessed what she thought was bullying in the playground but what the teacher saw as normal bickering. And after another incident involving her daughter and an older girl, she says the decision was made. It was not the only problem she had with the school. She disliked the lists of 10 of the 100 most used words in the English language that five-year-olds brought home to learn for weekly tests and she was worried that her daughter seemed to dislike reading.To be fair, her own experience of school as a child has also influenced her. She was a school refusenik and missed a lot of time at primary school, which was allowed in that more relaxed era because she was making good progress. It was when she got to middle school that she began to rebel because she disliked being corralled into learning what the school wanted her to know.After taking their daughter out of school, at first the Dusseaus were looking for somewhere with a different approach, such as a Steiner school. Then, after a few months, they realised their daughter had changed from hating reading aloud to “fluently reading any book from the shelf to her brothers at bedtime”. Last night it was Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, she says.“Our son was similarly influenced by the change in dynamic. He began taking anything he could open with a screwdriver up to the kitchen table, to disassemble it. I was quite astonished. And this was when we first thought seriously about home schooling as a long-term prospect,” she explains.Given her dislike of school, why did she go into teaching? It’s an obvious question and she’s ready for it. “It is astonishing – incredible, really – the number of teachers I’ve met who despised school themselves, just as I did. And yet we come back to it apparently choosing to spend the rest of our working lives governed by changeover bells and despotic leadership, like some form of school-based Stockholm syndrome. We inflict on our students, year on year, what was done to us,” she says.She did well at school in spite of it. “I got one of the best sets of GCSE results in the country because I was good at passing tests,” she says. Her teachers wanted her to apply to Oxford or Cambridge but she chose Birmingham because she thought it would be more fun, dropped out of an English degree and then went back to complete her degree near home at the University of Exeter. She did her PGCE at the Institute of Education in London.“I’ve met quite a few teachers with a similar profile to me, who describe themselves as reluctant students turned teachers,” she says. “I think you have to debunk the idealised view of the profession. This mythology of people having a calling to be a teacher is not real. It is just a job and many people in teaching are quite ordinary people. Not everyone is an exceptional academic who can spout forth about their subject. It is not actually like that in the classroom, it is quite pedestrian,” she says.“I will happily home educate my children all the way through their education, if that is what they want to do. They always have free choice and we take their thoughts and feelings into account with every decision regarding their future.” She knows she is lucky to have the money to home educate but claims it is not just a middle-class luxury. “I’m middle-income, middle-class and I’m not going to pretend to be anything else, but you will find a wide variety of people home educating their children. Increasingly children are being off-rolled from school so their parents have to do it,” she says. “We need more choice for parents, school isn’t for everybody.”The Case for Home Schooling will be published this month by Hawthorn Press."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b2d09a44ebcaec2c6b6287bb1c56a03a1b152a6/0_250_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3d0edae63689c4f8b02b49f6b0acdec","title":"what is clearing plus the new tool for uni applicants","story":"Ucas hopes its new scheme will save time and help socially disadvantaged students, but there have been criticisms tooThis year’s cohort will have a new tool to add to their armoury: clearing plus. The new online service from Ucas aims to assist students in finding university places by using algorithms to match them with available courses to suit their grades. From July, unplaced applicants are able to sign in to their Ucas account to see a personalised list of suggested courses from a database of around 25,000. In theory, it should make the concept of clearing a lot less daunting than it was in the days of phoning a busy helpline.So how does it work? In short, the programme creates a match score between 0-1 based on how relevant a particular course is to a student, taking into account grades and subject profile as well as their subject choices. This score determines the order in which available courses are displayed, so that the best matched courses are at the top of the list. Courses are also grouped into “clusters” based on the proportion of applicants at each grade level and their other university applications.As well as saving time and stress for students, its designers hope it will also help to widen access to higher education for underrepresented and socially disadvantaged groups. While universities can’t filter specifically for ethnicity or gender, they can target their courses towards underprivileged students based on measures which categorise iniduals’ socio-economic backgrounds in accordance with their postcode. This means a university could choose to only make a course visible to students from the poorest socio-economic backgrounds with particular grades.Rachel Hewitt, director of policy and advocacy at the Higher Education Policy Institute, says the metrics “are not without flaws”. Experts have criticised postcode-based measures of disadvantage like POLAR in the past for drawing on outdated information and ignoring other important characteristics that might make a student more vulnerable.That students using clearing plus might be encouraged to consider courses that candidates similar to them have chosen also rings alarm bells for Gill Wyness, assistant professor of economics at University College London. A study she co-authored on course matching found that women enrolled in courses that were just as academically prestigious as men, but lower-earning. “That was driven by subject choice – so if the algorithm points women to similar subjects as they put down on their original form, it may well exacerbate the problem.”Another criticism is that clearing plus does not extend far enough. The service can be used by pupils who have confirmed places, but only on the condition that they give up their offers and “self-release” into clearing. “We know from existing research that socially disadvantaged students are more risk-averse, so they may be less likely to risk trading in their offers,” says Wyness. “Waiting until students are in clearing seems to be too late, when the majority of students have already taken up their places.’While it’s too early to gauge what students themselves will make of the tool, the consensus from those familiar with clearing seems to be that the scheme is a welcome addition.Iman Hussain, a 21-year-old computer sciences student, secured his place at the University of Wolverhampton through clearing in 2017 when he fell short of his expected grades. “Having the right data to create a shortlist of five to 10 universities could be a very useful tool, especially when students are faced with so much choice,” he says.At the same time, he is wary of over-reliance on algorithms. “If the matches are being made for you based on data that might not be absolute, then it could really mess around with your future plans.“For me, one of the best things about clearing was that it gave me the chance to speak directly to someone from the university and I don’t think clearing plus should ever replace that,” he adds. “I spoke to a previous student who put me through to an actual professor, and that made me feel really valued and that I had a route to take, regardless of grades.”Amy Smith, associate director of admissions at Nottingham Trent University, agrees that clearing plus has its limitations. “Not all students will have access to clearing plus and it will not show all available opportunities, so I would still encourage students to look on Ucas and contact universities to understand the full range of vacancies available,” she says. “Students will still need to be proactive and ready to talk to universities about submitting a clearing application to them.”While universities like hers will encourage students to make use of the matching tool, she says students shouldn’t be afraid to call universities themselves. “We would also advise applicants to speak to current students or graduates about their experience.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd8e00cddb20dd49658051a329b3a8b231575028/0_6_6016_3608/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d132417f3be6546f2167992f1c59057","title":"wildlife forensics how a giant pangolin named ghost could help save the species aoe","story":"A new research programme in Gabon is identifying the ‘isotopic fingerprint’ of the world’s most-trafficked mammal in the fight to beat smugglersAfter a two-week chase through Lopé-Okanda national park, a mosaic of rainforest and savannah in central Gabon, David Lehmann and his Wildlife Capture Unit were celebrating – they had caught a giant pangolin nicknamed Ghost, the biggest on record.The team – consisting of eco-guards, an indigenous tracker, a field biologist and a wildlife vet – hope that Ghost, who weighs 38kg and measures 1.72m from nose to tail, will give valuable insights in their fight against poaching. A nocturnal lifestyle and the fact that it feels most at home in a complex system of deep inaccessible burrows makes the giant ground pangolin – Smutsia gigantea – one of the least researched species in the animal kingdom.“We know little about their basic ecology, their movements and population sizes, and our lack of knowledge hinders our efforts to protect them,” says Lehmann, a wildlife ecologist. His research is part of the EU’s Ecofac6 programme, a commitment that started in the 1990s to safeguard bioersity in the Congo basin. “What we are doing here is pioneering work,” he says.The only scaly mammal in the world, a pangolin’s body is covered with razor-sharp, overlapping keratin plates. When attacked, it rolls into an armoured ball with scales raised: an effective defence against predators, but not against the snare traps of poachers. Pangolins are thought to be the world’s most trafficked mammals. With the four Asian species already hunted to near extinction, the African Wildlife Foundation estimates that around 2.7 million pangolins are trafficked from Africa’s rainforests each year.Popular for its meat, the pangolin has long been hunted for local consumption but Gabon’s minister for forests, oceans, environment and climates, Professor Lee White, argues that it is the demand in Asia that is of chief concern.Pangolin scales are a popular ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine, used for anything from rheumatism, asthma and cancer to treating infertility in women and promoting lactation. There is no scientific evidence for the effectiveness of the medicine, so wildlife groups welcomed an announcement in June that pangolin was being removed from the official 2020 listing of ingredients approved for use in traditional Chinese medicine. But any benefits from the move have yet to filter down.“Gabon is seeing the commercial poaching of pangolins,” says White. “The demand from China and the enormous profit margins are attracting organised crime.” International syndicates smuggling ivory, minerals, gold and diamonds at the border with Cameroon have expanded the scope of their business, he says. “For three years now we have been detecting ivory poachers with sacks of pangolin scale.”Lehmann wants to “provide governments with rapid and accurate tools for habitat conservation, and improve wildlife crime forensics in general”, and hopes his research will bolster efforts against poaching and trafficking.Knowledge about the size of the pangolins’ hunting grounds, their population density and seasonally preferred habitats could help the Gabonese National Park Agency to step up effective protective measures, such as more targeted patrols.Lehmann and his team take live samples from giant pangolins such as Ghost – something, according to Lehmann, that has never been done before. After capture and sedation, samples of blood, saliva, faeces, tissue and scales are taken from each animal and then a GPS transmitter is fastened to its tail. The entire procedure lasts about two hours and provides a unique set of data.In addition, a network of 24 to 40 camera traps has been set up in Lopé-Okanda national park to monitor the animals’ movements, nest ecology and habitat use. It is hoped that information from the camera traps combined with spatial data will provide an insight into the animal’s life expectancy, territoriality and motion range, and shed light on its reproductive behaviour. “We are opening the door to a new universe,” says Lehmann.The scale samples are used to extract their isotopic values, the unique composition of chemical elements such as oxygen, hydrogen or carbon that are stored in the animal’s keratin plates. An “isotopic fingerprint” allows for identification of a pangolin’s geographic home: each environmental zone has its own unique “isoscape”, which can be matched with that of an animal. This technology can be used to identify the origin of confiscated pangolin scales, helping to crack down on smuggling routes.The billion-dollar illegal trade in wild animals is now the world’s fourth largest criminal business, after arms, drugs and human trafficking. As the trade is highly mobile with new trade routes emerging every year, the wildlife conservation organisation Traffic recommends international collaboration between source, destination and transit countries in intelligence-led investigations. “We are basically fighting on our own at the moment. And we still haven’t been able to win this war,” says White, who has spearheaded Gabon’s fight against wildlife crimes and, in particular, ivory trafficking for the past three decades.He would like to see more engagement from his European counterparts in the fight to stop international pangolin trafficking. “Thus far, I don’t get the impression that the law enforcement community in most European countries thinks of wildlife crimes particularly seriously.”Traffic reports that most scales smuggled to China from Cameroon or Nigeria are routed through European airports.José Antonio Alfaro Moreno, a senior specialist for environmental crime at Europol, supports law enforcement agencies across Europe with anti-trafficking operations. “Wildlife crime is a new priority area in the European Union,” he says, adding that agencies are working with a variety of new methods, including using sniffer dogs to detect smuggled animals and animal parts.“You need to prove to the court that this is the actual species and no other,” he says, noting the importance of lab-based techniques to identify species. Whereas DNA analysis is common, stable isotope analysis is not yet implemented by most countries.State-of-the-art forensics technology – such as radiocarbon dating and X-ray fluorescence – is already being used to effectively trace illegal timber trading and to target illicit rhino horn and ivory syndicates.“Wildlife forensics is a rapidly developing area, and with good reason,” says Richard Thomas, Traffic’s Head of Communications. “The application of forensic techniques to wildlife crime can provide the same sort of insights as it does to solving regular criminal cases.”Behaviour change on the demand side is equally critical for the conservation of pangolins, says Thomas: “Wildlife crime is perceived as low risk-high benefit: it’s a mindset that needs to be changed. Meanwhile, it’s consumer demand that fuels the trade: change consumer behaviour and you change the whole trade.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e58c6b075634a4380adf83b7aeeaa46be8ba43d0/610_438_4592_2755/master/4592.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=0d09004342940742eb7ff2284b3eef72","title":"marcus rashford scores cover of british vogues september issue","story":"The footballer is recognised for his activism in the magazine among 40 ‘faces of hope’Marcus Rashford’s inspirational, policy-changing campaign against child poverty has garnered him accolades aplenty. Now it has also propelled the footballer on to the front cover of British Vogue’s September issue.The Manchester United striker, who forced a government U-turn on the granting of free food vouchers for the poorest families over the summer, headlines a special edition dedicated to activism.Rashford posed alongside Adwoa Aboah, the supermodel turned mental health activist, for the Activism Now issue. While Aboah has graced Vogue on several occasions, it’s a first time for Rashford.The footballer said: “I’m by no means a politician but I had a voice and a platform that could be used to at least ask the questions. If I didn’t put myself out there and say, ‘This is not OK and it needs to change,’ I would have failed my 10-year-old self.”The photograph was shot by Misan Harriman, the first black male photographer to shoot a cover of British Vogue in the magazine’s 104-year history. A predominantly black team was on set for the shoot.Rashford, whose campaigning has led to him becoming the youngest recipient of an honorary doctorate from the University of Manchester, and Aboah, who founded the online mental health community Gurls Talk, head up the issue, which throws a spotlight on 40 “faces of hope”.They include the campaigner Doreen Lawrence, the mother of Stephen Lawrence  the American political activist Angela Davis the Sudanese student and anti-government protester Alaa Salah the British youth-enterprise campaigner Temi Mwale and the Justice4Grenfell campaigner Yvette Williams.The September issue of Vogue is regarded as the most important of the calendar. This year all 26 international Vogues are dedicating their issues to the theme of hope.“British Vogue’s interpretation is an ode to the extraordinary voices, the majority of whom are women, who have been critical to driving change forward,” the magazine said in a statement.British Vogue’s editor-in-chief, Edward Enninful, said: “At its core, British Vogue’s September issue is our show of thanks, as well as a rallying cry for the future. When all is said and done, it’s clear that 2020 will be remembered as a tough year, but also as a moment of necessary change. One thing is for certain. The future starts now.”Others highlighted include the American fashion model Bethann Hardison, known for her activism on ersity in the fashion industry Brianna Agyemang and Jamila Thomas, the two young music executives behind the “Blackout Tuesday” social media protest in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and Patrick Hutchinson, the BLM protester photographed carrying a white football supporter to safety during anti-racist protests.British Vogue has also organised two activist roundtable talks. The first, hosted by Aboah, discusses community activism. The second, released on Wednesday, and introduced by Enninful, will be hosted by entertainment and sports agent Darnell Strom and will discuss 2020 as a watershed year for activism.As well as being the first black man to shoot a British Vogue cover, Harriman is the first black photographer to claim a prestigious September cover. Nadine Ijewere was the first black female photographer to shoot a cover of British Vogue, with covers in January 2019 and August 2020.Harriman said: “To be the first black male photographer in British Vogue’s 104-year history to shoot a cover is an honour, but let’s be clear, this has Edward Enninful written all over it. His ability to force change whilst empowering others is a lesson to us all. He knows that there are many talented people from a erse background who have never had a fair chance – finally the door is ajar.”Last year’s September British Vogue cover was guest-edited by the Duchess of Sussex."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6eba7b436017169102b6a5b6328605d19a29972/4_1628_3146_1888/master/3146.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5af70cf5e9f55197b8562ddc39bb79ae","title":"parts unknown whole animal recipes from feather and bone","story":"From crispy pig’s ear banh mi to butter lamb tongue, cooking with unusual animal parts may seem intimidating – but it can be easy and deliciousTraditional whole-animal butcheries have become a rarity in many developed countries.The overwhelming majority of domestic and export meat in Australia is traded through the commodity meat market. Much of the meat produced for this market will be sourced from farms that are organised around the primary goal of maximising turnover of animals. As a system that rewards volume and speed, it works brilliantly.But if you’re a farmer or butcher or consumer interested in other dimensions of value, such as traceable animal and environmental welfare standards, then it will come up short. This is because when a farmer sells into the mainstream commodity market, their animals disappear into a generic product pool.Filled with crusading zeal for a better food model, we decided that our commitment to transparency and a whole-animal practice meant two things. First, we would seek out erse breeds of animals grown on farms managed with the goal of improving the entire ecosystem. Second, we wouldn’t buy boxed meat from a wholesaler, but instead would always buy meat on the bone direct from the farmer, offal and all.Of course, if your business is built around buying the whole animal, then you also have to sell it, which can be challenging. Many of us have lost the traditional skills that allowed us to prepare and consume the whole animal. Eating offal was something quaint our grandparents did, and these days we spend more time watching cooking shows than we actually do preparing food. All of this means we default to the cuts we know how to cook, and we’re less likely to choose the unfamiliar ones.Change is hard and change is slow but from little things big things grow.Feeds: 4-6 Active prep: 15 minutesCook: 8 hoursChill: Up to 24 hours“When we first started selling our pastured pork, I had only been eating meat for about seven years, after a decade of vegetarianism, and was determined to make use of every part of the animals we raise with such care. And so my crispy pig’s ear banh mi was born, of necessity and respect, inspired by regular visits to Vietnam over the years. Banh mi are best when there is a balance of fat, fresh, sweet, sour, salt and spice, all wrapped up in a crispy baguette with a soft centre. These crispy pig’s ear banh mi capture that formula perfectly, and also leave room for everyone at the table to self-determine their own ratios of each constituent flavour.”– Tammi Jonas, producer and activistFor the pigs’ ears4 pasture-raised pigs’ ears1 leek, coarsely chopped3 garlic cloves, lightly crushed, still in skin50g palm sugar300ml pasture-raised pork bone broth or chicken stock200ml Shaoxing rice wine200ml soy sauce6 star anise1 cinnamon stick3 eggsPlain (all-purpose) flour, for dusting60g panko breadcrumbsLard or rendered animal fat, for deep-fryingFor the banh mi4-6 fried eggsFreshly made mayonnaise or aioli, to serve40g lightly pickled carrot2 cucumbers, cut into batonsLong red chilli, coarsely chopped, to tasteCoriander leaves, to serveFish sauce, to serveCrusty baguette or white rolls, to serveStart this recipe one or two days ahead. Preheat oven to 120C (235F). Place pigs’ ears in an ovenproof dish with leek, garlic, sugar, broth or stock, Shaoxing, soy sauce and spices. Cover with baking paper, seal tightly with foil, and braise for about eight hours, or overnight, until very tender.Place ears on a cooling rack in the fridge to dry out for up to one day.

My first cooking job was to make the Saturday morning butcher’s breakfast, before I did the deliveries. So I used whatever morsels were around – liver, ends of bacon, kidneys, little lamb chops – fried them up in an old electric frying pan, then served them on a slab of thickly buttered bread. It was a tough gig, as butchers don’t like their meat ruined, so timing was everything. I love good fresh liver, served medium–rare, with jammy onion and pan-roasted tomatoes. Sear the liver at the last minute while the sourdough bread is toasting.”– Christopher Hodges, Feather and Bone customer40g butter, plus extra for spreading2 tablespoons olive oil2-4 brown onions (1 per person), diced250g cherry tomatoes, halved1 lamb, goat or calf (veal) liver, rinsed, membrane removed, sliced into 1.5cm strips1 handful flat-leaf parsley leaves, chopped2-4 slices sourdough breadAdd a generous knob of butter to a frying pan over medium-high heat. Swirl for two to three minutes until lightly browned, then add a good dash of olive oil. Add onion and a large pinch of salt, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring gently, for 15-20 minutes. The onion will slowly turn golden, then brown, sweet and yummy.Meanwhile, heat a separate frying pan over medium-high heat. Add tomatoes – they’ll sizzle as they hit the pan – then add a bit more butter, season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper, and cook, turning once, for five minutes or until lightly browned and juicy.Drizzle liver all over with remaining olive oil. Heat a heavy-based frying pan over medium-high heat, add liver and sear it quickly, without turning, for one minute until sealed and caramelised a little, then turn it quickly and sear for another minute until nicely browned but still rare in the middle. Transfer to a plate, season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper and top with parsley, then cover with an upturned bowl or a lid – it will keep cooking so by the time you serve it will be cooked through but still pink in the middle.Meanwhile, toast sourdough in a toaster.

Slice tongues thinly lengthwise – you should get about four slices per tongue.Meanwhile, to make vinaigrette, warm crushed Sichuan pepper in oil in a small saucepan over low heat for three to five minutes or until fragrant – be careful, it can burn quickly. Remove from heat and steep for 10 minutes to extract all the fragrance.

You can bet some of the best clubs in Europe are doing exactly that, trying to brainstorm ways of persuading Leicester to sell an exceptional forward before his value soars beyond reach, if it has not already. There has been constant yakking about the attractiveness of James Maddison, Ben Chilwell and Wilfried Ndidi to Champions League participants, but Barnes belongs in that conversation too.When Barnes is on his game, he is one of those thrilling players who show that being creative first means being destructive. He is not in the same class as the 24-year-old Adama Traoré but he is not far off and at 22 is ahead of where the Wolves man was at the same age in terms of impact on the Premier League. Both players can make even the sturdiest defenders looks like old gates flapping in a storm. They are rapid, powerful, skilful and audacious and there is every reason to believe Barnes is as committed to improving and as receptive to good coaching as Traoré is. It takes clever men to cause as much chaos as these two regularly do.Which brings us to the other reason why clubs will mention Barnes this summer. If his future excites, his past illuminates. He is a choice example of how young players can benefit from loan moves, which are likely to be used more frequently than ever during the new financial reality inflicted by Covid-19.Barnes’s talent has been carefully honed. He has been at Leicester since the age of nine. After he made his senior debut in a Champions League defeat by Porto four years ago when he was 18, he really started making strides when he went out on loan thereafter, enjoying successful spells at progressively higher levels, from MK Dons through to Barnsley and West Brom. “He is probably the perfect example of the loan and development process,” says Dean Hammond, who was Leicester’s loan manager when Barnes was being nurtured. Hammond helped to plan loan moves and would study Barnes’s progress, giving feedback to the player and parent club.“Harvey was easy to manage because he wanted to be a player,” says Hammond, who left Leicester in November to take care of his family while his wife recovered from a back operation. “He has real natural ability and he works really hard. He understood the process of development. He scored more goals and got more assists at West Brom but in terms of traits and technique, his performances were very similar at MK Dons and Barnsley. He’s very fast and very direct. He likes to commit players, take them on.“He likes the responsibility of taking on a shot, trying to slide a striker through or putting a cross in. He’s very forward-thinking. When he receives the ball, his first thought is to dribble forward. So a lot of the clips I’d make of him were very good and exciting to watch.”But he was not perfect. “With Harvey, like with most young players, it was more about understanding the other side of the game, the defensive positioning. I know from my own time as a player that positional sense – learning to be in different situations – is the hardest thing to develop. At West Brom, sometimes Harvey would play the No 10 role, sometimes he’d be on the left wing and cut inside and sometimes he’d play on the right. So he was learning different positions. So you had to develop his positional sense.“You also had to teach him how to be effective every time he got the ball and how to be effective in different ways. It’s not contradictory to say it’s great to watch him take on a shot, slide a striker through or beat two or three players but you don’t always have to do that. There are times to just do a simple bounce pass or maybe keep the ball for a minute or two.”Barnes grew into such a force at West Brom that Leicester recalled him in January 2019. He demonstrated his threat in his first start after his return, appearing to score against Wolves before the goal was credited to Conor Coady.Brendan Rodgers replaced Claude Puel as Leicester manager a month later and has made Barnes a regular part of Leicester’s attack. His 36 appearances in the 2019-20 Premier League season included 25 as a starter. Usually he raids from the left wing but that he can strike the ball beautifully with either foot means defenders are seldom sure which way to direct him, if they get the choice.

It was also clear in the early part of the season the youngster needed to find more composure in the box, although anyone who saw the purity of his goal against Sheffield United last August might not believe that.Like Traoré before him, Barnes has learned to steady himself before delivering the final blow. Although he is still not as consistent as he is likely to become, Barnes was one of the few Leicester players who got better from January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e4dc93f1c705fe658f32e45fc31e88b9a653a18/0_216_1440_864/master/1440.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac3f7e5937eb5b7ce49aed3a7e658c6d","title":"mexico bicentenario los pilares dam indigenous","story":"Local residents say the government has pressured them to hand over their lands: ‘They’re destroying our culture’High in the Sierra de Alamos of Mexico’s northern Sonora state, towering pillars of rock loom above thermal springs where for thousands of years, the indigenous Guarijío people would gather to commune with their ancestors.Now the springs – and the land around them – have been submerged beneath rising waters trapped behind an enormous dam across the Mayo River. The 25-storey Bicentenario-Los Pilares barrier threatens to displace the living, and leave the graves of their forefathers deep under water.“The government are leaving us with nothing,” said Wilfrido, a member of the Guarijío community in the village of Macarahui, and the leader of one of 53 families who are resisting the dam. “They’re not taking us into account. They say that negotiations should be government-to-government – but they’re not talking to our traditional leader.”The Sonora state government first presented the plan in 2011: an ambitious project that would involve building a 78-meter-high barrier and would flood nine villages.Local residents say that the government and other supporters of the project pressured them to hand over their lands, creating fierce isions among the 3,000-strong Guarijío community. Some have supported the dam, but the group’s traditional leaders remain opposed to the project.Despite the opposition, work began at the site in 2013, with an initial investment of some US$67m. The Guarijíos launched a legal attempt to block the project, arguing that their collective rights had been violated and that the dam threatened the group’s survival, but construction continued.Opponents of the dam had hoped that the election of a leftwing president could change things: when Andrés Manuel López Obrador took power in December 2018, 68 indigenous groups awarded him a ceremonial staff, in an unprecedented vote of confidence in the leader.But the president, popularly known as Amlo, has thrown his support behind a string of controversial megaprojects on or near indigenous land, including highways, reservoirs, mining projects, oil refineries, housing projects and a 1,460km “Mayan Train” railway which critics say threatens unique jungle ecosystems in southern Mexico.After a six-year legal fight, opponents of the dam won a court ruling in their favour in February 2019, but three months later, Amlo declared that federal funding would be released in order to finish the dam “as soon as possible”.In October, Amlo announced a consultation process with the Guajiríos – but also released 600m pesos of funding for the project and said the government would approve the necessary licenses to complete it.Speaking at an event titled Dialogues with the Indigenous Peoples, Amlo said: “This will all depend on you, the Guarijíos, because nothing will be imposed,” before quoting Mexico’s only indigenous president, Benito Juárez: “Nothing by force, all by reason and law.”But the only Guajiríos invited to the event were those who already supported the project opponents of the project were left protesting outside.“The whole process has been riddled with irregularities,” said the anthropologist Armando Haro, an advisor to the Guarijíos since 2011. “The Guarijíos have been pressured and cheated into surrendering their land rights and signing sales contracts through promises which have not been kept.”Speaking by telephone from the village of Macarahui, Wilfrido, 49, a farmer with four children, said local residents were under pressure not to speak out against the project. “We’ve had threats they say they’re going to run us out of here. People are scared to stay here.”Some 3,000 Guarajíos live in a handful of remote villages scattered across the Sierra Madre Occidental. They have survived conquest, drought, hunger, government neglect and incursions by drug traffickers who cultivate marijuana in the deep valleys of the mountain range.But the dam is perhaps the greatest challenge they have faced so far.“We want the president to listen to our traditional governors – to hear what state this megaproject will leave us in,” said Wilfrido. “If they set out to destroy us, they’re already succeeding. They’re destroying our land, our culture, our people.”As the tribe waited for a response from the government, work on the dam continued, and the floodgates on the dam were closed in early July. On Thursday, Amlo will head to Sonora, where first he will officially apologize to the indigenous Yaqui people who were subjected to a genocide in the 19th century – and then to officially inaugurate the Bicentenario-Los Pilares dam.The rising water has already cut off the Guajiríos’ route to their herds of cattle and nearby roads.But alongside farmland and homes, the Guarijíos history and heritage also faces obliteration: pre-Columbian petroglyphs, ceremonial sites and a swathe of riverside territory rich in medicinal plants will all be lost beneath the rising waters.“Our holy places have already been flooded,” said Wilfrido. “Our village is dying, our culture is dying – and our hope is dying.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad75ea18ba8ce7e2c60ca1eb9d265b8cb64e285a/0_0_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=874803c25a4d40a637d41e96122c6984","title":"water is sacred 10 visual artists reflect on the human right to water","story":"The UN declared access to water and sanitation a human right a decade ago, but 785 million people worldwide still have no water close to homeTen photographs marking the 10th anniversary of access to water and sanitation being declared a human right by the UN have been commissioned from 10 visual artists by the charity WaterAid to show the impact of clean water on people’s lives.Globally, 785 million people – one in 10 – still lack access to water close to home and 2 billion people – one in four – don’t have a toilet of their own.For many communities, water sources are usually far from their homes, and it falls to women and girls to spend much of their time and energy fetching water, a task that can expose them to attack from men or wild animals.Without sanitation people have no choice but to use communal latrines or find a place to go to the toilet outside, often having to wait until the cover of darkness. This leaves food and water resources open to infections and helps spread disease.This work references Nigerian-Yoruba sculptures and the healing qualities of water as a basic element of life. Yoruba believe water to be a symbol of force and strength.“This piece centres around the role of women and girls in society. Despite the significance of their contribution, women and girls have for generations been held captive by patriarchy.“I adopted a picture of a young woman carrying a load of empty jerrycans in search for clean water to cater for her family.“I thought that the model’s portrait would depict the plight of underprivileged women and children while the jerrycan denotes consumerism. Africa’s socioeconomic drive is so dependent on hard-working yet underprivileged women and children.”“Water allows us to celebrate, to relax, to socialise, to be joyful. This is a quality that we in the western world easily take for granted. My work very much talks about quality of life related to water and how access to clean water is essential for our soul as well as for our body.“I immediately thought of rain and how water falls from the sky that we all share. I then remembered taking photographs of people playing under the rain in Mexico … The water looked like stars.”“I wanted to create art that would represent the anguish and violence that go along with our planet’s problems. People do not realise how their own suffering is tied to the environment: to their long trip to fetch water, or their discomfort under the heat when the streets have no trees. Ghana is facing some of the most detrimental consequences from climate change and water shortages. Yet the government does nothing, so I have taken it upon myself to educate through art.”“My response is a reflection on how many of us, particularly when living in the west, we take the bathroom and easy access to water for granted.“Even those we consider despotic have easy access to such sanitation, while this is a right denied for many women and girls around the world, particularly those in the global south.”“The initial idea came from the constant reminders to wash hands and the NHS step-by-step guide during the time of coronavirus. I noticed that the steps to prevent the spread of the virus were dependent on three key things, clean running water from a tap (ideally with a modern faucet that could be turned off by using your elbow and not your hands), a soap dispenser with liquid soap and disposable paper towels. All of these are not universally accessible, even within the UK.“The sea reminds us that everyone is connected and that water is sacred.”“In the past, Bonthe was a thriving trade hub and economic centre. In the 80s, palm products and seafood became major industries. But like a sun-bleached photo taken of an exotic island town, where you can see things once were bright and new, now all that’s left is a vague image of what used to be. During the world wars the French and English navy used the town as a naval base. This Victorian water pump is a reminder that the right to clean water and decent toilets is a luxury afforded only to those who are fortunate.“The time to change this is now. Taking a moment to show gratitude for this seemingly basic right every time you wash your hands or take a shower adds another drop of water to the sea of change.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/929ec0d3305be22574c3cd26e5c9cee0d820f84a/0_0_4999_3000/master/4999.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da51e6ac4c389858dc3282db595f1406","title":"the teacher the baker and the snack box maker meet the small firms going online for the first time","story":"Since lockdown, websites have become the main source of income for many small businesses and microbusinesses. Over the next month, we’ll follow two company owners, and the mentors we’ve paired them with, as they find their feet in the digital worldDespite never selling online in the 10 years since he cofounded his artisan bakery Bread Source, Steven Winter was left with little choice when the coronavirus lockdown was announced in March. As restaurants closed, the wholesale arm of the business disappeared, and he had no idea what was going to happen to his four shops or his market stalls across Norwich and Aylsham. “At that point there was no furlough scheme. All I was trying to do was pay my 30 staff,” Winter says.The response to the new website, which launched at the start of April, blew him away. “In the first week or two, we were up to 200 orders a day,” he says. “We sold 10,000 loaves, 25,000 pastries and 10 tonnes of flour online over two months.” The team expanded their range to include other staples such as eggs, milk, butter and coffee, which were dropped off to customers across Norfolk using the bakery’s two delivery vans.Winter was also mindful of making good food available to his hospitality colleagues, many of whom had lost their jobs. He introduced a National Loaf scheme, inspired by a product conceived by the Federation of Bakers in 1942 to keep the country fed during the second world war. Today, Winter is selling the nutritious loaf for £1 and he is now hoping to expand the initiative nationwide.Sakshi Anand, senior director for GoDaddy UK, says Covid-19 has provided many small businesses with the impetus to get online, driving what’s becoming known as a second digital revolution: “One of the biggest barriers is people think it’s really complicated”, she says about launching a website. “Most microbusiness owners run finance, the technology and marketing, they’re doing everything. But once you start seeing sales coming or you see other businesses who are thriving from it, you realise it’s something you definitely need. And with GoDaddy’s drag-and-drop marketing tools, you can have a fully functioning website online in 24-48 hours.”For Winter, it’s been transformational – the online demand covered the sales the bakery would have made if it had been business as usual. He’s keen to make the business’s digital channel a permanent feature, and will be using this opportunity to develop an email marketing campaign for the 5,000 customers on the bakery’s database, experiment with pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, and explore widening its audience beyond the local market. He’ll be supported by Rosie Mills-Smith, Bread Source’s marketing lead, GoDaddy Guides – a 6,000-strong team providing bespoke support to small business owners – and a suite of digital tools. He and Mills-Smith are mindful of the need to scale their new retail channel in a sustainable way. “I think probably the hardest thing has been going from dealing with three or four enquiries a day on social media and via email, to literally thousands more,” says Mills-Smith.In Bath, yoga and meditation teacher Lucy Stone has been inspired to launch her new website because of the popularity of her free guided meditation videos, posted on Facebook during the pandemic. “When I started there were 10 or 15 people and then each video was getting 1,000 views. It was amazing,” she says.She’ll now work with GoDaddy’s Guides to design and launch a dedicated website for Meditation Rocks. She plans to provide guided meditation for children and adults via free videos, and to offer more in-depth courses, for which she’ll charge. She’s also open to the idea of launching a blog and adding an online shop to sell merchandise.One of the challenges she knows she’ll face in growing her brand is attracting new customers, and dealing with the image of meditation. “Yoga has come a long way in the past 15 years or so, it’s become very cool,” she says. “Meditation is still playing catch up … there’s a lot of misunderstanding about what it is and what it does.”But she won’t be alone as she makes plans for Meditation Rocks. To help Stone and, indeed, Steven Winter at Bread Source to nail their digital futures, we’ve paired each of them with a mentor who can offer expert advice.Stone will be supported by yoga and meditation teacher Nadia Narain. With a client list that has included Rachel Weisz, Kate Moss, Jools Oliver, and the Arsenal football team, Narain has been teaching yoga since 1996. She was one of Triyoga’s original teachers when the studio opened in London in 2000. She is also an author, has a range of DVDs, developed her own perfume and aromatherapy candles, and recently launched an online course promoting self care during lockdown, with her sister Katia.“I always think of yoga as my love,” says Narain. “And I’m so lucky that I get to do it.” She enjoys mentoring other teachers and says monetisation is something a lot of people ask her about.The mentor paired with Winter is Anthony Fletcher, chief executive of Graze. He has led the healthy-snacks company for the past seven years, as it expanded into markets such as the US, Ireland and the Netherlands, and into UK retail outlets including Boots, WH Smith and Waitrose.“The wonderful thing about digital is it’s intuitive,” he adds. “So go and spend £20 on marketing. If it works well, spend £40 the next day. If nothing resonates, maybe you change things around and try something a bit different ... The obvious advantage that small businesses have is agility, and the ability to set off in a new direction. But I think we’ve crossed the Rubicon with Covid-19. People want to buy local, people want to know who’s behind the business. They’ll back you if they buy into who you are and what you’re trying to do.”GoDaddy launched the #OpenWeStand initiative offering a number of free tools, widgets, resources and blogposts at OpenWeStand.org to help small businesses keep their digital doors open while their physical doors are closed.

However, as lockdown restrictions ease, localised rises in new case numbers notwithstanding, advertisers are expected to return.“As we transition into a less-restricted environment, we expect spend to pick up significantly as brands once again vie to be front of mind with consumers,” Farmer said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/941263e59caedc9535d0c7b4de2e4fa295f72022/459_75_4702_2821/master/4702.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73778a96d94fb7969fa8f709ee928a8f","title":"how did virgin media manage to lose my email account","story":"It was all there on Saturday and gone by Monday without any warningIn late April my @virgin.net email account, which has been my main one for 20-plus years, disappeared.

He replied immediately, enabling her daughter to complete the task. Brown was impressed – it felt like one-to-one tutoring, but Daisy was attending school online via her Microsoft Surface, studying from the family’s kitchen table.Before the school closures, it was impossible to imagine children decamping from classrooms to embark on online learning, and harder still to picture parents as proxy teachers. Yet for Brown and other parents, this is the new normal. Technology is making it possible allowing teaching to continue uninterrupted, enhancing students’ creativity, productivity and collaboration, and enabling parents to engage with their children’s learning journey.Brown works as a support staff member at her daughter’s school, and considers the school’s remote-learning provision the silver lining to the cloud that is the current crisis. “Daisy joins her form group every morning via video link, then follows her normal timetable – it’s working fantastically,” she says. “It’s lovely to hear her classmates chatting away and helping one another with their work.”Distance learning isn’t new. But the pandemic has drastically accelerated the development of online education, and technology is at the forefront of this modern educational reform. Microsoft Teams – used in 175 countries by 183,000 institutions – is equipping students with a learning environment that is accessible, inclusive and collaborative.For parents thrust into the role of home educator, it’s natural to feel anxious. But supporting your child’s online education doesn’t mean replicating the school environment. Melanie Dalpra from Reading, whose daughter, Maia, is in year 11, says: “Even Maia’s school isn’t trying to replicate it – she has three 45-minute online lessons and the rest of her day is given to independent study.“I think that’s a really good model – don’t let Covid-19 push your child out of the centre of their education.”Safeguarding is also a key consideration for parents. As education moves online and children rely on technology tools for learning, parents need peace of mind that the devices they use are equipped with world-class security measures. Microsoft offers tools for every task with security built in, from chip to cloud.A particular advantage of Windows 10 Pro is its inbuilt security solution, including streamlined security updates, safe searches and no retargeting of students with online adverts – features parents may already be familiar with through the tools they use at work. Microsoft 365 allows users to move seamlessly and securely from one device to another without complexity.For home-learning to be effective, Ciaran O’Halloran, head of drama at Our Lady and St Patrick’s college in Knock, Belfast, recommends focusing on healthy routines rather than slavishly following the school timetable. “A lot of the things that happen in school happen in order to manage hundreds of people effectively,” he says. “We spend a lot of time organising and socialising children so they can function in the school environment but without that, parents can be much more responsive.”Parents who want to support their child’s online learning do not need in-depth knowledge of the topics their child is studying, either. “I certainly don’t know everything and my kids know that,” laughs Dalpra. “You’re not an encyclopaedia we look things up together and they’re learning to ask for help, which is a really useful life skill.”With so little time to prepare for online learning, many households find themselves sharing limited resources. But Microsoft apps have the advantage of being accessible on all devices – meaning students can begin work in one place and move to another device seamlessly as required, reducing pressure on the main family device.“Microsoft apps don’t necessarily require children to work within them,” says O’Halloran. “A screenshot of task instructions on Teams can be viewed on a phone.”Equipping young learners with tools that enhance productivity and enable collaboration in this way – at the same time as encouraging them to flex their creativity – is key to developing the cognitive and problem-solving skills that will benefit them throughout life.For some children, online learning offers unexpected respite from the challenges of going to school. Dalpra, whose three children have Asperger syndrome, ADHD and dyspraxia respectively, says quarantine can create opportunities to reconsider your child’s needs. “One of the advantages of online learning is that you can control sensory stimulus and adapt learning materials to suit the needs of inidual learners,” she says.An inclusive learning experience is vital for all young people. Giving your child access to tools that include special features to address a range of inidual needs is essential, especially for those with specific learning needs. Free accessibility tools – such as Immersive Reader – are built in to all Microsoft products to help empower students of all abilities to learn without stigma and at their own pace. Immersive Reader provides a full-screen reading experience, designed to increase readability of text – students can change spacing, read text aloud, and sound out words by syllable.It’s difficult to imagine schools reverting to business as usual, and the new educational landscape will surely continue posing challenges for parents. But whatever the future holds, the technology is on their side. For parents worried about how to adapt and survive, Dalpra has a pearl of wisdom: “Children develop if they’re in a nourishing environment, and just feeling heard can transform a child’s education.”Five tips to support online education1. Put mental health and wellbeing above academic progress. If learning isn’t going well, play a board game or go for a walk together and revisit the task later. The Do Not Disturb function in Teams can also help with children’s concentration.2. Have fun. This is a difficult time for children, but learning should be enjoyable.3. Encourage your child to ask teachers for help – not all children are used to doing so.4. Stick to a daily routine but allow time for play, relaxation and boredom.5. Remember that you’re dealing with a person, not just a student. Show your child that you’re still learning too, and approach it together.Interested in finding out more about how to support your child’s online learning experience?

It was the most fun he’d had yet as PMThe timing couldn’t have been more perfect. The second full day of recess and an emergency Downing Street press conference to announce that coronavirus wasn’t going to be all over by Christmas after all had ensured that little attention had been paid to Boris Johnson’s “summer holiday” peerages list.For Boris it had been the most fun he’d had since becoming prime minister a year ago. The chance to make good on his promise to level up the country by rewarding friends and family with jobs for life. It had, though, taken him a while to get into the swing of things.“I thought we had promised to reduce the numbers in the Lords, not increase them,” Boris had said to Dominic Cummings.“That’s what every prime minister says when he or she comes into office, so obviously we will say we remain committed to reducing the numbers while increasing them,” Classic Dom had replied. “Nobody can resist a bit of patronage once they get the chance. So just get stuck in and enjoy yourself.”Unusually for Boris, he started off somewhat cautiously, with peerages for Ken Clarke and Philip Hammond. Just to prove he had no lingering resentments towards two former MPs he couldn’t stand and had effectively thrown out of the Commons by withdrawing the party whip. Still, it wasn’t as if they would be in a position to do much harm in the Lords. Just a bit of box-ticking here and there.Then there had been something for Nigel Dodds. The least he could do after first stitching up the DUP over Northern Ireland in the Brexit withdrawal agreement and then calling a general election in which the DUP leader had lost his seat.“Don’t forget the money men,” Dom reminded him. “We wouldn’t want people to get the idea that donating large amounts of cash to the Tory party was no longer a safe way in to the House of Lords.” Michael Spencer’s name was hastily added to the list.As was Edward Lister’s. Steady Eddie had stood by him for years and was now his chief of staff. And hopefully most people would have forgotten his possible conflict of interest when he pocketed £487,000 from a Malaysian property developer when he was the £68k-per-year chairman of Homes England, a government body set up to fund affordable housing. There again, who really cared if they hadn’t.Boris hastily rattled his way through a few more names. He was tempted to leave out Charles Moore simply because the former editor of the Spectator had had his heart set on a peerage since he was 15 and it would have been great to disappoint him, but then largesse had won the day. Besides, Moore would be bound to be even more slavishly supportive in ermine.There also had to be something for Gisela Stuart. The former Labour MP had done her bit by keeping quiet as Boris and Michael Gove had told lie after lie on the Vote Leave campaign bus in 2016 and she could probably use the £300 per day. He’d heard she was down on her luck. Talking of which, Kate Hoey ought to make it on the list. Not because he particularly admired her – no one did – but because it would upset almost every Labour voter.“This just isn’t really doing it for me,” said Dom. “I mean, it’s OK. We have a decent haul of objectionable people. But we need to do better, with some really big names. Names that will really prove to everyone that we are taking the piss big time. That we really don’t give a shit what anyone thinks. So let me give you some suggestions. Evgeny Lebedev, for example.”“You’re kidding me,” Boris replied. “He’s really only famous for giving lavish parties to posh people – just remember the state I was in when I got back from Perugia – and he’s the son of a former KGB agent. We’ll never get away with this just a week after the ISC report highlighting excessive levels of infiltration into British political life by Russian oligarchs.”“Just watch us. And then you could also go for Claire Fox.”“Wasn’t she a member of the Revolutionary Communist party who said the Bosnian genocide was fake news, has refused to apologise for defending the IRA bombing in Warrington and is dedicated to overthrowing the House of Lords?”“Sure, but they all say that until they’re asked to join the club. Now she’s a rightwing rent-a-gob who will do anything for a bit of attention.”“OK, you’re on,” said Boris, warming to his task. “Then let’s also include Ian Botham. Not for his cricketing achievements, obviously, but just because he’s a Brexiteer who became so boring he was even dropped from the Sky commentary team.”“Loving it,” said Classic Dom. “Talking of boring, how about we also appoint a former Tory MP who was so spectacularly forgettable he never achieved anything of any importance throughout his entire career?”“The very same. Can you imagine anyone who will be more useless as a peer? Present company excluded of course.”Eventually Boris had decided on 35 names, along with a knighthood for Philip May. Couldn’t have Philip thinking he was in the same league as Denis Thatcher, who got a hereditary peerage just for putting up with Maggie. But he could still do with one more name. Then it came to him. The People’s Government had done corruption, incompetence and cronyism, but somehow nepotism had been overlooked. Within seconds he was on the phone to his brother.“I’m making you a peer, Jo,” he said.“But what for? I haven’t done anything.”“That’s the whole point, old boy. Besides, you haven’t done any less than some of the others on my list.”“Dad will go bonkers. He’s desperate for a peerage.”“I know. But it will be great to make him sweat for another year or two.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61345c75dc90e987eb43e4009482fe5a9b071cbc/0_278_5298_3178/master/5298.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=84d06771b225859d35b749b509eeba83","title":"number of uk citizens emigrating to eu has risen by 30 since brexit vote","story":"Analysis of data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Eurostat shows that migration from Britain to EU states averaged 56,832 people a year in 2008-15, growing to 73,642 a year in 2016-18.“These increases in numbers are of a magnitude that you would expect when a country is hit by a major economic or political crisis,” said Daniel Auer, co-author of the study by Oxford University in Berlin and the Berlin Social Science Center.According to interviews, half chose to leave the UK quickly. “Another important finding from the empirical evidence associated with Brexit is reduced levels of consideration and level-headedness in decision-making, with increases in levels of impulsiveness, spontaneity and corresponding risk-taking,” the researchers said.While the withdrawal agreement signed in January enshrines the residency, work and social rights of EU citizens in the UK and Britons in the rest of the bloc, it failed to guarantee the free movement rights of British migrants, restricting future employment and residency prospects in other member states.Co-author Daniel Tetlow said that “Brexit was by far the most dominant driver of migration decisions since 2016”. The jump in citizenship was “further evidence that an increasing number are making migration decisions to protect themselves from some of the most negative effects of Brexit on their lives”, the report said.The key loss for British nationals is the freedom to move country within the EU or to work or offer services across a border. This does not apply to EU nationals in the UK who retain free movement rights beyond Brexit courtesy of their EU member state citizenship.It means that unless British nationals take out citizenship in their host country, they can no longer work in or offer a service to another EU member state, impacting professions including accounting, law, architecture, translation and health.The biggest jump in migration was to Spain, where an estimated 380,000 British nationals live. Registration has not been essential in the country so many have lived there without being included in official Spanish immigration data, with an average of just 2,300 a year registering as migrating to the country between 2008 and 2015. After the referendum, this jumped fivefold, with 21,250 registrations in the two years between 2016 and 2018.The second most popular country for British nationals was France, which does not require registration of EU migrants. Between 2008 and 2015 the number of registrations was just over 500 a year. After the referendum this rose tenfold with 5,000 registrations over the following two years.In Germany, 14,600 Britons had dual nationality in 2019 compared to 622 in 2015. A total of 31,600 applied and received German citizenship in the three years after the referendum (2016 to 2019) with another 15,000 German passports expected for 2020. Overall half the estimated 120,000 Britons in Germany are expected to have dual citizenship by the end of this year.Interviews with migrants in Germany for the study found those who had made the move to the EU since 2015 considered it a “big risk” but were prepared to make the trade-off to secure future residency and employment routes across 27 countries.Tetlow said the rise in naturalisation numbers was a striking commitment “to integrate or socially embed”, with an increase in language learning and community involvement. “We’re observing a new social integration phenomenon and a redefining of what it means to be British European. In 2019, Brits came in just behind Turks in numbers receiving German citizenship – way ahead of Poles, Romanians, Iraqis or Syrians,” he added.Andreas Mitchell’s family moved from Scotland to Germany in 2018 after the 20-year-old was diagnosed with a form of leukaemia and they feared Brexit could delay medicines or treatment.Andreas said: “About six months after the referendum I was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. I was getting treatment but these kind of things can start deteriorating over the years, and eventually we decided we should probably leave in case things started to get difficult.“We had a fear that if a hard Brexit came there could be delays at the border with medicines coming through and my treatment would have to be prioritised and it would get interrupted by two or three weeks. With leukaemia you can’t wait a few weeks.”He added: “It became a question of should we stay, things deteriorating financially for the family – petrol into Aberdeen every day mounts up cost-wise and there was a risk if my treatment got postponed.”Mitchell’s German-born mother, Uschi, says they loved their life and home in Huntly, Aberdeenshire, and they miss their family and friends there – but the town and area have already changed significantly because of Brexit.“Even without Covid-19 the economy had started to contract. People and investors alike became increasingly cautious when it came to spending money,” she said.They also considered Ireland and Italy, but Uschi got a job in Germany. Fear over Brexit was “the main factor”, she added. “Where we were wasn’t brilliant for work so we thought we would not be able to sustain ourselves and Andreas’s diagnosis was a big scare, so Brexit was the big push in the end.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eae19eef7dedd2d3678d8510cfbf7f71f4477e1b/0_369_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=85732724c0308813704e4528df7d03f4","title":"remains of 10000 year old woolly mammoth pulled from siberian lake","story":"Rare find includes skin, tendon and excrement of what is thought to be an adult maleRussian scientists are poring over the uniquely well-preserved bones of a 10,000-year-old woolly mammoth after completing the operation to pull them from the bottom of a Siberian lake.Such finds are happening with increasing regularity in Siberia as climate change warms the Arctic at a faster pace than the rest of the world, thawing the ground in some areas long locked in permafrost.The woolly mammoth will probably be named Tadibe, after the family who discovered the adult animal, which is thought to have been a male between 15 and 20 years old, and and about 10ft (three metres) tall.Andrey Gusev from the Centre of Arctic Research, said the preservation of the animal was unique, with the lower spine still connected by tendons and skin, but that the retrieval operation was painstaking because the remaining bones were jumbled up.“We assumed that the bones were preserved in the anatomical order. But the first and the second days of our expedition showed that it was true only about the back part of the skeleton,” he said. “The rest of the bones were in such chaotic order that it was impossible to guess where they were.”Evgenia Khozyainova from the Shemanovsky museum in Salekhard, said: “We have one front and one hind foot well-preserved, with tendons, soft tissues and pieces of skin. Also we have sacrum with adjacent vertebrae, including the tail preserved with tendons and a big piece of skin.”Of particular interest is the excrement, or coprolite, because it will contain details of the animal’s diet, as well as pollen and other environmental clues.The cause of the mammoth’s death is not clear yet as no signs of injuries were found on the bones.Researchers have found mammoth fossils dating from up to 30,000 years ago in Russia.Scientists circulated images in December of a prehistoric puppy, thought to be 18,000 years old, that was found in the permafrost region of Russia’s Far East in 2018.Reuters contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9d46ce0dbd31da0d371e583b13d746380029ee4/1610_106_4109_2465/master/4109.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c4790c9274815764e7dc68e681b758e","title":"covid 19 does more testing always mean more cases podcast","story":"Since the beginning of the pandemic, ‘test, test, test’ has been the key message from epidemiologists, infectious disease specialists and healthcare professionals alike.

Her six-year-old daughter follows a dairy-free diet, and had a reaction to the packed lunchboxes her school sent out as replacement for free school meals. The boxes Corley received were often filled with unhealthy produce, leaving a single parent on universal credit with little choice but to feed her children what was inside or risk them going without.Corley describes the contents of a typical box as follows: “This is 10 days worth of lunches, and lunch is meant to be part of your five a day, so what do we have? Two apples and two oranges that is not a week’s worth of fruit for lunches. I don’t believe in junk food, but what have we got? Popcorn and crisps … Two little cakes … Yoghurts, six yoghurts. I think these are all full of sugar.”The needs of Corley and her children, and those of millions of families living on low incomes, were missing from Rishi Sunak’s summer statement, in which the chancellor announced the “eat out to help out” scheme that began on Monday and runs throughout August. What this policy either neglects or deliberately conceals is that, for many households, eating out in cafes and restaurants, heavily discounted or not, is a luxury that is simply unavailable to them. Corley and her family never eat out. “A treat to us is one of those supermarket meal deals, where you get a drink, snack and sandwich for £3,” she says.Indeed, there is a jarring contrast between the policy’s underpinning rhetoric – the appeal to do the right thing by spending money – and the reality for families in poverty who struggle to afford the essentials. For many of these families, life has become much harder since the pandemic hit the UK.Corley’s is one of those families and they are taking part in a new research project documenting their experiences in diaries. The aim of sharing their everyday realities of life on a low income during the pandemic is to try to ensure that policymakers include their perspectives on what needs to change, and why. This emerging evidence already shows that the financial struggle and costs of getting by on a low income with dependent children have worsened in recent months. Rising costs from being at home all day, every day, have not been offset by any additional support, such as an increase in the standard allowance for universal credit, and replacements to free school meals. These have benefited some – but not all. Roisin Murphy, a single parent of two young children, one of whom is disabled, described how lockdown had made things harder:“We spend so much more on electricity, food, gas, as we are at home most of the time. We used to have lunch or dinner at my mum’s after I got the children from school. Mum always picked up little things for us when she had done her shopping, like washing powder or sweets or toys. Now we can no longer visit.” Some of the parents in the project described how the act of asking for emergency help made them feel guilty and ashamed, as if their poverty made them a bad parent. Holly Thomas felt guilty when she couldn’t use some of the food she received in an emergency food parcel because it was out of date and mouldy.“I’m so very grateful for these boxes from charity – I feel guilty for using them but also grateful. I’m sad at having to bin some items. In the box were two tubs of sweating and stinky carrots. Of the bread, all were dated two days ago. I’m pretty good at making food last and use-by dates are subjective, depending on the product, alas these breads weren’t child-suitable: two were open, stale and smelt weird. One was rock solid – kids used it as a drum, it was so hard. The last was unopened and looked safe to use. I opened it to make sandwiches, and the smell of mould was sickening. I hated having to bin them. I know beggars can’t be choosers but four loaves of inedible bread was an emotional blow at the time.”It can only be described as perverse to have mothers, such as Thomas, facing the indignity of receiving inedible charitable food provision – itself a poor substitute for a failing social security system – while at the same time having a chancellor calling on us all to head to restaurants. The government is expected to spend £500m on the “eat out to help out” scheme. Yet, it had to be shamed into a U-turn by the footballer turned anti-poverty campaigner Marcus Rashford to fund a replacement to free school meals over the summer holidays, at a much more modest cost of £120m. Parents wrote in their diaries about how the future looked uncertain and frightening, the summer holidays only serving as a reminder of all the things that they would like to do with their children but could not. Low-cost and free activities that might usually help occupy children – such as trips to playgrounds, holiday clubs and informal get-togethers of groups of families – are severely restricted, and in some cases not possible at all because of the coronavirus.To properly support families living in poverty during and indeed after the pandemic, we need an adequately resourced and ambitious package of financial support aimed squarely at families living on a low income whose budgetary pressures and costs have increased. This would offset the additional costs of having children at home much more than usual and would ensure families can access decent food –that they can choose and purchase themselves, rather than relying on vouchers or charitable provision. But it is also necessary because the pandemic has starkly revealed the shortcomings of our social security system. Temporary measures, such as the increase to universal credit, are a tacit acceptance by government that benefits are not enough to live on, and should be converted into lasting and more ambitious change.If our government really listened to families on a low income they might think again before proclaiming that it is time to eat out to help out, without offering a parallel programme of support for families in poverty.Some names have been changed. • Ruth Patrick is working with families on the Covid Realities project, funded by the Nuffield Foundation.

This phonetic travesty refers to a unique achievement by Joe Root’s England last week. When they beat West Indies in the third Test at Old Trafford, they became the first side in Test history to win consecutive series after going 1-0 down. It reflects well on a number of things, including their resilience, their patience, their nerve - not to mention the decision, 17 years ago, of the Home Office to belatedly grant a work permit for Workington Town’s new coach, Ged Stokes.A successful response to adversity is never a bad thing, but that doesn’t mean it comes without a downside. Most would accept that a proper Test team shouldn’t have been going 1-0 down to these South Africa and West Indies sides in the first place. The Spin doesn’t want to be too harsh, because England’s Test team have made exciting progress since Chris Silverwood took over as coach. It no longer feels like a JFK moment when they score 400 and if they stop handicapping themselves they could become a serious team.England have been beaten in the opening Test of their past five series, excluding the one-off Test against Ireland, which equals their worst run. As a blueprint for world domination, and with two-Test series more popular than ever, going 1-0 down at the earliest opportunity is a plan even Baldrick would query.Under Root, England have won six series and lost four. If the first Test of those series had been drawn, they would have won seven and lost one. It has gone on too long to be dismissed as a statistical fluke. As well as losing five in a row, England have lost eight of the past 10 opening Tests.Teams of all shapes and competencies tend to develop a pattern of peaking at different times. The most obvious example is Pakistan. It is written in stone that if they are to win a global competition they must start the tournament with as many disgraceful defeats as possible.The two great Test teams of the modern era, West Indies from 1980-95 and Australia from 1995-2008, had different ways of extracting the will to play cricket from their opponents. The Windies often started series slowly, and then finish them emphatically. Australia, a team who relied on bluff as well as brilliance, tried to obliterate their opponents’ morale from the first ball of the first Test.Even England’s much-maligned 1990s team developed a pattern. They were very competitive in the first Test, especially when Australia weren’t involved, but the second and third Tests should have been sponsored by Reality Check Inc. England also have a fantastic historical record in the sixth Test of a series, which makes it doubly exasperating that they haven’t played one for 22 years and probably never will again.There’s no single reason for England’s opening-night woes in the past few years, but there are a few common threads. In most of the eight defeats they have not had their best team on the field. There are a variety of reasons for that: selection (not just Stuart Broad, twice, but also Jofra Archer in last year’s Ashes), injury and illness (Jimmy Anderson last summer, Ollie Pope in South Africa), paternity leave or a visit to Mbargo in Bristol.It also feels like England can take the first Test a bit lightly, as if their unconscious is whispering, “Why do today what you can do tomorrow?” Thinking of tomorrow is also a reason to pick an XI for the first Test with one eye on the future (OK, the next Ashes tour). But when they lose the first Test, it’s to hell with the future until the next series.This all ties in with the feeling that under Root England have been a bit easy come, easy go – or rather, given the pattern of their results, easy go, easy come. That’s also evident in a recurring failure to seize the moment in the first Test, when the whole series isn’t on the line. They were in several good positions during the first Ashes Tests of 2017-18 and 2019, particularly in the field, only to lose both matches heavily.(The alternative explanation – that they walked into Steven Peter Devereux Smith at his most terrifyingly focused, and that even the apocalypse wouldn’t have stopped him making a match-winning hundred – shouldn’t be discounted.) They also let South Africa off the hook on the first day of the series at Centurion last winter. England are a mentality change waiting to happen.It’s not just in team selection that England have been a bit too funky for their own good. They probably made the wrong decision at the toss by batting first against Pakistan in 2018 and West Indies this summer, and by bowling first against South Africa last year.No cursory investigation into the inadequacies of an England Test team would be complete without one of our oldest friends: the first-innings batting collapse. In all eight first-Test defeats since Root took over, wickets have fallen in a Proustian rush to leave England in trouble. The second day of the first Test is generally when they have placed themselves in intimate proximity to the eight ball.Batsmen rely on rhythm just as much as bowlers, so they are bound to be vulnerable at the start of a series. But Wednesday’s match against Pakistan should be different. During the third Test against West Indies last week, Stuart Broad said that because they were playing the same opposition on the same ground so soon after the second Test it felt like a continuation of that game rather than a new match.Though the opposition have changed, England should be ready to hit the ground running when they return to Old Trafford. Pakistan, by contrast, have all the disadvantages of playing the first Test of an overseas series, with extra lockdown rust. If England lose this week, they really do have a problem.• This is an extract from the ’s weekly cricket email, The Spin.

It slots under the higher-priced £669-and-up Pixel 4 series, replacing last year’s Pixel 3a and 3a XL with only one size of phone, taking the design of the 3a and expanding the screen to fill the front of the device.A 5G version is coming later in the year but for now the Pixel 4a is 4G only.The body is high-quality, soft-touch polycarbonate and feels surprisingly nice. The 5.8in FHD+ OLED screen looks great: it is bright, crisp enough and has reasonably slim bezels all the way around. There is a fairly large hole in the top left of the screen for the selfie camera and the display does not have the 90Hz refresh rate of some slightly more expensive competitors but it does have HDR certification for watching movies.The back of the device has a traditional fingerprint scanner that just works, and does so in all apps. Google’s face unlock on the Pixel 4 worked brilliantly for unlocking the phone but even nine months later, only a handful of third-party apps support it.The top features the lesser-spotted headphone socket. The bottom a universal USB-C socket for power. The phone has stereo speakers that are very good. There’s no wireless charging, nor official water-resistance rating.Google has been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic to a greater extent than other smartphone companies, which has delayed the release of the Pixel 4a by several months and means there is a long lead time between its announcement and open sale in October. It also means the phone will only available in black to start with.The Pixel 4a uses the upper-middle range Snapdragon 730G chip from Qualcomm, which is one of the last remaining new processors not to feature 5G and a significant step up from Snapdragon 670 used in the Pixel 3a last year. It comes in a single version with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.Day-to-day performance was really good, matching the sort of smooth operation you would expect of top-spec phones from the last few years. Switching between apps, loading images, unlocking the phone and other bits was snappy even games such as Real Racing 3 performed well.Battery life was also good for a relatively small and light phone. The Pixel 4a lasts 31 hours between charges, which is significantly longer than the larger Pixel 3a XL and iPhone SE (both 27 hours), consistently going from 7am on day one until 2pm on day two.That was after spending three hours on 4G, the rest on wifi. And with the always-on display active, the screen on for up to five hours for the usual deluge of email, messages and push notifications, browsing and using apps, five hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones and about 20 photos. Turning off the always-on display added about two hours of battery life.The Pixel 4a ships with Google’s version of Android 10 and buyers can expect a minimum of three years of operating system and security updates, which is good for a phone of this price but is still some way behind Apple’s five-year support for iPhones (including the £419 iPhone SE).The Pixel’s version of Android is slick and well-optimised, here matching that running on the Pixel 4 series from October last year. Generally speaking, it is attractive and simple, and works like most other versions of Android, with full adoption of the gesture controls, theme support and other additions made to standard Android 10.But on top are a few Google-exclusives, first introduced with the Pixel 4, that revolve around using artificial intelligence run locally on the phone, rather than on a remote Google server as used to be required.The new Google Assistant experience is most noticeable. It uses an advanced local voice-recognition system to dramatically accelerate the whole experience, allowing Assistant to understand and respond immediately, with no lag at all. You can rattle off commands at breakneck speed, from launching apps, finding things and performing tasks. It’s a night and day improvement and is better at preserving your privacy as the process is done locally, on your device.The Pixel 4a also has Google’s Now Playing system that recognises songs playing around you, and the impressive Google Recorder app that can transcribe speech in real time. The Live Caption system that transcribes videos in real time using on-device AI can now be used for voice and video calls, too.The Pixel 4a has Google’s excellent single-camera system. It lacks the second camera for optical zoom from the Pixel 4 but keeps most of its software features including Google’s industry-leading Night Sight for super low-light photography, an astrophotography mode to shoot the stars, live HDR+ allowing you to tweak the light and dark areas in real time, plus portrait mode for people and pets.It is arguably the best point-and-shoot camera you can get for under £600, producing crisp, well-balanced and highly detailed shots in most environments. But the Pixel 4a isn’t quite as versatile as some rivals of a similar price that come equipped with ultra-wide and zoom cameras as well. Video captured at up to 4K at 30 frames per second is pretty good for the price, too, although I often accidentally blocked the mic with my hand.The selfie camera is very good, capturing good images in most lighting conditions, but it struggles a little with fine detail when expanded to full-size.The Pixel 4a costs £349 and is only available in black to start with.It will be available to pre-order from 10 September and go on sale on 1 October.The Pixel 4a is Google’s best smartphone in years.It is small, light and feels great. It has an OLED screen that is colourful, crisp and big enough for most things. Performance is good, the battery lasts a solid 31 hours between charges and the camera is leagues better than the price may suggest. It even has a headphone socket, with is a true rarity in 2020.You get monthly security updates, at least three years of software updates and Google-exclusive features, some of which are genuinely impressive. The speed of the new Google Assistant is a game-changer but whether you actually want to routinely talk to your phone is another matter.It’s not perfect, of course. There is no 5G on offer (yet). The body is plastic and doesn’t feel as premium as metal and glass competitors, and there’s no water-resistance rating. The mid-range smartphone market is increasingly competitive, too, meaning the Pixel 4a faces stiff competition from some household names, including Apple’s £419 iPhone SE and the new OnePlus Nord, which has 5G, more cameras and a bigger, better screen for £30 more.But at £349 for a smaller, lighter phone that works really, really well from the actual maker of Android, the Google Pixel 4a is simply great.Pros: great camera, good screen, good software and update support, good battery life, headphone socket, relatively small, fairly inexpensiveCons: no 5G, only single camera, no wireless charging, no water resistance, no expandable storage This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Think again. Driving a hybrid vehicle is a practical way to reduce emissions while being economical and fuss-free, say expertsAs awareness of the climate crisis grows and urban pollution levels creep ever higher, we’re all starting to think more about our carbon footprints. For those who are considering buying a car, which one to go with requires careful thought and research.Should we stick with petrol or diesel, take the plunge to buy an electric vehicle or maybe opt for a hybrid? Of these options, there tends to be the most confusion around hybrids. There are a lot of myths about these vehicles, many of them based on the early, less sophisticated versions that entered the market about 20 years ago. But it’s worth busting through these concerns and getting to grips with what hybrids can offer, as for many of us they can be an excellent choice for greener, more economical and fun motoring.“We were early to market with hybrids back in the late 1990s with the Insight and then the sportier CR-Z,” says Phil Webb, deputy general manager automotive at Honda UK. “These were arguably ahead of their time and are now modern classics. Fast forward 20 years and, while hybrids have changed drastically, the concerns around owning and driving them have not.”Here are some of the most common misconceptions.Myth one: hybrid technology is complicated and difficult to understandThere are different types of hybrid cars, and hearing terms such as “mild”, “full” and “plug-in hybrid electric vehicle” (PHEV) bandied around can be confusing. But it’s quite straightforward. A hybrid car is one that uses two forms of energy to maximise efficiency and reduce emissions. Usually this means combining electrical energy contained in batteries with the combustion energy of petrol or diesel fuel.“Hybrid cars were developed to reduce CO2,” explains Nick Molden, CEO of Emissions Analytics, a global emissions testing specialist. “They do it via two means. Firstly, there’s regenerative braking. When a vehicle brakes there’s a lot of wasted energy. Hybrids capture this energy into the battery and it can then be used to power the vehicle. Secondly, hybrids help the engine work at optimal efficiency as much of the time as possible. Electric power is suited to lower-speed stop-start driving such as you might do in a city. And petrol and diesel engines are more suited to driving at higher, constant speeds – for example, during motorway driving. Hybrid technology means that the two parts work together in harmony, each doing what it’s best at.”“We have deliberately made our hybrids incredibly easy to drive,” says Webb. “Our new CR-V hybrid has three driving modes pure electric, hybrid and engine-only – but what makes it easy to drive is the fact that the car will select the most fuel-efficient way of powering the car, so the driver doesn’t have to.”Myth two: hybrids have to be plugged inSome hybrids are plug-ins, while others are not. Plug-in hybrids have batteries that can be charged from a power outlet and can run on electric power alone for between 30 and 40 miles, before needing the petrol or diesel engine to kick in. But hybrid technology is also available in cars such as the CR-V hybrid, which does not need to be plugged in. And with both types of hybrid, “range anxiety” isn’t something you need to worry about – if the electrical energy runs out, they will shift over to the petrol or diesel engine.Myth three: hybrids are a cop-out. If we care about climate change we should be driving electric carsIn an ideal world, more of us would be driving electric cars. They have zero tailpipe emissions, so in terms of reducing CO2 and combating climate change they’re an excellent choice. But the fact is that electric vehicles aren’t practical for many people – especially those who live in flats or terraced houses and don’t have access to a charging point, or anyone who does a lot of long-distance driving.Tim Anderson, head of transport at the Energy Saving Trust, says: “For motorists who don’t have access to charging points, hybrids can be a worthwhile stepping stone towards reducing their CO2 emissions. They are more energy-efficient than their petrol and diesel counterparts and are easy to buy, drive and live with.”Myth four: hybrids aren’t fun to driveMotoring journalist Tim Barnes-Clay doesn’t agree. “Early hybrids used to feel quite different from ‘regular’ cars, with a lack of connection with the driver’s input and the vehicle’s road behaviour. But now hybrids can be a joy to drive on any road, including motorways. For example, the Honda CR-V hybrid uses CVT automatic transmissions, giving a continuous flow of smooth power.”Myth five: hybrids aren’t very stylishWhen hybrids first came out about 20 years ago they did look quite quirky and different. “However, designers have responded to what consumers want and hybrids are now styled to look as attractive as any other car,” says Keith Adams, editor of car-buying website parkers.Myth six: hybrids are too expensive“Although hybrid cars cost a bit more than their petrol and diesel counterparts, their fuel economy means that savings can be made in running costs,” says Adams. And with minimal running costs and excellent reliability, hybrids are in demand on the secondhand market and their resale value tends to be strong.Misconceptions about hybrids mean they can be seen as the worst of both worlds – not as green as electric cars, and less stylish and enjoyable to drive than conventional petrol or diesel vehicles. But for many motorists, they are the opposite, offering a practical and accessible way to reduce emissions while also being economical and fuss-free."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/669fbbafa396bb6074314e01d874794028714c9d/734_0_2720_1632/master/2720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=818dfd80e23da5e1de22cc7d4dd296de","title":"english pubs likely to be spared new covid 19 restrictions no 10 says","story":"PM’s spokesman says focus will be on localised measures to restrict gatherings in homesEnglish pubs are likely to be spared any new restrictions on social contact to stem coronavirus outbreaks, with the focus instead falling on limiting gatherings in homes, Downing Street has indicated.Amid speculation about potential further curbs on freedoms if Covid-19 cases rise following the full return of pupils to English schools in September, officials have stressed that they hope to keep any lockdowns local and avoid further significant harm to the economy.No 10 also argues that closing pubs or other parts of the hospitality industry would not necessarily be effective, given the importance of transmission between households in local outbreaks, such as those which prompted emergency restrictions for millions of people in the north of England.A government source said the most likely next step if infections escalated would be more widespread restrictions on social contact rather than closing down specific industries.“It’s not a 1-2-3 process but the point is that it is based on specific information about what is happening. It suggests it’s household to household,” the source said. “In the north-west, the problem is households, not pubs. So you can only go to the pub with your household.”Speaking on Friday after Boris Johnson delayed some easing measures as infection rates increased, Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, said the country was “at the outer edge” of what could be reopened, and that if further rules were lifted, others would have to be tightened to compensate.Prof Graham Medley, who chairs the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) subgroup on pandemic modelling, said on Saturday that one option might be to close pubs when pupils return to school.Johnson’s spokesman, however, played down the idea and stressed the desire to avoid nationwide measures if possible.“Our approach is a localised one, where you would assess the situation on the ground and take whatever steps were required to slow the spread of the virus,” he said. “More broadly, we are committed to supporting the hospitality industry, which has had a very tough time. It employs more than 2 million people, predominantly young people, and it’s important that we continue to support it.”Asked what, if any, compensatory measures might need to be taken, he pointed to the measures introduced at the end of last week in the north of England, which barred people from different households from meeting indoors, and the subsequent declaration of a major incident in Greater Manchester.“Decisions will always be based on local evidence and scientific guidance,” he said. “We have in place a system now for localised lockdowns. You will see that in Greater Manchester, and in other areas, the steps that we have taken have been to restrict social contact, because that was what the experts considered was responsible for an increase in the prevalence of the virus.”The Covid-19 pandemic is currently unfolding in “one big wave” with no evidence that it follows seasonal variations common to influenza and other coronaviruses, such as the common cold, the\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbsphas warned.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics. Until now that had been what was expected from Covid-19.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.In June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that China had previously been able to lift. In the UK, the city of Leicester was unable to come out of lockdown because of the development of a new spike of coronavirus cases. Clusters also emerged in Melbourne, requiring a re-imposition of lockdown conditions.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.However Linda Bauld, professor of public health at the University of Edinburgh, says “‘Second wave’ isn’t a term that we would use at the current time, as the virus hasn’t gone away, it’s in our population, it has spread to 188 countries so far, and what we are seeing now is essentially localised spikes or a localised return of a large number of cases.”\u0026nbspThe overall threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.There will, however, still be a focus on other potential areas of spread, such as workplaces. Localised restrictions imposed on Leicester were connected to potential infections at garment factories.Some councils are believed to be concerned that not all business outbreaks are being reported quickly enough. Sandwell council in the West Midlands, which Public Health England has listed as an area of concern over rising case numbers, has urged firms to report any outbreaks promptly.No 10 is adamant to English schools will reopen fully after the summer. “You’ve heard from the prime minister on many occasions his absolute commitment to getting out children back into school in September,” the Downing Street spokesman said. “That’s vital for their education and their development. We are planning for all pupils in all year groups to return to school full time from the beginning of the autumn term.”The only exception could be “a very specific localised lockdown that might require a single school to close”, he said.The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, said on Monday that it was “totally unacceptable” that ministers had reportedly discussed the possibility of sealing off the capital if infections rose sharply there.Johnson’s spokesman said there were no plans to do so, but stressed that the idea of restricting travel into a badly affected area had already been outlined as a possible course of action.“If you look at the contain strategy, which we published just over two weeks ago, it sets out … the possibility of putting in place restrictions on travel if there’s an area that is particularly badly affected. One of the steps within that potentially includes closing down local transport networks. So it’s there, it’s contained in the document. It’s not a new thing.“But to be clear, it’s not something that is specific to London or anywhere else.”He also dismissed reports at the weekend that people over 50 might be asked to shield in the event of rising infections in the winter as inaccurate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c72ffc4e900b7655c3ec85b8de0c8a9988105aba/0_163_3027_1816/master/3027.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c286191fde390967cc581ea22e8e63e2","title":"a small but powerful signal mumbai instals female figures on traffic lights","story":"Campaigners in India say the move helps dispel the notion that only men should be out in publicMumbai has become the first city in India to introduce female figures on its traffic lights, a move welcomed by campaigners as a step towards greater inclusivity.Authorities are swapping the green and red male stick figures for female figures on more than 100 pedestrian crossings as part of a broader plan to make roads more pedestrian-friendly.Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner with Mumbai’s municipal corporation, said: “The signage reflects the character of the city ... that it believes in gender equality and promotes women’s empowerment. This is just the start.”Equality campaigners said the change may appear small, but was significant. In many Indian cities, women make up only a small proportion of the people on the streets.“If a generation of little girls grow up seeing women figures on the traffic signals, it sends a small but powerful signal that women belong in the public,” said social scientist Shilpa Phadke.“The presence of such symbolism in the public might undo the idea that the imagined person on the street is male ... this is symbolically valuable in the long run,” said Phadke, co-author of Why Loiter? Women and Risk on Mumbai Streets.India’s financial capital already runs women-only coaches on suburban trains and reserved seating on buses, and is widely regarded as one of the country’s safest cities for women.Women in India have to deal with multiple safety issues, from dimly lit lanes to crowded public transport, though cities and states have initiated steps to make public spaces more accessible in recent years.The country was rated as the most unsafe in the world in a 2018 Thomson Reuters Foundation survey.Delhi last year announced free public transport for women to boost their mobility, and several Indian states give out free bicycles to girls to ensure they do not drop out of schools for lack of safe or accessible public transport.

The drug has become an unapproved black market treatment for the disease, once universally thought to be fatal to cats.In a letter sent to the heads of four government agencies currently developing treatments and vaccines for Covid-19, the left-leaning Public Citizen group called on Gilead to work collaboratively to begin development of the drug.The group also accused Gilead of choosing to develop remdesivir, which is much further along in the clinical trial process than GS-441524, because it would remain under patent longer and therefore produce more profit.“It is sadly predictable that Big Pharma responds to a global pandemic by trying to bring to market only those drugs that maximize its profits,” said Dr Michael Abrams, a researcher with Public Citizen’s health research group and lead author of the letter.“What is alarming here is that federal scientists and Trump administration regulators appear to be willing partners with Gilead in decisions that run distinctly counter to the government’s primary imperative of advancing public health during this worldwide crisis,” said Abrams.Gilead specializes in antiviral treatments, and has drawn criticism in the past for its pricing policies. A patented hepatitis C cure costs $1,000 per pill or $84,000 per course in the United States. And the company’s HIV prevention medication Truvada, which could significantly reduce transmission, can cost as much as $20,000 a year in the US.But not all agree pricing alone is driving Gilead’s decisions. Derek Lowe is a drug discovery scientist and the author of In the Pipeline, a blog which covers early drug development. Lowe said remdesivir could be useful only for a relatively short period of time if a successful vaccine is developed, and that GS-441524 is years behind remdesivir.“Monoclonal antibodies and vaccines are, to my eyes (and not just mine) the answer to this pandemic,” said Lowe. As those treatments become available, molecule-based antivirals such as remdesivir and GS-441524, will become less valuable.Remdesivir was available for human use quickly because Gilead hoped to develop the drug to treat victims of Ebola. Although it failed as a treatment for that virus, remdesivir had “an established dosing and safety profile”, as National Institutes of Health researchers wrote.“That’s what’s driving Gilead’s decision making – they know that remdesivir is their bird-in-the-hand, and that pouring their (large but finite) resources into another compound to try to get it caught up could be a bad move,” said Lowe. “By the time they get it ready to launch, it’s possible that no one would care.”A spokesperson for Gilead said the decision to develop remdesivir had been taken because it had been shown to be “more effective” in certain key areas than GS-441524 and thus a better candidate for potentially treating Covid-19.“Reinforcing this decision was the ability to rapidly progress clinical trials with remdesivir, given the urgency of the global pandemic,” the spokesperson added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b41571c653e5acdf4cfca4c2b9a4e45f8f52c825/0_0_4433_2662/master/4433.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=574f06ea881c0bc7e9b7b7a7ae115fca","title":"kashmir curfew brought in as region marks one year since special status revoked","story":"Soldiers patrol Indian-controlled areas as protesters plan ‘black day’ to mark 5 AugustAuthorities have brought in a curfew in many parts of Indian-controlled Kashmir, one day ahead of the first anniversary of India’s controversial decision to revoke the disputed region’s special status.Shahid Iqbal Choudhary, a civil administrator, said the security lockdown was put in place in the region’s main city of Srinagar in view of information about protests planned by anti-India groups to mark 5 August as “black day.”Police and paramilitary soldiers drove through neighbourhoods and went to people’s homes warning them to stay indoors. Government forces erected steel barricades and laid razor wire across roads, bridges and intersections.The curfew will be enforced on Tuesday and Wednesday, Choudhary said in a government order.“A series of inputs have been received suggesting that separatist and Pakistan-sponsored groups are planning to observe August 5 as Black Day and violent action or protests are not ruled out,” he said.Last year on 5 August, India’s Hindu-nationalist government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi downgraded Jammu-Kashmir status and ided it into two federally governed territories. Since then, New Delhi has brought in a slew of new laws which locals say are aimed at shifting the demographics in the Muslim-majority region, many of whom want independence from India or unification with Pakistan.The status of Kashmir has been a key dispute between Pakistan and India since the two split in 1947 after the end of British colonial rule. They each control part of Kashmir and have fought two wars over their rival claims.Initially, the anti-India movement in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir was largely peaceful, but after a series of political blunders, broken promises and a crackdown on dissent, Kashmiris launched a full-blown armed revolt in 1989.After the 5 August decision, Indian authorities enforced an information blackout and a harsh security clampdown in Kashmir for months. Thousands of Kashmiri youth, pro-freedom leaders and politicians who have traditionally supported Indian rule were arrested. Hundreds of them are still incarcerated.As some of the restrictions were eased, India enforced another harsh lockdown in March to combat the spread of the coronavirus, deepening the social and economic crisis in the restive region.Human Rights Watch asked that India reverse its “abusive policies” in the region and said it was dismayed India persisted with “its repression of Kashmiri Muslims” despite the pandemic forcing the world to address discrimination and inequality.“Indian government claims that it was determined to improve Kashmiri lives ring hollow one year after the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir’s constitutional status,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, the global rights group’s South Asia director, in the statement made Tuesday. “The authorities instead have maintained stifling restraints on Kashmiris in violation of their basic rights.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39af064c310387d0e3f984665be9f3ff50ff7771/0_3_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=196a63eb7c0a2015c3a2362b305e6130","title":"tuesday briefing britons flee brexit by the thousands","story":"Record numbers emigrating to regain EU citizenship rights … tarnished ex-king to leave Spain … and the future of Extinction RebellionGood morning, Warren Murray bringing you the headlines this Tuesday morning.The withdrawal agreement signed in January enshrines residency, work and social rights of EU citizens in the UK and Britons in the bloc, but failed to guarantee the free movement rights of British migrants – restricting future employment and residency prospects in other member states.

Dozens of leading virus experts have complained that UK testing contracts have gone on ideological grounds to private sector companies rather than being based on expertise.

It cites “little or no evidence” that the commonly used drugs make any difference to quality of life, pain or psychological distress in people with long-term pain.

Questions over Egypt’s falling case numbers remain, reports our own Ruth Michaelson, while a group of celebrity cultural figures have called for the release of a young Egyptian filmmaker and activist incarcerated for “spreading false news,” about Covid-19 in Egyptian prisons.Over 200 filmmakers, artists and actors including Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, Dave Eggers, Danny Glover, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Thandie Newton and Anish Kapoor signed a letter published today demanding the Egyptian authorities free Sanaa Seif.Seif, aged 26, was snatched into an unmarked van by Egyptian security forces in late June when she and two family members went to report their assault outside Cairo’s infamous Tora prison complex. The family had previously staged a sit-in outside Tora to receive a letter from Seif’s incarcerated brother, the prominent activist Alaa Abd El-Fattah.Egypt’s public prosecution charged Seif with using her Facebook page to “disseminate false news and rumours about the deteriorating health conditions in the country and the spread of coronavirus in prisons,” as well as staging demonstrations to “pit public opinion against state institutions and forcing them to release some prisoners.”Egypt holds an estimated 60,000 political prisoners, while Human Rights Watch tracked increasing cases of Covid-19 inside overcrowded prison facilities and police stations, including Tora prison.Egypt has registered almost 95,000 cases of Covid-19, but has recently seen a drop in daily case numbers to rates similar to those witnessed in April. The government has repeatedly lifted restrictions on social activities to allow life to return to normal, and this week announced the gradual reopening of Coptic churches. Yet a recent investigation by Egypt’s only independent media outlet MadaMasr detailed how results obtained from a new swath of private drive-through testing centres across the country aren’t included in Egypt’s official case count.

Vietnam reported 10 new COVID-19 infections and two deaths on Tuesday, said the news agency, lifting its total cases to 652, with eight dead. The increase comes as the capital, Hanoi, said it was running short of the rapid testing kits being used to keep a new outbreak at bay.Targeted testing and strict quarantining had helped Vietnam contain earlier outbreaks, but it is battling a new cluster of infections after going more than three months without detecting any domestic transmission.The new outbreak has infected more than 200 people since July 25, the majority in the central city of Danang, but it has spread to at least eight other cities and provinces, including Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, where entertainment venues are closed and gatherings restricted to prevent infections.Danang and Buon Ma Thuot in the coffee-growing Central Highlands have been placed on lockdown. A government spokesman on Monday said Vietnam does not plan a nationwide lockdown.More than 88,000 people have returned to Hanoi from Danang since July 8, but only 70,689 were tested, the health ministry said. Only two of those were positive.The gap is due to a shortage of rapid testing kits used to screen thousands of residents at a time, according to state media.The health ministry said it would assign Hanoi medical institutions and hospitals to boost testing capacity.The rapid test kits, which can diagnose a blood sample in minutes but are prone to inaccuracies, are used to identify potentially positive cases which are then confirmed with the more accurate, swab-based Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test.Phan Quoc Viet, chairman of test kit manufacturer Viet A Corp, said he was not concerned about stocks.“Vietnam is not short,” Viet told Reuters. “We have enough for two million PCR tests and are willing to provide enough kits for the country to conduct a widespread testing programme”.Reuters is reporting that a second wave of the coronavirus epidemic is “highly likely” to hit France in the autumn or winter, according to the government’s top scientific body. The warning comes as authorities seek to contain an increase in new cases over the past two weeks.After strict lockdown measures pushed down infection rates, many European countries are now watching numbers creep back up, a consequence of easing curbs to try to limit economic damage and greater social mixing in the holiday season.“The situation is precarious and we could at any moment tip into a scenario that is less under control, like in Spain,” the French scientific committee said in a statement published by the health ministry.“It is highly likely that we will experience a second epidemic wave this autumn or winter,” it said, adding that if people failed to respect social distancing rules, it could not rule out a return of the epidemic as soon as this summer.The warning comes after the head of the German doctors’ union said the country was already contending with a second wave and risked squandering its early success by flouting social distancing rules.French authorities have already started to tighten public hygiene rules, with cities such as Lille and Nice ordering people to wear masks in busy pedestrian streets.France has reported 3,376 new confirmed Covid-19 cases over the last three days and the number of people being treated in ICUs for the disease has started to creep higher.President Emmanuel Macron, on holiday at in his summer residence of Bregançon on the Mediterranean coast, is expected to travel to the port city of Toulon later in the day to meet social workers looking after older people.AP has a erting and thought-provoking photo article on face masks. From an elderly man playing drums on the street in Tel Aviv, Isreal, to a showgirl wearing a rather dashing mask at the reopening of Bally’s Las Vegas hotel and casino, to a terrifyingly diamanted-up Trump supporter seamlessly incorporating her mask into the rest of her eye-catching look, the photos capture an element of life that has quickly become almost universal amid the pandemic.As the article says, some of those wearing masks adapted quickly. Others took time to accept them as necessary – and yet more question whether they really are needed, despite medical evidence that they help prevent the coronavirus from spreading. All are wondering how much longer they’ll remain nearly ubiquitous in public life.The Yonhap News Agency is reporting that two unlawful defection attempts were reported at a government-designated coronavirus quarantine facility for foreigners in Incheon, west of Seoul, in less than 20 days. The escapes happened despite authorities’ repeated pledges to heighten supervision of arrivals from abroad.According to police, a Vietnamese national escaped from an Incheon hotel designated by the health ministry as a temporary foreign quarantine accommodation around 4am Monday before being detained in Seoul eight hours later.The 39-year-old Vietnamese man, who entered the hotel on 23 July to self-quarantine for two weeks under Korean law, was accused of leaving the facility without permission by using a descending life line from his room on the fifth floor. The man was caught using the emergency fire device on a surveillance camera but monitoring staff failed to detect his escape, police said.On 21 July, an American man in his 20s was detained by police after escaping from the same hotel and is now awaiting deportation. The man was found to have left the facility through an unmonitored emergency exit and bought cigarettes at a convenience store about 100 metres away.Following the repeated escape attempts, Incheon police have increased the number of patrol officers tasked with monitoring the hotel by six to 33, who are on duty 24 hours a day in three shifts.Under the quarantine measures that took effect in early April, all entrants from overseas – both Koreans and foreigners – are obliged to self-quarantine at their residences or government-designated facilities for 14 days. Violators of the self-quarantine rules are fined and deported.In late July, three Vietnamese nationals were arrested after escaping from a Covid-19 quarantine facility in Gimpo, west of Seoul.We’re reporting that builders in the Australia could lose $450m daily under Melbourne stage 4 Covid-19 lockdown.Work levels from big construction sites to trade businesses set to be pummelled amid predictions new curbs will ‘knock wind out of’ stateVictorian builders say they will take a hit to revenue totalling up to $456m a day from sweeping new restrictions on construction in the state, forcing some companies to close their doors entirely.Under tough restrictions announced on Monday that are designed to slow the spread of the state’s coronavirus outbreak, the number of workers on large building sites such as apartment complexes and office towers is to be reduced to a quarter of the normal number.But some builders are concerned that under the new rules they will not be able to safely perform some labour-intensive tasks, such as pouring concrete slabs.There are also concerns that another rule that restricts people to working on one site for the six-week duration of the clampdown will make it impossible for tradespeople to carry on their businesses.“Many businesses will have to consider whether it’s feasible to work under the conditions as they are written,” the chief executive of Master Builders Victoria, Rebecca Casson, said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ddf921c9721d072a6ab9af710c329146da1d3a4/0_313_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54d66773a91e52999d1ec3b66e7fe1b8","title":"uk coronavirus live news latest updates covid 19 test trace","story":"Total of 8,891 deaths in England and Wales in week to 24 July, reports ONS Researchers warn more testing is needed ahead of schools reopeningThe UK government must urgently consider additional support for those on parental leave during the coronavirus pandemic before it is too late, MPs have said.Labour MP Catherine McKinnell, chairwoman of the petitions committee, has written to the business minister Paul Scully, saying the government must understand the urgency of the issue and “act immediately” before more parents have to give up their jobs.A report published by the committee last month recommended that the government should publish new guidance making it clear that pregnant women have a right to be suspended on full pay if they cannot work safely.Other suggestions included changing the way Statutory Maternity Pay is calculated to disregard periods of unpaid leave or Statutory Sick Pay where pregnant women were put on these incorrectly.The committee argued that, as the government was able to amend the Statutory Maternity Pay calculations to disregard the lower income of periods on furlough, it should also do so for women whose incomes have fallen through no fault of their own because their employers have failed to follow the guidance on how pregnant women should be treated.The report was prompted after more than 226,000 people signed an e-petition calling for the government to extend maternity leave by three months with pay in light of Covid-19, with thousands raising concerns about the dangerous impact the pandemic is having on their children’s development and their own mental health.But the government said a response to the report would not be possible before the House rose for summer recess on 22July due to the need for careful consideration of recommendations.In the letter on behalf of the committee, published on Tuesday, McKinnell said parents are being profoundly affected by coronavirus now and “many simple cannot wait until the autumn” for action from the government.I am extremely disappointed the government hasn’t recognised the urgency of this issue and at least responded in part to our report on the impact of Covid-19 on maternity and parental leave before the summer recess. This is particularly so given the prime minister’s recent personal commitment to review our report.Parents coming to the end of their leave are faced with a dreadful dilemma of having to prepare to return to work while they try to ensure that their child’s social and developmental needs are being met, at a time when finding suitable childcare is nearly impossible.Our investigation found some parents have even had to give up their jobs because there has been no financially viable way to extend their leave. This is having a profound impact on the mental health and wellbeing of families.New parents need clarity now on what support the government will provide for them in the midst of this pandemic - this can’t wait until the autumn.I implore the government to act on as many of our recommendations as possible before it’s too late, and have asked the government to act immediately on several recommendations in particular that do not even require a change of policy.Tui has extended the cancellation of its holidays to Portugal for UK customers until at least the end of next week.The UK’s largest tour operator said it will “continue to review its holiday programme in line with UK Government advice”.The Government has advised against non-essential travel to mainland Portugal since March 17 due to the coronavirus pandemic.Tui has already announced that its holidays to mainland Spain for UK tourists are cancelled until August 17, while its programmes in Spain’s Balearic Islands and Canary Islands are on hold until August 10.This is due to the Government’s decision to reintroduce the 14-day self-isolation requirement for people arriving from Spain and advise against non-essential travel to the country.More than 50 billion of loans to businesses hit by Covid-19 have been approved so far, the Treasury said. This includes, up to August 2, 33.34 billion in bounceback loans for 1,135,575 businesses.The Government, which is guaranteeing the vast majority of the loans should they not be repaid, added that 13.08 billion has been endorsed through the coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS) and 3.27 billion through the coronavirus large business interruption loan scheme (CLBILS) to larger firms.The local authority with the highest infection rate in England has launched its own contact-tracing system to plug holes in the £10bn national scheme described by Boris Johnson as “world-beating”.Blackburn with Darwen council, in Lancashire, set up its own virus-hunting team after the national system failed to reach hundreds of its most vulnerable residents.Dominic Harrison, the council’s director of public health, said the government programme was “simply not tracing enough cases and contacts fast enough”.The move reflects growing frustration among local health officials with the national test-and-trace system, which was launched in May as a central plank of the strategy to ease England out of lockdown. The NHS system, which is run by the former TalkTalk executive Dido Harding, involves more than 20,000 contact tracers employed by private firms such as Serco and Sitel.In Blackburn with Darwen, where the infection rate is more than 10 times England’s average, dozens of staff have been seconded from other departments to contact residents who could not be reached by the national system.All but three regions of England had deaths below the five-year average in the week ending July 24, the ONS said.There were a total of 8,891 deaths registered in England and Wales in the week to 24 July, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), 161 fewer than the five-year average of 9,052, PA reports.This is the sixth week in a row that deaths have been below the five-year average.Of the deaths registered in the week to July 24, 217 mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate – the lowest number of deaths involving Covid-19 since the week ending 20 March, when there was 103 deaths.  Figures published on Tuesday by the ONS show that 51,596 deaths involving Covid-19 had occurred in England and Wales up to 24 July, and had been registered by August 1.Figures published last week by the National Records for Scotland showed that 4,201 deaths involving Covid-19 had been registered in Scotland up to 26 July, while 854 deaths had occurred in Northern Ireland up to 24 July (and had been registered up to July 29) according to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency.Together, these figures mean that so far 56,651 deaths have been registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, including suspected cases.Dr Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths, senior research fellow and lecturer in mathematical modelling at the Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, UCL warned if Test and Trace is “not done effectively or adequately, then there is a risk of an occurrence of a second wave later this year”.Using the information that we have to date and in the mathematical study that we are talking about, we have fitted the model to data between 21 January this year and 16 June inclusive.We predict ... that under the scenarios, that under different Test and Trace scenarios, we ... are able to avoid a second wave if we test sufficiently, (a)sufficient number of people with symptoms and trace their contacts sufficiently, but if this is not done effectively or adequately, then there is a risk of an occurrence of a second wave later this year and peaking in December for the scenario of full opening of schools (in) society.Dr David Nabarro, the WHO’s special envoy on Covid-19, had echoed Panovska-Griffiths’ warning about Test and Trace.This virus is capable of surging back really quickly and is actually doing so in most countries where there’s been success at getting it under control and, as it surges back, the way you stop outbreaks developing is through having well-functioning contact tracing linked to testing, with isolation of people who’ve got symptoms or who’ve been in contact.If we can do that, and do it well, then the surges are kept really small, they’re dealt with quickly and life can go on.If, on the other hand, this testing and tracing and isolation just is not done properly, then you get very bad surges occurring and this will lead to economic challenges.The company is to launch a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) – an insolvency process which allows it to exit stores and cut rents – that could result in the closure of up to 70 of its 449 UK restaurants.Pizza Express said the decision to close restaurants was a difficult one but “against the current unprecedented backdrop, Pizza Express believes reducing the size of its estate will help it to protect 9,000 jobs”.The CVA is linked to a debt restructuring agreed with the company’s bondholders that will slash its debt burden from £735m to £319m.The news comes after 2,600 staff were told on Monday that they faced losing their job after the fitness and gym firm DW Sports collapsed into administration and the tour operator Hays Travel announced job cuts, blaming the UK government’s policy on travel to Spain.To find out more, head to our business liveblog. Former prime minister Tony Blair said a mass testing regime, which includes people who are not displaying coronavirus symptoms, is essential to avoid the need for another lockdown.From the very beginning, mass testing has been the only thing that gets you through this, avoids the severity of the very blunt instrument of lockdown and gets you to a place where you can more or less get your economy moving whilst containing the disease.EasyJet has said it is operating more flights than previously planned due to demand exceeding expectations.In the three months to the end of June, the budget carrier made just 7 million in revenue after the company’s fleet was grounded from 30 March because of the coronavirus pandemic.It started flying again in the middle of June and carried 117,000 passengers in the 132,000 seats it had available in the last two weeks of the quarter, easyJet said.Local government minister Simon Clarke has defended the government’s test and trace system after a group of researchers warned authorities would need to boost capacity or risk a second-wave of coronavirus after schools open. It’s obviously vital that we always continue to keep up the progress that we’re making with test and trace, which is a massive national undertaking and it is working. 184,000 people, so far, have been contacted by the programme who have tested positive or their contacts. And those people have all been allowed to self-isolate, be removed from the community at a time where they could be at risk of spreading the virus and that’s obviously a massive success. One thing is clear, schools are going to reopen in full in autumn, that is not up for debate. Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the NAHT school leaders’ union, said the research showed there many factors to preventing a worsening Covid-19 outbreak, most of which were entirely outside a school’s control.The success of September’s return to school rests as much on what happens outside the school gates as within. The government needs to ensure that everyone knows what actions they should be taking to keep everyone safe – we’re all going to need to work together to be successful.A group of Britain’s leading virus experts say mistakes are being made in the handling of the Covid pandemic, with testing contracts awarded on apparently ideological grounds to private sector companies rather than based on expertise.In a letter to England’s chief medical officer and the chief scientific adviser, nearly 70 clinical virologists say they have been sidelined by the government and excluded from discussions on how to respond to the pandemic.New 90-minute tests announced with fanfare by ministers on Monday were the latest example of how virologists were being bypassed, they say. They have been using rapid tests such as these already – but say they have no knowledge of or information on the DnaNudge or LamPORE tests that the government is contracting to buy.The letter comes amidst a warning by another group of researchers that the government has just one month to significantly boost its test-and-trace systems or risk a “second wave” of coronavirus after schools reopen.Nicola Davis and Sally Weale report:Against a backdrop of rising Covid infection rates in some areas and the introduction of local restrictions, the government has reiterated its determination to reopen schools in England to all pupils in all year groups in September.But researchers who modelled a range of scenarios for the reopening of schools as part of a wider easing of lockdown said there would need to be a rapid improvement to the test-trace-isolate system to avoid a resurgence of the disease.Labour and teaching unions, responding to the latest research, called for a more robust test-and-trace system. The shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said schools were making great efforts to welcome pupils back safely, but couldn’t do it on their own. “The government can’t walk away from its responsibilities,” she said. “Ministers must rapidly improve the test-and-trace system before pupils go back to class in September.”I’ll be on the liveblog for most of this morning.

Photograph: Colin KeeganThe Cabinet will on Tuesday consider proposals to reduce the number of countries to which people are permitted to travel without having to restrict their movements upon their return. Ministers will discuss proposals to shorten the travel “green list” alongside other measures to tighten restrictions on those arriving into Ireland from Covid-19 hotspots.It is understood that Malta and Cyprus may be removed from the green list.Senior Cabinet figures have also warned they are “not optimistic” about pubs reopening next week.The Cabinet will discuss recommendations on the roadmap to reopening from the National Public Health Emergency Team as well as proposals to tighten up travel restrictions.It is understood the option of departure Covid tests will form part of the discussion whereby a passenger would have to take a test before they arrive in Ireland.Government sources said that while the focus remained on ensuring that schools could reopen at the end of the month, it was unlikely there would be any major change in international travel policy until September when the schools return.Hotspot traffic“We need to be realistic about international travel. You can’t cut off business, travel, and people seeing their partners and loved ones for a year or years,” a source said ahead of the Cabinet meeting.The Government is likely instead to look at ways to reduce risk when it comes to travel within Europe with tighter restrictions when it comes to travel to and from hotspots.The Department of Transport was asked by the Cabinet a fortnight ago to investigate the efficacy and potential of a system which would see passengers having to undergo Covid tests prior to their departure for Ireland.It was envisaged the test would be taken within 24-72 hours prior to travel and proof of a negative test result would be presented to Irish immigration officials on arrival.Under such a system, the cost of the test would be borne by the traveller rather than the State.It was also envisaged that, under such a process, intending passengers who were found to be positive for Covid-19 would not undertake their planned journey. This would avoid the necessity to test all other passengers in the event of one traveller being found to be Covid-19 positive after the journey was made.HSE fundingMeanwhile, as Ministers prepare to consider the recent increase in Covid-19 cases in Ireland, doctors have warned of a “gaping hole” over funding at the heart of the new Health Service Executive plan to recommence health services which was shut down due to the Covid-19 pandemic several months ago.The Irish Hospital Consultants’ Association (IHCA) said on Monday it had raised concerns with Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly at a meeting in recent days over the HSE plan for a safe return to services published in late July.The Department of Health said in response: “The HSE receives significant funding from the State, and additional funding has been provided to the HSE this year to support its response to the Covid-19 crisis. Funding for the HSE will be kept under review as the provision of non-Covid services resumes.”Meanwhile, the latest figures show there have been no further deaths related to Covid-19 in the State but 46 new cases are confirmed.This means the death toll from the virus remains at 1,763 while the total number of cases in the State rises to 26,208.The five-day average is 53.4, a figure boosted by the 85 cases reported on Thursday.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Nobel Laureate\u0026rsquos remains to be brought to St Eugene\u0026rsquos Cathedral in Derry on TuesdayGarda\u0026iacute appeal for witnesses to separate and unrelated fatal crash on same road last weekPatrycja Wyrebek (20) was found dead at her home in Drumalane Park in NewryBackbench TD accused public servants of \u0026lsquolying on couch\u0026rsquo while binging on box setsMigrant workers and local students are helping the sector through labour shortageRabbit haemorrhagic disease means hare-coursing licences likely to stay suspendedKerry native lauds commitment of one social worker, mother\u0026rsquos love and youth workers\u0026lsquoHe taught us that it is better to live for Ireland than to die for Ireland,\u0026rsquo says EastwoodResearchers claim absence of consistent benefit and that evidence has been ignoredMary Seery Kearney was \u0026lsquophysically sick\u0026rsquo after reading physical and sexual threats onlineGuidelines advise RSA board members to treat negative commenters like \u0026lsquoan angry mob\u0026rsquoPubs unlikely to reopen amid 46 new cases and talk of pre-departure tests for visitorsCorruption and terror are key obstacles to progress in the country for Irish Coast Guard chiefNot \u0026lsquotolerable\u0026rsquo some schools refuse to set up specific classes despite demand from parentsFormer SDLP leader was awarded Nobel Peace Prize for his role in Northern IrelandHume \u0026lsquocommitted to pursuing objectives by exclusively peaceful and democratic means\u0026rsquoUnion president calls for elimination of two-tier structure ahead of schools reopeningNo deaths are reported on Monday as Glynn calls for collective \u0026lsquoencouragement\u0026rsquoBernard Geasley (40) had been fishing with friends at Ballincollig on Sunday eveningStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4321023.1596491864!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"charities to be able to apply for 6m raised in rt%C3%A9 does comic relief","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tComedian Deirdre O’Kane, a member of the Comic Relief in Ireland steering group, said it was a ‘key step for the project and brings us closer again to delivering help to where it’s needed’.

Photograph: Andrew MilliganPA WireLongford-born journalist Peter Geoghegan was sitting in a train carriage in Newcastle just before the Brexit referendum in 2016 when a quest began to unravel a mystery about the Democratic Unionist Party’s role in winning it.Flicking through a “well-thumbed copy” of the  newspaper, Geoghegan, who works now in Glasgow and London, saw the free newspaper’s front page “wraparound” advertisement.In it, British voters were urged to “Take back control”, the slogan of the official Vote Leave campaign,” Geoghegan recalls in his new book, Democracy for Sale, which is published by Head of Zeus on Thursday.“I turned the paper over. An imprint on the back said that the advert had been ‘paid for by the Democratic Unionist Party’,” says Geoghegan, a journalist with opendemocracy.net.“This was very curious. Since its foundation in 1971, the Democratic Unionist Party had never run a single candidate outside Northern Ireland, ” he writes.It was a little epiphany that ultimately led him down a number of other tracks and has resulted in the book.It is filled with the likes Steve Bannon, Donald Trump, Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and a former head of Saudi Arabian intelligence, Prince Nawwaf bin Abdul Aziz al Saud.Right there, too, is the DUP, which spent £435,000 “on a massive ad campaign promoting Brexit in England. I knew that election spending in the UK is tightly capped.”“I also knew, having worked as a reporter in Belfast, that political donations to Northern Irish parties were kept secret under anachronistic local laws. Perhaps this was a way around campaign limits?”So, would he solve the mystery?Geoghegan contends in Democracy for Sale that the money was channelled to the DUP through the official Vote Leave campaign because Vote Leave had almost used up its permitted spending of £7 million.Vote Leave and the DUP have denied the claim.Uncommunicative groupOther organisations on both sides of the campaign were allowed additional spending of up to £700,000. The author recounts how he discovered that an uncommunicative organisation called the Constitutional Research Council (CRC) donated £435,000 to the DUP to support the Leave crusade.To prop up his Vote Leave-DUP connection conviction, Geoghegan writes, “Two months before the referendum, Matthew Elliott, Vote Leave’s chief executive, wrote in an email to senior staff: ‘The DUP also have a £700k spending limit, which can be spent nationwide!’ ”“At that stage the DUP had yet to register as a referendum participant,” Geoghegan writes. “It only did so in late May. When the CRC started giving money to the DUP, Vote Leave had almost completely exhausted its spending allowance.”Geoghegan writes how the DUP’s Brexit “spending spree began on June 9th, exactly two weeks before the vote, when the DUP bought £100,000 worth of placards, bags, window stickers, T-shirts and badges from a small branding agency called Soopa Doopa”.This company was based in the Cambridgeshire cathedral town of Ely. The location and the company was a “surprising choice” for the DUP, thought Geoghegan. The fact that it published more than £800,000 of material for various Leave-supporting groups reinforced his belief that this was part of the alleged Vote Leave-DUP nexus.Two days before polls opened, Geoghegan writes, the CRC donated a further £334,993 to the DUP, much of which was spent on the wraparound ad in the  – a paper that does not circulate in Northern Ireland.He also says the DUP spent £32,000 on digital advertising through a Canadian company called AggregateIQ (AIQ) which had “bought millions of pounds worth of Facebook ads on behalf of a suite of pro-Brexit campaigns clustered around Vote Leave”.The Westminster “fake news” inquiry that began in 2017 and concluded in 2019 heard that AIQ had links with Cambridge Analytica, the political consulting firm founded by US billionaire Robert Mercer and US president Donald Trump’s former chief strategist Steve Bannon, although this has been denied by AIQ co-founder Zack Massingham.Cambridge Analytica got in serious trouble over allegedly misappropriating digital information, including acquiring the personal data of tens of millions of Facebook users.Front organisationGeoghegan, following the money trail, writes that “according to Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Chris Wylie, the DUP were simply a front organisation to allow Vote Leave to go beyond spending limits imposed by election laws” – again a charge that Vote Leave and the DUP strongly deny.Geoghegan explores how the only publicly known person associated with the CRC – the group that gave the £435,000 to the DUP – is Scottish businessman Richard Cook, a Conservative Party activist and Glasgow Rangers supporter.He is depicted as a colourful figure, who in 2013 jointly founded a company called Five Star Investments with Prince Nawwaf bin Abdul Aziz al Saud, a former director general of the Saudi intelligence agency who died in 2015. Cook held 5 per cent of the shares, the prince 75 per cent, and a third man, Danish national Peter Haestrup, held the other 20 per cent.Haestrup was allegedly linked to an Indian gun-running case known as the Purulia Arms Drop. Haestrup told Geoghegan he was never charged, had a “100 per cent clean record” and had done nothing wrong. He also explained how the wealth management business did not get off the ground and was dissolved in 2014 after “a lot of good dinners”.Despite these intriguing connections, Geoghegan portrays Cook as a man who would not have £435,000 to easily hand over to the DUP. He is convinced the CRC money came from other sources. Former Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy told Geoghegan that Cook, his long-time political adversary in East Renfrewshire, was “a bizarrely unlikely middle-man for this sort of money”.In addition to the £435,000, the author writes about how the CRC made two further contributions to the DUP after the Brexit referendum, totalling more than £13,000 – the DUP very generally and impenetrably saying it had used the money to “further the cause of unionism at home and abroad”.Geoghegan writes that Cook refused to reveal the source of the cash and said that, although he had administered the massive DUP donation, he had never received any money from his involvement in the CRC. “I just run a small consultancy company, doing some waste energy stuff internationally,” he said.Elusive truthGeoghegan does a lot of mining to find the other CRC backers but, as he admits, the gold seam proves elusive, his work not helped by electoral law in Northern Ireland or the DUP’s refusal to answer questions.Under previous electoral legislation in the North, political donors during the Troubles did not have to disclose their names or the size of their contributions because doing so could endanger their lives.In July 2017 that changed when then northern secretary James Brokenshire decided that life had moved on and donation details could be published.It could have been the moment that changed everything. However, it was not to be. Brokenshire could have backdated that legislation to January 2014, but decided not to.This led to allegations that he had done a “side deal” with the DUP – a charge bolstered by the fact that this was at a time when the DUP had signed up to a £1.5 billion confidence and supply deal to keep then UK prime minister Theresa May’s Tory government in power.It prompted former head of the North’s Electoral Commission Seamus Magee to deduce: “The deal on party donations and loans must be part of the DUPConservative deal. No other explanation.”This was denied at the time by DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson.Geoghegan, still chasing, writes how, in mid December 2017, 17 MPs met in a Westminster committee room to consider a legal order that would bring donor transparency to Northern Ireland.During a “truncated and bad-tempered” debate, DUP MPs Sammy Wilson and Ian Paisley, who were observers, insisted that their party had been wholly transparent about the £435,000 donation.Saying that the failure to backdate the legislation “stinks”, Labour MP Ben Bradshaw added: “The only conclusion that any reasonable person can draw is that the DUP was used, with its knowledge, by the CRC to funnel money to the Leave campaign in a way that to this day keeps the source of that money secret. By refusing to make this provision retrospective, the government are effectively complicit in covering that up.”In his book Geoghegan addresses many fascinating issues in relation to “dark money”, Brexit and political funding but in the end admits his investigation into the DUP and CRC does did not answer the big question.The wall of silence could not be penetrated. He concedes, “Just how much control the DUP had over its record donation and how it was spent remains unclear. And who was behind the money is still a mystery.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA Wire.The family of John Hume have asked people to light a candle for peace in memory of the Nobel Laureate who died on Monday.Mr Hume, who was 83, died on Monday morning in a Derry nursing home following a long period of illness. He is survived by his wife, Pat, and children, Terese, Áine, Aidan, John and Mo, his brothers and sisters and grandchildren.As preparations continue for his funeral in Derry on Wednesday the family requested some changes to the arrangements for the reception of his remains at St Eugene’s Cathedral in Derry on Tuesday.At the request of the family it was agreed that rather than bring Mr Hume’s remains from his home near Moville in Co Donegal to St Eugene’s Cathedral for 5pm on Tuesday, as originally planned, that the cortège would leave Moville at 7.30 pm and arrive at the cathedral sometime after 8.30 pm.And instead of people turning out at their homes as the funeral passed by they urged mourners “to light a candle for peace at 9pm in their doors or at their home”.This request was issued because Mr Hume’s wife Pat and family did not want to create dangers of people contracting coronavirus.On Monday night Father Paul Farren, administrator of St Eugene’s Cathedral in Derry met with the Hume family in preparation for Wednesday`s funeral Mass.“Pat and her family are very grateful for the outpouring of love and support following the death of their beloved John,” he said.He added, “The family are anxious that a public gathering for John’s funeral might inadvertently put someone’s health at risk in the context of the current Covid-19 pandemic, and are asking that people express their grief by staying at home and joining with the Hume family in a ‘Celebration of Light for Peace’.”Books of condolences have been opened across the country, including in Derry, Dublin, Belfast, Cork and Kilkenny.Throughout Monday tributes poured in from current and former Irish and British and other leaders such as Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Bertie Ahern, Tony Blair, Boris Johnson, former US president Bill Clinton, President Michael D Higgins and former president Mary McAleese.Members of the Ad Hoc Committee to Protect the Good Friday Agreement - a group made up of 40 well-known Irish-American politicians and business leaders - also released a statement on Tuesday, mant of them remembering their time working with him during his quest to secure American support for the peace process.Ted Smyth, former Irish diplomat and President of the Advisory Board at Glucksman Ireland House NYU, said:‘”You cannot eat a flag.” As early as 1964, John Hume in the  defined our challenge on the island of Ireland as reconciling two different loyalties by peaceful means.... John secured essential Irish American and US Government support for equal rights for nationalists and unionists. There would have been no peace without America and that is why we still need America to protect his legacy and the Good Friday Agreement.”Meanwhile the former US envoy to Northern Ireland and chair of the peace talks Gerge Mitchell said John Hume designed the template for negotiations that led to the Belfast Agreement.The US Senator described Hume as a “visionary” who could “look into the future and see the circumstances under which this could be brought to a successful conclusion, which was very hard to do given the tremendous amount of violence and hostility and fear that existed at the time.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4321021.1596494263!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"somalis are the irish of africa irish man helps rebuild somalia s rule of law","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish Coast Guard director and head of mission for EUCap in Somalia Chris Reynolds (right) speaking with officials in Mogadishu earlier this year ahead of the Covid-19 outbreak.When Irish Coast Guard director Chris Reynolds goes about his business, he is at all times accompanied by at least two armoured vehicles and a small platoon of armed bodyguards.These are not the typical transport arrangements for Coast Guard officials. But Reynolds’ current role is anything but typical.Since September 2019, the Dublin man has served as Head of Mission for EUCap, the EU’s mission to rebuild the rule of law in Somalia, with particular focus on building up a maritime policing capacity.“The risk here is so high. We take it very, very seriously,” said Reynolds, speaking from EUCap’s compound in the “Green Zone” – Mogadishu International Airport.The compound is protected by a line of Somali troops, a line of African Union troops and internally by a private security company. Even then, it is still regularly attacked with mortars by al-Shabaab, a terrorist group allied to al-Qaeda.“When we go outside, we go as a convoy. We use local security at front and behind and we have at least two armoured vehicles with our own armoured people inside. They could take a couple of rounds but a big explosion would be different. We don’t get out of the vehicles until inside another compound.”Reynolds, who was awarded the EU’s military support medal earlier this month, laughs when asked whether his family joined him in Mogadishu after he was seconded from the Irish Coast Guard.“Oh God no. You couldn’t bring your family.”The Terenure man is one of five Irish people on the EUCap mission and the first Irish head of an EU civilian capacity-building operation.Being Irish has its advantages in building relationships in the war-torn country.“It can open a lot of doors and make people relaxed. Ireland has a special place when it comes to working in places like Africa.‘Trouble with our neighbours’“The Somalis are the Irish of Africa,” he continues, recalling a quote from the 19th-century explorer Richard Burton. “Surrounded by beautiful waters, a history of famine, a history of migration. And we always have trouble with our neighbours.”His past experience as an officer in the Irish Naval Service has also helped and he would welcome more Defence Forces members on his 111-strong team.“It would be fantastic to get a Navy guy here. The Irish Navy is absolutely ideally suited. They do a lot of Coast Guard functions like fisheries protection, drug interdiction, security and safety. And they are extremely well trained.“I recognise they have recruiting problems at the moment but maybe with Simon Coveney as Minister for Defence as well as Foreign Affairs, you never know.”When Irish people think of Somalia, if they think of it at all, it is most likely piracy that comes to mind. Indeed, the main aim of EUCap’s predecessor mission Nestor was the suppression of the piracy which has plagued the horn of Africa in recent decades.Today, according to Reynolds,“piracy is well suppressed”. This was achieved by giving Somalis reasons not to tolerate it. This includes building up ports, the fishing industry and the rule of law.“You don’t chase pirates, you chase politicians,” he says.Much of this is mundane-sounding work, like helping to pass maritime legislation and establish maritime courts.Reynolds says his most difficult task is the establishment of a“blue water” coast guard to patrol Somalia’s resource-rich waters. Other jobs include setting up a“brown water” policing capability to protect the ports, and the establishment of a military-style police force to aid in the fight against al-Shabaab.Measures such as these will allow Somalia to“regain its place as a sovereign nation” after almost three decades of civil war, he says.Rather than piracy, the biggest obstacle to progress currently is al-Shabaab.Close-quarters assassinations“Mogadishu is still very, very dangerous. There are a lot of close-quarters assassinations. We had a vehicle-borne IED just the other day,” he says.The other, related, issue is that of corruption, which Reynolds says is a“way of life” in Somalia.“In many ways you can’t blame the Somalis. It was the way they survived. And al-Shabaab are at the route of all corruption. It’s endemic.”The historic lack of a strong central government can also frustrate reform efforts.“You think you have a grasp on what’s going on, you think you’re moving forward, then all the pieces change. The guy you’re dealing with is swapped to another job and suddenly no one is responding to our phone calls.”Nevertheless, he is cautiously hopeful about the future. Reynolds has been in Somalia in various positions for four years now.“It is a positive trend but you have to be here for four years to see the positive trend. If you’re here for six or eight months you can’t see it.”Although the country is still extremely dangerous, violence has decreased and economic life has started to return to the streets of the capital, he says.Reynolds’s term is up at the end of the year. He says if his mandate is renewed he will have to consult with his family and the Irish Government before deciding to stay on.“I think if it was offered I would be very open to seeing this out. I think we’re making a difference.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4321013.1596475308!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ethics watchdog backs staff called lazy by ff s marc macsharry","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMarc MacSharry: ‘Not getting into inidual cases because they are far too numerous to mention.’The State’s ethics watchdog has expressed pride in the work of its “professional and dedicated staff” after it emerged that it was the agency cited by Government backbencher Marc MacSharry, in complaints about “lazy” public servants who “lie on the couch and watch box sets”. Mr MacSharry named the agency, the Standards in Public Office Commission (Sipo) at Fianna Fáil’s parliamentary party meeting, several colleagues confirmed. One backbencher said “he was expressing his frustration” about difficulties in making contact with State agencies during the Covid-19 pandemic. In controversial remarks in the Dáil last week the Fianna Fáil Sligo-Leitrim TD accused public servants of laziness and said he had had “dealings” recently with one State agency “where no one will be back in that office until the end of August”. They are working from home and “you have to talk to an answering machine”. He had praised the work of some public servants in their efforts to deal the pandemic. But he contrasted that with “many elements” in the public service who are “using this situation as cover to lie on the couch and watch box sets, returning an odd call here and there and doing the maximum of the minimum to tick over during this period”. Head of ethics and lobbying regulation for Sipo Sherry Perrault said that like all public bodies and many private ones Sipo is working remotely during the public health crisis. “Throughout this period of disruption and uncertainty, the commission has worked to ensure the continued and effective delivery of its mandate, in particular, timely support and guidance to stakeholders with statutory obligations.” Bullish MacSharryShe said “secretariat staff members are currently working remotely and have maintained services to stakeholders throughout this period. The commission is proud of the work of its professional and dedicated staff, who have adapted quickly and well to the change in circumstances and are continuing to deliver effectively on the commission’s statutory mandate.” Contacted for his response Mr MacSharry said he was “not getting into inidual cases because they are far too numerous to mention”. But he said “I welcome the fact that two days after my remarks, and the reaction that it procured” a circular was issued last Thursday “that everybody should unless absolutely necessary be back in their normal place of work, which I think is in line with the public health advice and it’ll serve society better”. Mr MacSharry was referring to a shift in Government policy last week when public sector staff were told they would be required to return to workplaces “when and as necessary, and deemed appropriate by their employer”."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Australian state to deploy military, impose hefty fines to enforce Covid-19 isolationNorth Korea subject to UN sanctions since 2006 over nuclear and ballistic missile programsAt least 29 killed in terror group\u0026rsquos assault on prison in eastern city of JalalabadPolice officers and government officials suspended following deaths in Punjab stateInfections surge in Latin America while China reports highest total since MarchPro-democracy opposition, which was seeking a majority, says move politically motivatedCountry records first Covid death after finding virus lurking in tourist city of DanangInternational lawmakers condemn move as \u0026lsquounacceptable obstructions of democratic process\u0026rsquoAustralian state reports daily record of 723 new infections as PM calls for patienceNajib convicted of all seven charges in first trial linked to multibillion dollar scandalHarry Harris\u0026rsquos facial hair had offended some South Koreans with reminder of Japanese ruleGood-natured crowd witnesses Chinese officials moving in as US consulate closesExperts say unfolding disaster exacerbated by mistimed lockdown ordered by Narendra ModiMove is seen as a retaliation for China\u0026rsquos removal from its consulate in Houston, TexasThere is a real fear in China that things are starting to spin out of controlRecord 10 deaths confirmed as Victoria\u0026rsquos second wave is driven by workplace spreadLockdown declared in border town as \u0026lsquorunaway\u0026rsquo returns from South - state media\u0026lsquoWhy are they playing Radiohead?

Photograph: Yorgos KarahalisBloombergIn case you’re wondering, yes, “pandemic” is a Greek word, meaning “affecting all the people”. Which is one reason why Greece has taken the Covid virus so seriously, and with such success.The disparate responses to coronavirus among EU member states and, of course, worldwide, suggests that each state responds according to its weaknesses, needs, fears and external influences.It would be unrealistic for an EU summit to attempt to impose rules on social distancing in every member state, but the lack of a unanimous, unified EU policy on the virus means there are no universal European rules about inter-state travel, testing for infection or contact tracing, leading to widespread confusion about what is permitted or even advisable. It is notable that the European country that was most successful in restricting Covid should be one of the most at risk once the gates were opened. However cautious the authorities have been, the inevitable – and foreseen – increase in infections has underlined the dilemma.In Greece, once the airports opened from July 1st onwards, at least 50 per cent of infections were identified at points of entry. In Corfu, where I live, the numbers infected went from 0 to 29 during July the carriers were Serbs, Bulgarians, British, German and French. The rates on the single land border with Bulgaria were so high that Greece insisted that anyone presenting themselves at that point must show a negative test conducted within the previous 72 hours. Serbian visitors were banned absolutely.So sharp was the rise in infections in the last week of July that a return to the familiar restrictions is contemplated. Masks are now mandatory in all confined public places.Patriotism and nationalismThe pandemic has demonstrated the narrow line between xenophilia (the natural courtesy towards guests) and xenophobia (fear of what the foreigner might bring). It has also shown the difference between patriotism and nationalism. One appeals to a sense of responsibility and loyalty the other to a sense of identity and security. The term “pandemic” applies not only to Covid and other destroyers of life and liberty: as an adjective, it reflects the ultimate aspirations of the EU: to embrace all people within its remit in the same egalitarian and inclusive way of life. In this, Covid has shown how deeply it has failed.With the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Finland (the “frugals”) opposing the proposed financial package at July’s EU summit, and Hungary and Poland giving cause for concern over the “rule of law”, the southern states most hit by the virus, in terms of tourism – Spain, Italy, Greece and Croatia – run the risk of being ignored in both political and financial terms. Meanwhile, non-EU states such as Turkey see themselves as exempt from any common approach to a universal problem. “Covid” simply means different threats and opportunities depending on where you sit.There is a massive ision between those who espouse “do as you would be done by” and the Nimbies (“not-in-my-backyard”). Every country protects itself but also yields to its weaknesses. Greece’s weakness is its sunshine. If Greece were Finland or Greenland, the threat to its economy would be minimal.Meanwhile, another kind of “nimby” manifested itself in Corfu, where huge local protests were voiced when prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis personally endorsed an embryonic exclusive tourism resort during a visit to the island. Despite opposition by the local authority, public opinion and wealthy local landowners including the Rothschild family, the government actively supports the project by US-based NCH Capital on the deserted, pristine headland of “Erimitis”. It’s an example of the need for Greece to attract foreign investment, in this case at the cost of diminishing the unique ecosystem of the area. Erimitis contributes nothing to the national economy except its beauty and tranquillity. So in terms of productivity, it’s a waste of space. Thus it also highlights the eternal debate in Greece between the need to modernise and to capitalise on its assets, and the issue of identity and what constitutes “Greekness” for both the country and its people, their culture and their traditions. Almost every year, those responsible for developing tourism policies declare the end of “mass tourism” – resorts and cruise ships being the most obvious examples – and every year more resorts are built and more cruise ships are accommodated. A self-contained resort, like that planned for Erimitis, or a cruise ship docking in Corfu for less than 24 hours, contribute almost nothing to the local economy.The other options – the much vaunted development of niche markets such as wine and food tours, festivals of literature, film and music, ski slopes, ing schools, or hill-walking – don’t get the support or encouragement at national level that they need to enter the international tourism market. Highlighting skills in cuisine and viniculture, visual arts, music and handcrafts could not only enhance Greece as a tourist destination but open markets worldwide.Brenda Fitzsimons takes a look at the recent flooding from an Irish Air Corps helicopterStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Other countries \u0026lsquodefinitely should not do what we have done\u0026rsquo, Israeli government adviser warnsAgreement also reached to join forces with the military in conflict with Houthi rebels\u0026lsquoShield of Israel\u0026rsquo plan devised after government\u0026rsquos response to the second wave widely seen as chaoticGrouping of countries looking east called \u0026lsquoaxis of the sanctioned\u0026rsquoKing Abdullah warns move could destabilise not only the kingdom but the entire regionPrime minister Omar Razzaz says Israel\u0026rsquos annexation plan would destabilise regionRampant inflation and 30 per cent unemployment places huge strain on societyHopewell Chin\u0026rsquoono seized as part of a crackdown on anti-corruption protestersIsraeli prime minister still awaiting final approval from Washington for implementation of controversial planGovernment under pressure as initial lifting of restrictions now seen as having been too rapidEndeavour intended to stoke Arab and Muslim pride over rich heritage of discoveryCases confirmed in doctors and nurse with concern virus will move fast through campsHealth officials say country in \u0026lsquodangerous place\u0026rsquo after early success in curbing epidemicSpeculation grows that \u0026lsquofire\u0026rsquo may have been deliberate attack on facilityIsrael\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4318845.1596206285!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk outlines brexit talks timetable running into october","story":"The UK and the European Union have agreed to continue discussing a free trade deal until October 2nd, British chief negotiator David Frost said on Friday.“Negotiating rounds will take place in August and in September, unless agreed otherwise between the parties,” according to a document Mr Frost posted on Twitter.A fifth round of Brexit talks between ended last week with both sides saying they were still far from reaching an agreement.

The rover will drill into rocks in the hope of discovering any signs of life.Dr Galofre and colleagues analysed valleys on Mars to determine the different ways in which they could have been shaped.They found most were similar to those eroded by either rivers or water in channels beneath ice sheets in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago.Dr Grau Galofre said: Understanding the climate in the first billion years of Mars\u0027 history is important in determining whether the planet was ever habitable.”The researchers looked at over 10,000 Martian valleys using an algorithm to infer their underlying erosion processes.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"metal detectorist guards 100k hoard silver two sleepless nights","story":"A metal detectorist spent two nights guarding the hoard of £100,000 worth of silver civil war coins he had discovered for fear that “nighthawks” would steal the trove if he went home.Luke Mahoney, 40, was scouring for precious metals near the Lindsey Rose Pub, in Ipswich, Suffolk, with his two friends last Sunday morning when he found a “beautiful” gold coin and a sixpence on the field.The group took a break for lunch and returned to the site to find that a plough had cracked a clay earthenware pot buried 2ft beneath the ground.By the end of the afternoon, Mr Mahoney, who has been metal detecting for over a decade, was “delighted” to have helped unearth 1,078 silver, hammered coins, including some possibly dating back to the 15th century. “They were everywhere. It was pandemonium. After ten minutes of searching I hit this massive signal and I thought \u0027this is it\u0027. We dug and saw the pot. That feeling of scraping the dirt away and seeing the coins is indescribable,” he said.The coins were likely buried by a wealthy landowner who had gone off to fight in the English Civil War, according to valuation experts, who believe they will sell at auction for a minimum of £100,000.In order to protect the finds, Mr Mahoney has revealed how he spent two sleepless nights in his car on the field watching for “nighthawk” detectorists hoping to loot the coins under the cover of darkness.Nighthawks, the term for illegal metal detectorists, have previously targeted numerous historic sites, including the Brunton Turret section of Hadrians Wall in their search for ancient artefacts.Mr Mahoney feared the treasures he discovered would be sold onto the black market by unscrupulous dealers who would use the history of the coins to boost their prices online.He told The Daily : “I had to stay up because I didn\u0027t want other people going into the fields and stealing the coins. I was getting an hour nap here and there for around two nights in a row.” “These nighthawks are professional thieves who make their living by waiting for detectorists to leave the fields and scavenge anything that is left over.” His anxieties seemed to be validated a few days ago when he found a casing from a headphone in the field, indicating someone had sneaked in to search for any remnants of the hoard.Despite the threat from “nighthawks”, Mr Mahoney, who owns Joan Allen Electrics, a metal detecting shop in Kent, is encouraging more people to take up his beloved hobby.He credits his success to the “unique” metal detector he was using, the Minelab Equinox 800, and thanks the owner of the Lindsey Rose Pub for allowing him to search around the premises.Following the discovery of his “biggest hoard”, Mr Mahoney immediately contacted the local finds liaison officer, who is currently assessing the coins, and declared the treasure to the coroner.“I want the coins to go to a local museum and the money from their sale as a little something for me and my two friends, Dan Hunt and Matt Brown, who found them with me,” he added.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel latest virus free italy pleads return british tourists","story":"The majority of Europeans would rather cancel a trip than be forced to wear face masks outsideCan I visit Spain?

This comes after Germany this week imposed a mandatory Covid-19 test for travellers arriving from 130 countries.Half of French respondents said they would rather cancel than test, and the same percentage would call off a trip if they had to wear a mask outdoors.Many European destinations have rolled out compulsory mask-wearing in public.

We paid £636 for a two-night stay checking in on April 8. Secret Escapes’ booking terms said that the reservation was non-­refundable if we cancelled.In the event we didn’t cancel ourselves, but the hotel was closed due to the coronavirus lockdown so we couldn’t stay. The Oxford Thames ­Hotel’s reservations manager said he could not process a refund and advised us to contact Secret Escapes to seek reimbursement. But Secret Escapes continues to insist that it does not have to repay us because of the “no refunds” clause in its terms and that the reason for the cancellation is immaterial. Surely this can’t be right: to take money for a service that cannot be provided? Read our consumer expert Gill Charlton\u0027s advice.Reyes Maroto, the Spanish tourism minister, said:It is a decision of the British authorities, but we have given them all the arguments so that they can trust that their tourists are safe in Spanish destinations.If it is not the decision we expect, we will continue working with them.For us, the best news is to have the destination open with the United Kingdom, which is our main issuing market.We have the best protocols and are highly valued by the tourists themselves, who have transferred to their government that they feel safe in Spain. The list of destinations includes a number of popular spots in Italy, France and Turkey.Lyon and Bordeaux in France, plus Bodrum in Turkey, feature on the list, alongside long-haul destinations like Antigua.British Airways said the routes would be operated on low frequencies due to the ongoing impact of Covid-19.Italy is desperate for the return of British holidaymakers and has proclaimed itself as “up and running again” as a travel destination. The comments by the country’s foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, come as fears grow of a second wave of coronavirus infections across Europe. “Britons who decide to spend their holiday in Italy will find not just the beautiful country that we all know but the enthusiasm and energy of a people who are getting going again after living through a dramatic period,” he told the Times. “British citizens visiting Italy will find a safe country because the epidemiological situation is under control.”Italy was the first European epicentre of the coronavirus and initially criticised for its handling of the pandemic, but now it has one of the lowest infection rates on the Continent, less than half that of the UK.Last month Carolyn Spinks, chief operation officer of Abtoi, the Association of British Tour Operators to Italy, told  Travel the country faces economic disaster without tourism.

Not only is it on the FCO “safe” list of destinations that don’t require self-isolation on return, but Covid-19 numbers have been remarkably low. Granted, this is a small country with a population of fewer than nine million, but cases have ­totalled around 35,000 to date (compared to the UK’s 300,000) and deaths have remained below 10 per day for the past three months.For plenty of other reasons, a trip to Switzerland seems like the ideal antidote to lockdown. From walking to picnicking and from swimming to cycling, it is almost laughably easy to enjoy the great outdoors here. Even in town, there is open air – most places have a lake, pool or swimming baths ­complete with a wooden scaffold of stepped ing platforms, from low-slung to ear-popping, and somewhere good to eat and drink nearby.Read her love letter to Switzerland.Away from coronavirus, firefighters are tackling a blaze in the mountains east of Los Angeles. Evacuation orders remained in place early on Monday for thousands of people after a wildfire in mountains east of Los Angeles exploded in size and forced crews to battle flames in triple-digit heat.The Apple Fire in Riverside County consumed more than 31 square miles of dry brush and timber, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.As of Monday morning, it was five per cent contained. The cause was under investigation.The blaze began on Friday as two adjacent fires in Cherry Valley, an unincorporated area near the city of Beaumont about 85 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.Lufthansa is to resume services to Germany from Birmingham, Edinburgh and Glasgow. The airline said from today it will restart a daily flight from the Midlands to Munich. It said: With flights arriving in under two hours, holidaymakers can take advantage of the short hop to Bavaria’s capital and enjoy the art museums, Neo-Gothic landmarks, such as the popular Neues Rathaus (town hall) with its daily glockenspiel show, or head further afield to visit the famous 19th century Neuschwanstein Castle.The German flag carrier says it is now operating 198 weekly flights from the UK and Ireland to nine hubs across Europe. Mart Stratton has had the summer holiday we all want. Look right when entering Katapolo Bay and you will see Erato, Zeus’s muse, lyre pressed against her chest, her marbled gaze, faraway.

Neither too, anything about coronavirus.

However, from August 11, incoming travellers and residents arriving from certain countries will be allowed to self-isolate in a private residence for 14 days so long as they wear the device.Anyone arriving from Australia (excluding Victoria), New Zealand, Brunei, Macao, mainland China, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam can serve their stay home notice at a place of residence. Everyone else has to isolate at a state-appointed facility, at their own expense if they are not a Singaporean citizen or permanent resident.The monitoring system is similar to an electronic band rolled out in Hong Kong in March to ensure arriving passengers were following quarantine guidelines. South Korea has also introduced a wristband connected to a smartphone app, to detect those who are violating quarantine rules.Details on how exactly the device will work are still to be announced, although it will only be mandatory for those aged 12 and over.Read the full story. Delta has boasted it is the only airline operating between London and New York that keeps its middle seats empty to enable some sort of social distancing in the sky.The American carrier has today resumed its daily service between Heathrow and JFK and says it will keep capacity on its aircraft capped until the end of September to help protect the health and safety of its customers and crew.Seat blocks will be automatically implemented to prevent the adjacent seat being booked once a reservation is complete and seats are chosen, the airline said. Parties of three or more will be able to book seats together, including middle seats.Passengers and cabin crew will also be expected to wear face masks while travelling. The majority of airlines have rejected the idea of blocking the middle seat as it would prove economically damaging. However, while demand remains low in the wake of the pandemic, passengers on some carriers will find it easier than others to maintain social distance. A couple wear facemasks as the sun sets in New YorkAnd here is some more detail from my colleague, Ben Parker, on yet another coronavirus outbreak on a cruise ship.A cruise ship in the South Pacific has been forced to return to shore after a case of coronavirus was confirmed on board.Paul Gauguin Cruises’ eponymous vessel, the sole ship in its fleet, only resumed holidays on June 29 following an industry-wide pause in operations. The vessel began its current voyage in Papeete, capital of French Polynesia, with around 350 on board – including passengers and crew – and was sailing between Bora Bora and the Rangiroa islands when an on-board doctor diagnosed Covid-19. It has now returned to Tahiti, and  Travel understands the affected passenger has been taken ashore along with their family. Local media reports that the positive case is an American tourist, and that her family have tested negative.There are a number of measures in place on the ship to thwart the spread of Covid-19, including a reduction in capacity and the removal of buffet meals. At embarkation, all passengers who have been in the country for less than two weeks are required to produce a negative Covid-19 test as well as undergo a health check on board. The cruise line, which is a subsidiary of French operator Ponant, has been contacted for comment.The news is a further blow to the beleaguered cruise industry and comes after at least 40 passengers and crew who had been on board MS Roald Amundsen in Norway tested positive for the virus. Of the ship’s 158 staff, 36 are infected. Read the fully story. Global airline capacity has crept above 50 per cent for the first time since the pandemic, new figures show, fuelling optimism that the world\u0027s travel industry could be set for a recovery.John Grant, an analyst at OAG, said scheduled passenger seats was now up to 60 million, up 4 per cent on last week, and now 50.4 per cent of last year\u0027s capacity. There are undoubtedly some markets where capacity is returning to previous year levels and others where further growth remains out of reach pending lockdowns being eased, he said. The United Kingdom reported the largest weekly capacity increase amongst the top ten countries with a near 20 per cent increase and some 230,000 additional seats added. Easyjet added a further 115,000 seats to their network of which 20,000 were to Spain (that may now be changing!) and both Greece and France had seen a further 12,000 seats added.He said that there are currently 638 airlines operating around the world, down from 716 last year.Given the market conditions and outlook for the coming months it is likely that many of those will be probably not be operating again in the near future, he said. The latest tourist statistics for Portugal have been released by the country\u0027s Instituto Nacional de Estatística (INE).The number of overnight stays by foreign tourists in June fell 96 per cent compared to last year, the INE said.Portugal remains off the UK Foreign Offices list of \u0027safe\u0027 countries, heavily restricting the number of British holidaymakers making the trip. Beach resorts in Portugal are all-but emptyThe Cavendish hotel in the heart of Mayfair, London, reopened over the weekend. See here for the latest information on all the best hotels in the UK that have now reopened their doors once again. Up to 30 people can now meet outside in Wales while maintaining social distancing, with pubs and restaurants in the country able to open indoors.Children under the age of 11 no longer need to keep two metres from each other or adults, following scientific evidence that the risk of transmission is lower among that age group.Changes to coronavirus regulations in Wales on Monday also include pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes being able to reopen indoors as well as bowling alleys, auction houses and bingo halls.Licensed wedding venues will be able to reopen to provide wedding ceremonies - though indoor receptions are still banned.On Sunday, Public Health Wales said that a further three deaths had been reported, taking its total for Wales to 1,565 deaths. A further 37 positive cases were recorded, bringing the total figure in Wales to 17,315.Follow the latest on the coronavirus on our live blog here. Hurtigruten has suspended all of its expedition cruises after a coronavirus outbreak on one of its ships.All guests on board MS Roald Amundsen have been told to quarantine after 36 crew members of several guests tested positive for Covid-19. The line has now said all its sailings will be cancelled until further notice. In light of the recent increase in new cases of Covid-19 globally, the only responsible choice is to suspend all expedition sailings until we are absolutely confident, we can carry out our operations in line with all requirements from the Authorities and with the even stricter requirements we have set for ourselves.Hurtigruten is as of Monday in the process of reaching out to and informing guests booked on the now cancelled voyages.The staff, of which there were 160 in total, were tested at the end of a seven-day sailing around the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard on Friday, with 177 passengers on board none of whom reported any symptoms of the virus while onboard and all of whom had disembarked by the time the news broke.The Australian city of Melbourne has been plunged into further lockdown to stem the tide of new coronavirus cases. Melbourne now finds itself back at square one, with a harsher Stage 4 lockdown now underway. How does this feel exactly? Like hearing ‘False start!’ three-quarters through a Tough Mudder trail.Expected to last a minimum of six weeks, Australia’s toughest restrictions to date include a nightly curfew between 8pm and 5am for those not at work, three-mile restrictions for all shopping and exercising, and the expected closure of non-essential retail outlets. Rumours of abattoir shutdowns have switched-up the panic buying from toilet rolls to mince.The biggest driver of Melbourne’s new infections are symptomatic locals heading out instead of staying home. On July 30, a doorknock by teams of Australian Defence Force and Department of Health and Human Services officers found that more than a quarter of residents who had tested positive for Covid-19 weren’t home. Many have been at work, sparking Covid-19 hotspots that now include over 60 aged-care facilities.Then there are those simply too bored or defiant to follow the rules, among them a ban on non-essential trips outside the metropolitan area. This particular no-no didn’t stop one man from zipping up to the New South Wales border (a distance of 199 miles) to buy a Big Mac.

We want to coordinate this well with the states because they need to be able to implement it at airports and train stations, he told German broadcaster ARD on Monday.The country has seen a small uptick in the number of new daily cases, with 1,012 recorded on July 31, the first time in more than a month the figure surpassed 1,000. Healthy restaurant bookings are due to people having spare money from staycations rather than the launch of \u0027Eat Out to Help Out\u0027, the San Carlo group has said. Managing Director Marcello Distefano has said that people who would have spent money going abroad are instead using the extra cash to eat out at restaurants. Discussing the Government’s Eat Out to Help Out scheme he told BBC Radio 4’s The Today Programme: “We had a positive response to our social media last week. We started advertising throughout Thursday and Friday and the bookings are looking quite healthy for this week.“But we are also putting it down to the fact that  we believe there’s a lot of people who are not going on holiday, everyone is calling it a staycation at the moment.”He added that the rise in bookings was not “purely to do with” the Government scheme but instead “people still have some money to spend, they’re not going away but they still want to eat out”. Good morning, here are some of the weekend\u0027s key stories:Victoria declares disaster and sets curfew for Melbourne UK staycations attract large crowds and increase coastguard calloutsSwitzerland and Ireland consider enforcing stricter Covid-19 restrictionsHolland’s top scientists say no to face masks in public placesPolitics latest news: Schools reopening \u0026#39not up for debate\u0026#39 says minister, despite fears it could prompt second waveTravel updates: EasyJet adds more flights following surge in bookingsComment: Eat Out to Help Out is a delicious experiment in market-driven stimulusSeven arrested on suspicion of the murder Alexander KareemRoyals wish the Duchess of Sussex a happy birthday in public show of unityWidow reunited with stolen wedding ring after it was found in a plant potComment: John Hume gave true meaning to the idea of ‘sharing’ in Irish power-sharingHurricane Isaias roars ashore on US East CoastBeach SOS leads to rescue of sailors stranded on Pacific isleAustralian state of Victoria to impose hefty fines to compel Covid-19 isolationAncient Mars was covered in ice sheets meaning life was even more likely, scientists say‘Hero’ father-of-seven died while rescuing his children who got into difficulty at seaUnions demand undercover police catch maskless passengers on Belgian busesDisposable PPE can be converted into fuel rather than being sent to landfill, review findsRoyal Navy will have to be deployed for Channel migrants to be returned to France, says Border Force unionComment: The elderly should be in no rush to pay the BBCWhy at 39, Meghan\u0026#39s tough year may have only just startedBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"workers have go office resent staying home experts say","story":"Workers who have continued to come into the office during the coronavirus pandemic resent their colleagues who work from home and some are being offered extra pay or perks, HR professionals have said.Those who feel that they have taken on extra responsibilities as others work from home or are furloughed have even resorted to launching grievance procedures against their employers, it has emerged.The anger of their colleagues has even seen some furloughed workers asked to return early, it is understood. On the first working day that employers in England can demand their staff return to the office, it was said that bosses have also seen “push back” from those on the other side of the ide who are refusing to return.Katie Jacobs, Senior Stakeholder Lead at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) said that the workplace has been “fractured” by different experiences of the pandemic and bosses are looking for ways to bring back workers both physically and psychologically. “At the beginning the attitude was ‘we are all in this together’ but as time goes on that has dissipated,” she told the .“At the beginning employers were pleasantly surprised that there was a lot of kindness, but that seems to have disappeared and now people are tired, burnt out and fed up. Anecdotally I would say that we are seeing a bit of resentment.“At the beginning there was quite a lot of talk around danger money for front line workers and whether they should be rewarded with extra stuff.“Some employers have paid bonuses or given extra perks like a few days holiday to differentiate those still going in to work.”From August 1 the Government guidance changed meaning employers can now ask employees to return to their workplace so long as they have Covid-19 safety measures in place.But Ms Jacobs estimates that in offices only around 20-30 per cent of the workforce will be expected to come back before the autumn or the end of the year.“There has been some push back from people who are still anxious about returning to the office and even some people not wanting to come back from furlough,” she said.The CIPD are advising employers that there is “no clear reason for a rush to return to work” and bosses should only ask employees to come back if it is essential, safe and mutually agreed.Alan Price, CEO of BrightHR which provides HR support for 33,000 small and medium businesses, said most are not yet requiring all their employees to return, largely due to social distancing measures and to childcare concerns.Mr Price said that for smaller businesses September, when children return to school, will be the “watershed moment”.Many of those working from home are beginning to argue that there has not been a big drop in productivity, and they are spending more time working as they are not having to commute.Since the start of the pandemic BrightHR has recorded a 50 per cent reduction in sickness and a 75 per cent reduction in lateness.But some employers who had asked their workers to return on Monday morning had found that they had not shown up to work but had logged on at home as they had been doing throughout the pandemic.  Mr Price said: “Some employees have pointed out that their contract says that their place of work can be altered, but employers have rightly said that they can alter it but the employee can’t do it themselves. It is the employer who has the control over that.”Some bosses, particularly in small businesses, argue that they cannot give staff the range of tasks or communicate effectively when people are at home, Mr Price said.Ms Jacobs added that employers had reported people refusing to return to the office or come back from furlough with some having even left the city or the country during lockdown.But what is emerging is an “us and them” ision between those who had been furloughed or not and those who were attending work or working from home, Mr Price said.“We have seen grievances from people who have had to go in to work. We have seen some complaints about the fact that their colleagues have no travel time or travel costs and they do,” he pointed out.Under the new rules employees have to return to work if you have been told to do so, unless you can prove your employer is not complying with Covid-secure measures.Ruby Dinsmore, an employment solicitor from Slater and Gordon, said: As an employee you must comply with a reasonable management request.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"easyjet expands schedule ba ryanair holiday bookings summer","story":"Despite the challenges, British holidaymakers are still booking flights this summerHow to get travel insurance should you choose to ignore Foreign Office advice The safest destinations for a last-minute summer holidaySign up to  Travel\u0027s newsletterEasyJet has announced it will be returning more of its fleet to service than previously planned this summer thanks to stronger bookings than anticipated.Even in the face of ongoing travel restrictions, the budget carrier said late-season sales were “performing well” and that it will fly 40 per cent of its capacity for the rest of the summer, as opposed to its earlier target of 30 per cent.The airline\u0027s key competitors are also posting promising figures.

A number of flights to the area have since been cancelled. Thalia Bohl-Van Den Boogaard, the representative of a group of Indigenous Australians protesting against visitors, told Reuters: “It’s up to tourists to stay away if they come from hotspots or are sick.”She added: “People here have been locked in their communities for months and months to contain the spread, and now it’s not up to them to do the right thing.”Around 350 tourists have visited the park since state borders reopened in July.Closed to visitorsThe Philippines has reinstated a stricter lockdown on its capital, Manila, from today after warnings from medical groups over the weekend that hospitals are losing the battle against the coronavirus.Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippine president, apologised as the number of Covid-19 cases breached 100,000 and he reintroduced a “modified enhanced community quarantine” that will restrict the operations of non-essential businesses and only allow people to leave home for work or to buy food. We\u0027re doing our very best. Sorry, Manila, said Mr Duterte during a televised broadcast late on Sunday evening. The 103,185 case count and 2,059 death toll is second only to Indonesia in Southeast Asia, despite bringing the economy to its knees by previously imposing one of the longest and strictest quarantine periods in the world, from March 15 to June 1. Empty check-in counters in Manila today as domestic flights were cancelledIt\u0027s the question on many lips at the moment: how is the FCO making decisions about which countries aren\u0027t safe to visit at the moment?Analysis by the , carried out in the wake of Portugal’s second exclusion from the Foreign Office’s ‘safe’ list, found that the country had lower Covid-19 rates than many “green” countries Britons were allowed to visit.Likewise, Spain was frustrated when the travel ban was extended to cover its popular islands, despite the likes of Majorca and Ibiza having low infection rates. Hugh Morris asked an expert how they would manage the situation if were they in the hot seat.Here\u0027s what Lloyd Figgins, a former soldier turned travel risk advisor, had to say:In the case of Spain, you have to look at data from the entire country. Domestic tourism had been open for a while before Spain accepted international tourists. In regions such as Aragon, the infection rate has risen by more than 200 per cent in two weeks and invariably residents of these badly infected areas have travelled to other regions of Spain, including the Canary and Balearic Islands. Travel decisions need to be based on sound risk management facts and by understanding who might be harmed and how. Making decisions based on commercial or emotional requirements simply don’t work in a time of crisis. They are ineffectual and cloud the facts.Read his full verdict here.The bosses of Britain’s biggest independent travel agent called on Boris Johnson to save summer by restarting flights to the Spanish islands as they cut up to a fifth of their 4,500-strong workforce, reports Oliver Gill.Hays Travel owners John and Irene Hays said some of the 878 jobs at risk could be saved if the Government introduces “regional travel corridors” to the Spanish islands. The firm is being forced into sweeping cutbacks after ministers re-imposed a blanket quarantine on arrivals from Spain on July 25, dealing a brutal blow to the industry on the first weekend of the summer school holiday season.The decision sent sales back to where they were at the start of lockdown when demand had totally collapsed, Ms Hays said.

On holiday, often to my wife’s irritation, I seek out relics of the past with the same relish that most people my age search for “Instagrammable” cocktail bars. But I’ve never been to the birthplace of democracy, the cradle of western civilisation – which sits in the shadow of the Parthenon, arguably the most recognisable ancient ruin one Earth.Perhaps easyJet is to blame. Why? Read his story to find out.Unesco has released findings that show as of July 20, less than 60 per cent of its World Heritage Sites have reopened. Protected attractions remain closed with 71 countries, largely in Asia and Central America, but also in New Zealand and the Gulf states. In Europe, however, most of Unesco\u0027s sites are fully or partially open to visitors, with the exception of Ireland.Former prime minister Tony Blair said a mass testing regime - covering people who are not displaying coronavirus symptoms - is essential to avoid the need for another lockdown.On some estimates 70 per cent of people with the disease are asymptomatic, so if you are only testing people with symptoms you are losing the majority of people from your testing strategy, he told Times Radio.Without a vaccine or an effective treatment, mass testing is the only way to control the spread of the virus, he said.In a think tank for his Institute for Global Change, it was proposed that testing every passenger entering the UK, five days after their arrival, could cut quarantine time from 14 days to five.Australia\u0027s second-most populous state Victoria said on Tuesday anyone who has contracted Covid-19 and caught outside their home in breach of isolation orders will face fines of nearly A$5,000 (£2,722).Victoria state earlier this week imposed a nightly curfew, tightened restrictions on people\u0027s movement and ordered large parts of the local economy to close.But state Premier Daniel Andrews said nearly a third of those who had contracted Covid-19 were not home when checked on by officials, requiring tough new penalties to stop community transmission. Read more: Australian city shuts non-vital businesses to curb spreadA postcard from Melbourne, where residents are breaking the draconian lockdown to buy Big MacsWhat we learnt:Virus-free Italy pleads for return of British touristsBritish Airways to resume flights to 17 destinations in August Uber Boat launches in LondonPolitics latest news: Schools reopening \u0026#39not up for debate\u0026#39 says minister, despite fears it could prompt second waveComment: Eat Out to Help Out is a delicious experiment in market-driven stimulusSeven arrested on suspicion of the murder Alexander KareemRoyals wish the Duchess of Sussex a happy birthday in public show of unityWidow reunited with stolen wedding ring after it was found in a plant potComment: John Hume gave true meaning to the idea of ‘sharing’ in Irish power-sharingHurricane Isaias roars ashore on US East CoastBeach SOS leads to rescue of sailors stranded on Pacific isleAustralian state of Victoria to impose hefty fines to compel Covid-19 isolationAncient Mars was covered in ice sheets meaning life was even more likely, scientists say‘Hero’ father-of-seven died while rescuing his children who got into difficulty at seaUnions demand undercover police catch maskless passengers on Belgian busesDisposable PPE can be converted into fuel rather than being sent to landfill, review findsComment: The elderly should be in no rush to pay the BBCRoyal Navy will have to be deployed for Channel migrants to be returned to France, says Border Force unionWhy at 39, Meghan\u0026#39s tough year may have only just startedDonald Trump threatens to sue Nevada to stop mail-in ballotsBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"elderly should no rush pay bbc","story":"Over-75-year-olds are worried now that, from the first of this month, payment for their television licences has fallen due. They should not be, says the TV Licensing website: they will be “supported through the changes”. “TV Licensing will write to all licence holders aged over 75 with clear guidance about how to pay,” says the BBC, which is a polite way of saying, “We know where you live.”But do they? If I were in the “at risk” category, I would not – Heaven forfend – advocate non-payment, but I might lie low. After all, the free-licence privilege has existed for 20 years, so the BBC’s database must itself be pretty elderly. Since it has not been demanding money of the old since the year 2000, it presumably has no accurate way of telling whether the people it has sent free licences to are still alive. You are supposed to say on voter registration forms if you are over 75, but it would surely be an abuse of data privacy if this information were transferred to the BBC. If you are dead, even the BBC cannot get £157.50 out of you.In my flat in London, where I do not have a television, I receive a steady stream of letters in brown envelopes from TV Licensing. My current pile adds up to 76 of them. They often carry threats on the envelope (“Investigation has started in your area”), but I refuse to answer or even open them, since I do not see why I should be compelled to inform anyone that I do not have a television.Despite the threats, nothing ever happens to me. TV Licensing has no legal right – contrary to what it implies – to enter your property. I wonder how, in the era of Covid-19, the BBC proposes to chase the old whom it suspects of evasion. Will it dare get a warrant to knock down the front doors of 90-year-olds wearing masks, and then drag them to the magistrates’ courts? Surely not. Old people can scarcely be blamed if they sit tight and wait for the Corporation to fulfil that promise to “help them through the changes”.A new report from Policy Exchange, Academic Freedom in the UK, makes clear that such freedom is not secure. Its survey finds that only 20 per cent of British-based academics vote for “right-wing” parties (ie the Conservatives and further right), whereas 75 per cent vote Labour, Liberal Democrats or Green. The disproportion between Leavers and Remainers is similar.Worse, intellectually, is the “self-censorship” which many feel they must practise in order to keep their jobs. The point of the “cancel culture”, after all, is to destroy certain iniduals.It is nothing new that universities are more left-wing than the general population – though it does seem that the lack of ersity of opinion is greater than ever. As the excellent Canadian satirist, Ryan Long, puts it in his woke YouTube persona, “When I learned that ersity meant hiring a bunch of different colours of people who agree with me, I was all in.”But this goes deeper than disagreement. In the doctrines which lie behind organisations such as Black Lives Matter, Extinction Rebellion and their campus equivalents, the very idea of disagreement evaporates. There is no such thing as the other person’s point of view. That is just a smokescreen put up, they say, by the white supremacists who have dominated Western culture up until now. Traditional ideas of history or literature are automatically “colonial”.There can be no discussion about this, they go on, because that would be to collude with the structures of oppression. Instead there is the idea of “hurt”. If you feel that a professor or his views are “offensive”, you are considered unarguably right, certainly if he is white and male. If such attitudes rule universities, the very idea of a university vanishes.A couple of weeks ago, I mentioned how the exciting appearance of a solitary Bearded Vulture in the Peak District had been grabbed by animal-rights zealots to pursue their obsessions, helped by credulous media.Tim Birch, an Extinction Rebellion supporter and employee of the Derbyshire Wildlife Trust, declared that the vulture was threatened by grouse shooters when the season opens on 12 August.This column pointed out that even the wickedest gamekeeper would have no interest in killing the vulture, since it preys only on dead birds.Now Mr Birch has switched the focus of his attack. Last week, on the BBC’s PM programme, Mr Birch was given space to air his theory that the vulture was in peril from “stink pits” where gamekeepers drop dead animals such as foxes. No expert was given air-time to counter Mr Birch’s theory.So it seems worth saying that stink-pits (more often known as middens) are not used at this time of year, and indeed have become very rare. Besides, they are almost always covered, so no vulture could get in. Mr Birch fears that poor Beardy might get lead-poisoning if he ate, say, a crow which had been shot. This is scarcely more likely than that Mr Birch would suffer if he ate pigeon pie in his Derbyshire local.The only news fact in the Bearded Vulture story is its rare presence in this country (it comes from Switzerland). Its role as victim is fiction.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue

Monday, bringing life-threatening storm surges, as the entire US eastern seaboard battened down, fearing flash floods and destructive winds.The Category 1 hurricane, packing sustained winds of 85 miles per hour (140 kilometres per hour), made landfall in the southern part of the state near Ocean Isle Beach at 11:10 pm (0310 GMT Tuesday), the National Hurricane Center said.It said storm surges could generate inundations three to five feet (one to 1.5 metres) above ground level.The storm was forecast to track up the East Coast, with heavy rainfall expected to cause flash flooding through the mid-Atlantic states and bringing storm-force winds to Washington, Philadelphia and New York on Tuesday.According to the NHC, a tropical storm warning was in effect from Surf City, North Carolina up to Eastport, Maine.A tornado watch was in effect for 30 counties in North Carolina, according to the National Weather Service office in Raleigh.People along the border between North and South Carolina were experiencing power outages and flooding, according to local media.Power company Duke Energy said there had been more than 1,000 outages in the Wilmington area of North Carolina.Santee Cooper, South Carolina\u0027s state-owned utilities company, said more than 6,000 customers had been without power at one point.Residents in flood-prone areas should take all necessary actions to protect life and property from rising water and the potential for other dangerous conditions, the National Hurricane Center said.Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion, it added.President Donald Trump announced earlier Monday he had issued emergency declarations for Florida and both Carolinas, freeing up federal funds.Everyone needs to remain vigilant, he warned during a news conference.I encourage everyone to follow the guidelines of the state and local authorities, he said, adding the guidelines have been very accurate so far.So stay safe, he added.New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy declared a statewide state of emergency ahead of Isaias\u0027s arrival, warning residents to stay off the roads in stormy conditions.The Carolinas have seen a recent surge in coronavirus cases as the US struggles to curb the spread of the illness.We in North Carolina mostly know what to do, the state\u0027s governor, Roy Cooper, said Sunday.You pack your emergency kit, follow local evacuation orders, stay in a safe place and never drive through flooded roadways.But this time, pack your masks and hand sanitizers in your kit and remember to social distance.Up to 150 National Guard soldiers had been activated to help prepare for the storm and assist in the aftermath, if necessary, Cooper said.The storm was earlier downgraded from a Category 1 hurricane after brushing past Florida, leaving the state relatively unscathed, but it picked up strength as it approached the Carolinas.It earlier dumped torrential rain on the Bahamas, felling trees and flooding streets, before emergency management officials on Sunday gave the all clear for the country.At least one person died in Puerto Rico and the storm also lashed Haiti and the Dominican Republic.More from

Potential uses of the helicopter could include scouting ahead of human explorers and  investigating caves and craters. It could also be used to carry small payloads across the planet.Life could exist beneath the surface of Mars, study claimsBy the way, we just had an earthquake in this room, MiMi Aung said. Although objects were rattled, but there has been no significant effects on the launch of the rocket.On Nasa\u0027s livestream, Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine noted it was lucky that the rocket was not launching from Vandenberg Air Force Base, which is also in California and has seen Nasa launches before.Many viewers commented on Twitter that the earthquake was a benefit, as it woke them up in time to watch the Perseverance mission launch.Nasa can only go to Mars once every 26 months, so missing this launch window would mean a cost of half a billion dollars to maintain the rover before it could launch again.The trip to Mars had already been delayed twice before, because of contamination problems and issues with a crane at the pad.More news can be found on The Independent\u0027s liveblog of the launch.The Nasa mission will send the rover Perseverence to search for traces of potential alien life.The car-sized six-wheeled robotic rover, ]will launch atop an Atlas 5 rocket from the Boeing-Lockheed joint venture United Launch Alliance.Officials indicated that all systems appeared ready to go ahead of the launch, with weather forecasts from the Air Force\u0027s 45th Weather Squadron remaining at an 80 percent probability of launch and fuelling preparations underway for the rocket.Perseverance is due to land at the base of an 820-foot-deep (250 meters) crater called Jezero, a former lake from 3.5 billion years ago that scientists suspect could bear evidence of potential past microbial life on Mars. Scientists have long debated whether Mars - once a much more hospitable place than it is today - ever harboured life.Why Nasa\u0027s new Mars rover will be its best yetWater is considered a key ingredient for life, and the Martian surface billions of years ago had lots of it on the surface before the planet became a harsh and desolate outpost.However, scientists are unsure whether alien life could have survived in the water. Although the waters in Martian lakes appear to have a similar pH to that in Earth\u0027s oceans, other scientists have argued that it would be far too cold for life to survive.One of the most complex manoeuvres in Perseverance\u0027s journey will be what mission engineers call the “seven minutes of terror,” when the robot endures extreme heat and speeds during its descent through the Martian atmosphere, deploying a set of supersonic parachutes before igniting mini rocket engines to gently touch down on the planet\u0027s surface.It is the latest launch from Earth to Mars during a busy month of July, following probes sent by the United Arab Emirates and China.Aboard Perseverance is a four-pound (1.8 kg) autonomous helicopter named Ingenuity that is due to test powered flight on Mars for the first time.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Your Mac resumes charging to 100 percent depending on your usage.”Apple says that other reasons your Mac may not be charging is that you might not be using the right power adapter and cable, or that the power source is not delivering enough power.The Cupertino company had already introduced features in May 2020 to change the way that computers charge, by monitoring how the device powers up and pausing it from charging fully.By doing so, this reduces strain on the battery by overloading it with power, although it may leave Macs with less charge than users might expect. That tool, which is also available on iPhones and iPads, can be disabled.Apple’s battery management has caused controversy in the past the company had to pay out $500 million to US users for throttling iPhone performance in order to protect battery life.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.130 30. I Am MotherRickety-looking science fiction thriller I Am Mother delivers where it counts with a twisting, turning plot and several genuine surprises. In the far future, a maternal robot (voiced by Rose Byrne) raises a young woman (Clara Rugaard) as her daughter. But when an outsider (Hilary Swank) makes her way to their bunker their perfect life is shattered forever.In Private Life, a bohemian middle-aged couple struggle to have a child. Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti are hilarious and poignant. And the pathos is piled on as twenty-something college drop-out Sadie (Kayli Carter) parachutes into their life. High-jinks follow, though director Tamara Jenkins ensures the existential sadness that has become part of the protagonists daily life never quite fades. Steven Soderbergh has become something of a Netflix regular, with his Meryl Streep-starring The Laundromat recently premiering on the service. His earlier movie High Flying Bird is about a basketball agent (André Holland) in a game of skulduggery between players (mostly black and uneducated) and team owners (white and wealthy). It’s a great sports film and also a commentary on the racial and social schisms that ide America. 430 27. I Don\u0027t Feel at Home in this World AnymoreA quirky though ultimately quite dark indie movie about two misfits, Ruth (Melanie Lynskey) and Tony (Elijah Wood), on the trail off a burglar who made off with a silver spoon belonging to Ruth’s grandmother. Whimsical on the surface, I Don’t Feel at Home in this World Anymore is in fact a meditation on what happens when you’ve had enough of life’s fundamental unfairness and lash out. Team-up heist movie Triple Frontier stars Ben Affleck, Oscar Isaac, Charlie Hunnum and Pedro Pascal as old marine corps buddies headed to South America for one final pay-day. It’s hugely flawed – but Affleck is convincing as a guy losing his way amidst orce and middle age. And JC Chandor (Collateral) directs the action scenes with pizzaz. It comes close to being a great action flick for grown-ups before ultimately fizzling out. 630 25. A Futile and Stupid GestureStraight-to-video production values don’t do it any favours, but A Futile and Stupid Gesture – a biopic about the founder of American satirical magazine National Lampoon, Douglas Kenney (Will Forte) – has its heart in the right place. It’s a by turns poignant and hilarious accent of Forte’s rise, his descent into drugs and infidelity – and his strained relationship with Lampoon co-founder Henry Beard (an unrecognisable Domhnall Gleeson). Critics trounced this stylised horror starring Jake Gyllenhaal are a vainglorious art critic. Certainly, as commentary on the vacuousness of the art world it’s a whole lot of stating the obvious. Yet enjoyed as a Argento-esque OTT romp, Velvet Buzzsaw is a delight, as director Dan Gilroy subjects his victims to a series of ever more absurdist and grisly ends. El Camino would be higher on the list were it not for the fact it really isn’t a film. Best thought of as a two-hour Breaking Bad episode, it takes up the story of Jesse Pinkman after he’s fled the dying Walter White and driven into the blue yonder. The milieu is the familiar New Mexico underworld of Breaking Bad and its gentler prequel, Better Call Saul. BB fans will nonetheless relish a return, however brief, to the Vince Gilligan expanded universe. Plus all – yes ALL – your faves from the Ballad of Walter White are back for cameos. With his Doctor Sleep adaptation forthcoming, Mike Flanagan has established himself as the latter-day top dog off Stephen King retellings. He gave us a taste of what he was capable of via his gruelling adaptation of 1992 King novel Gerald\u0027s Game, which is about a woman (Carla Gugino) who ends up bound to a bed when her husband dies during a sex game. Don’t try this at a home – or anyone else for that matter – kids. Former Daily Show correspondent Jessica Williams is a revelation in The Incredible Jessica James, which follows a romantically adrift young playwright who tries to come to terms with a break up by projecting blinding over-confidence. She strikes up an unlikely chemistry with Chris O’Dowd’s awkward everyman – with results that achieve a rarefied mix of funny and sweet. Sandra Bullock in a blindfold whispering to two terrified children might not sound like the stuff of blockbuster gold. Sci-fi horror Bird Box is certainly flawed. It also had the ill fortune to come out six months after the thematically adjacent A Quiet Place. Nonetheless, there’s an undeniable pulpy thrill to this tale of aliens that drive you mad on sight (hence the blind-folds). Keep an eye out, too, for a fantastic cameo from Tom Hollander. Ali Wong and Randall Park play former childhood sweethearts from San Fransisco whose lives take very different paths after they consummate their friendship. She becomes a celebrity chef engaged to a dead-eyed property developer he’s a home town schlub still living with his dad. Screwball antics ensue as their paths cross again. So far, so cliche. But there are enough surprises – and one hilarious cameo – to prevent Always Be My Maybe feeling hopelessly formulaic. Magic realism comes to Netflix in this coming-of-age story set in Dakar, Senegal. Ada (Mame Bineta Sane) is betrothed to a wealthy man but then falls in love with construction worker Souleiman (Ibrahima Traoré). When he vanishes her world is tipped head-over-heels. In truth, the bare-bone plot is merely the chassis upon which director Mati Diop drapes a hallucinatory romance and mystery with elements of the supernatural.Anthony Hopkins and Jonathan Price twinkle ecumenically in this two-hander about Pontiffs Benedict XVI (Hopkins) and Francis (Price) who are thrown together at a time of crisis for the Church. The two leads were nominated for Oscars, as was screenwriter Anthony McCarten, adapting his 2019 play of the same name.Netflix has become an unexpected champion of the humble romcom and To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before was the movie that established its reputation in the genre. Lana Condor plays a shy high-school student who writes pretend letters to her crushes. But when the missives are stolen and made public, she feels obliged to enter a fake relationship in order to preserve her dignity. All your favourite romcom tropes are ticked off – but with a knowingness that falls satisfyingly short of cynical.1630 15. The Fundamentals of CaringPaul Rudd takes a break from Ant-Man to play the carer of teenager Trevor (Craig Roberts), who has muscular dystrophy, in The Fundamentals of Caring. A heart-warming road movie ensues as they somehow end up crossing America in the company of flinty hitchhiker Dot (Selena Gomez). Rudd’s likability is dialled all the way up in a feel-good weepie sure to shred the heartstrings1730 14. Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle King of motion capture Andy Serkis ropes in some famous pals – Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett. Benedict Cumberbatch etc – for a fang-baring tilt at Rudyard Kipling. Shunted back because of Disney’s own “live action” Jungle Book remake, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle is far grittier – a children’s movie with enough tooth and claw not to feel like a fairytale. Eddie Murphy puts in one of his best performances in years in Dolemite Is My Name, a biopic about Blaxploitation comedian Rudy Ray Moore, whose potty-mouthed albums and movies in the mid Seventies were credited with helping invent hip hop. Moore’s “Dolemite” character was based on old black homeless man he encountered in San Fransisco and caused both a sensation and a scandal at the time. Murphy brings this complex figure to life with an alternately hilarious and affecting turn. Lovecraftian weirdness by the bucketful from director Alex Garland. Natalie Portman heads a team of researchers venturing into a quarantined swampland where the laws of nature have been rebuilt from the cellular level up. Annihilation is mind-bending body horror, with echoes of Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey.2030 11. Beasts of No NationCary Joji Fukunaga will shortly make his Bond debut with No Time To Die. But he was better known for directing original season of True Detective when his adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala’s Ghanian civil war novel Beasts of No Nation was acquired by Netflix. It’s a nightmarish tale of child soldiers dehumanised by conflict, with Idris Elba chilling as the adult commander of the boy combatants. Netflix has been churning out serviceable horror movies for several years now. Apostle, a Wicker Man updating by Raid director Gareth Evans, features the standard feral yokels, to which he brings his own innovation via oceans of gore. Dan Stevens is a naive outsider who, in 1905, travels to a remote Welsh island hoping to locate his vanished sister. He discovers a cult headed by Michael Sheen’s crazed preacherman, a whole lot of trouble and something terrible hiding in the dark.With Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite winning the Palme d\u0027Or, what better moment to revisit his brilliantly weird and charming morality fable from 2017. Co-written with John Ronson, Okja is a by turns heart-warming and chilling story of a young girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) and her friendship with the titular bio-engineered super-pig. It sounds, and frequently is, bonkers but Joon-ho plays with our heartstrings as if manipulating a Straarius, while Cate Blanchett is outstanding as an evil tech messiah masquerading as an environmentalist. 2330 8. The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson head the cast in Noah Baumbach’s comedy drama The Meyerowitz Stories about worldly Manhattanites struggling with their lives of sophisticated privilege. Baumbach is on solid ground marshalling the inter-familial tension. But he also reminds us why he’s a master at locating universal truths within the self-involved lives of neurotic Americans. Mudbound is an unflinching survey of race and politics in the Southern United States immediately before and after the Second World War. Carey Mulligan and Mary J Blige head the cast, while Dee Rees guides the story with tremendous tautness. Mudbound was expected to receive a clean sweep of Oscar nominations in 2017. In the end it received just four, in relatively minor categories. The first rumblings of Hollywood’s hostility towards streaming and its impact on cinema? Adam Sandler blazes like a diamond-drill in Josh and Benny Safdie’s sensory-rush drama about a jeweller and gambling addict trying to hold onto his sanity as his world comes crashing down. It’s an exhausting, sometimes overwhelming watch – but with Sandler as the audience’s lodestar, it’s a journey worth staying with.Noah Baumbach draws on the breakdown of his marriage to Jennifer Jason Leigh in this unflinching chronicling of a modern orce. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are compelling as a couple who wake one morning to discover they’ve fallen out of love, while Laura Dern deservedly won an Oscar as Johansson’s force-of-nature attorney.2730 4. The Other Side of the WindFor a reminder how unhinged film-making became in the Seventies, buckle up and lose yourself in this posthumous restoration of never-completed Orson Welles movie, The Other Side of the Wind. What would have been Welles’s swansong is a maniacal, meta meditation on art and fame, with John Huston playing a buccaneering director – in essence, a heightened composite of himself and Welles. There are also parts for Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper. Welles’s editor, Bob Murawski, together with Bogdanovich and Welles’s daughter Beatrice, assembled the cut from 100 hours of footage. It only occasionally makes sense – but, as an experience, it\u0027s unforgettable. 2830 3. The Ballad of Buster ScruggsWhen Netflix asked the Coen brothers to make a binge-friendly TV series, Hollywood’s quirkiest siblings obviously went their own way. This anthology movie, titled The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, features six stories set amid the Coens’ deeply quirky and revisionist take on the Old West. The spirit of their classic O Brother, Where Art Thou? is tapped enthusiastically, with Liam Neeson, Zoe Kazan, Tim Blake Nelson, James Franco and Tom Waits heading the starry cast. Teaming up with De Niro, Pacino and Joe Pesci, Martin Scorsese suggested The Irishman might be the cinematic event of the decade. There is certainly lots to love in this generations-ning tale of hitman Frank Sheeran (De Niro) and his relationship with union boss Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino) and his own daughter (Anna Paquin). True, the film isn’t quite a classic at the level of Goodfellas. The de-aging technology employed to turn the cast into thirtysomething gangsters feels rubbery and unconvincing. And the 209-minute running time left many viewers suffering numb bum. But it’s still Scorsese doing mobsters and unmistakably the work of a director reaching for a big artistic statement.The privileged Mexico City childhood of director Alfonso Cuarón inspired his affecting, quasi-autobiographical treatise on class, privilege and love. Yalitza Aparicio is the semi-invisible maid to a wealthy family, her life a story of small moments unfolding against the backdrop of political upheaval. Netflix was denied its Best Picture Oscar for Roma, but Cuarón was an uncontroversial pick for Best Director at the 2018 awards.  130 30.

There\u0027s a feast of One Direction surprises to be found on the digital music serviceWhen five teenage boys decided to audition for The X Factor back in 2010, no one could have predicted just how gargantuan their global impact would be.A decade on, it’s hard to imagine the last 10 years without the biggest boy band of recent history.The band members may have started off on their own, but it was when Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan and Liam Payne joined forces to become One Direction that the epic, record-breaking and award-winning adventure began in a whirlwind of great hair and pop anthems.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTo celebrate this momentous anniversary – five studio albums, 17 singles and nearly nine billion streams later – Spotify has plenty of treats in store for 1D stans across the globe.Created with Sketch.One Direction through the years Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In November 2011, less than a year after coming third on The X Factor, One Direction released their first album, Up All NightThe video for One Thing – the third single released in the UK from One Direction\u0027s debut album – was shot in LondonKiss You, released in January 2013, was the third single released from 1D\u0027s second album, Take Me HomeReleased in November 2013, One Direction\u0027s third studio album featured hit singles Best Song Ever and Story of My LifeThe boy band\u0027s fourth album was released in November 2014Perfect was the second single released from the boy band\u0027s fifth studio album, Made in the A.M.In November 2011, less than a year after coming third on The X Factor, One Direction released their first album, Up All NightThe video for One Thing – the third single released in the UK from One Direction\u0027s debut album – was shot in LondonKiss You, released in January 2013, was the third single released from 1D\u0027s second album, Take Me HomeReleased in November 2013, One Direction\u0027s third studio album featured hit singles Best Song Ever and Story of My LifeThe boy band\u0027s fourth album was released in November 2014Perfect was the second single released from the boy band\u0027s fifth studio album, Made in the A.M.Spotify users more than deserve it: since One Direction released their debut single in 2011, they’ve amassed some more than impressive stats on the streaming service.Not only does the band continue to get more than 19 million monthly listeners, despite having not released an album since 2015, but their tracks are included in more than 65 million playlists on the service – 4.4 million of which are dedicated solely to the music of One Direction.What\u0027s more, in November 2015, the release of Made in the A.M. acquired 106 million streams in its first week of release.The 5 top-streamed One Direction songs on Spotify2.

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots. Keep these four points in mind when preparing for your next staycation…CHECK THE GUIDELINES: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all have different rules in place check their respective tourism sites before you travelBOOK IN ADVANCE: If you’re visiting an attraction, book slots in advance where possibleGO OFF THE BEATEN TRACK: Try to visit less popular places and to avoid overcrowded areasPACK YOUR BAGS: Bring a card for contactless payments and always keep hand sanitiser on youTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You GoPlease keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The reopening of schools in September must be accompanied by a high-coverage test-trace-isolate (TTI) programme if the country is to avoid a second wave of coronavirus infections, a study has suggested.Researchers analysed data from the first wave of Covid-19 and modelled the potential impact of schools in Britain reopening in less than a month to understand how the virus can be kept under control.The study, published in The Lancet Child And Adolescent Health, simulated various scenarios to examine the possible consequences of schools reopening in tandem with parents returning to their offices and increased socialising within the community.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe researchers, from University College London (UCL) and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, found that “with increased levels of testing… and effective contact tracing and isolation, an epidemic rebound might be prevented”.A second study, also published in The Lancet, found low levels of transmissions in schools and nurseries where control measures are in place.Ministers still planning to open all English schools in SeptemberMake face masks mandatory in secondary schools, teachers’ union urgesOldham is back in lockdown because test and trace is failingNHS test and trace reaching fewer close contacts of Covid-19 infectedTest-and-trace preferred to quarantine by most travellers, poll findsDr Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths, who lead the study, said: “Our modelling suggests that with a highly-effective test and trace strategy in place across the UK, it is possible for schools to reopen safely in September.“However, without sufficient coverage of a test-trace-isolate strategy, the UK risks a serious second epidemic peak either in December or February. Therefore, we urge the government to ensure that test-trace-isolate capacity is scaled-up to a sufficient level before schools reopen.”It comes after chief medical officer Chris Whitty warned the public may have to trade some liberties in order to secure others, to prevent losing control of the virus, and a member of the government’s Sage group suggested pubs and other venues may have to close in order for schools to reopen.Professor Chris Bonell, professor of public health sociology at LSHTM and senior author on the study, said the findings should “not be used to keep schools shut” but should be viewed as a “loud call to action to improve the infection control measures and test and trace system”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It all depends on the other measures and the level of TTI coverage,” he said, adding that at the present moment, TTI is “not achieving the levels that we modelled”.“Looking at the NHS reports from the TTI system, it looks like it’s about 50 per cent coverage.“It looks from the ONS data like there are about 4,200 new infections per day. And it looks like from the testing data there are about 4,200 testing positive per week. So it looks like about one in seven. So, that’s not good enough, basically,” added Mr Bonnell.The researchers cautioned that the level of infectiousness in children compared to adults in non-conclusive. The main study used a model that assumed children were as infectious as adults, and they re-ran the model with the assumption that children and young people were half as infectious as adults, with the results remaining the same.The second study looked at real-world data from January to April tracking the spread of coronavirus within 25 schools and nurseries in New South Wales, Australia.School closures will hit UK productivity for years, experts warnIt found that the risk of children and staff transmitting the virus in educational settings was “very low” when contact tracing and other virus control restrictions were in place.Commenting on both studies, Professor W John Edmunds from LSHTM, said: “Both studies give potential options for keeping schools open and show the clear importance of adequate contact tracing and testing.“We urgently need large-scale research programmes to carefully monitor the impact of schools reopening, as Public Health England’s sKID study aims to do. Only in this way can we take the most appropriate measures to mitigate the risks and allow us to reassure parents, pupils and teachers alike that schools are safe to attend.“There are no quick fixes to this terrible pandemic. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that governments around the world need to find solutions that allow children and young adults to return to full-time education as safely and as quickly as possible.”test and trace\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspLondon School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It employs more than two million people, predominantly young people, and it’s important that we continue to support it.”Chief medical officer Chris Whitty previously warned that England was now “near the limit” of the restrictions which can be relaxed without losing control of the virus.He said during a press conference over the weekend: “If we wish to do more things in the future, we may have to do less of some other things.”His warning was echoed in newly-released minutes of a Sage meeting that said: “There may be a need to change measures at the end of the summer in order to be able to keep R below 1 whilst proceeding with the planned reopening of schools.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Joaquin Phoenix and Alicia Silverstone are pleading with the owners of a farm where goats were brutally attacked to hand the animals over to sanctuaries.The Hollywood actors, together with singers Moby and Leona Lewis, Harry Potter star Evanna Lynch and Downton Abbey star Peter Egan, have signed an open letter to the farm, which is linked to the UK’s best-known goat milk producer, St Helen’s Farm. Government, council and trading standards officials are investigating conditions at Far Marsh Farm in East Yorkshire, where three members of staff were sacked and one given a final warning after The Independent exposed shocking scenes of animal brutality behind closed doors.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWorkers were secretly filmed punching, kicking and hitting goats with a pole animals were also painfully slammed on their backs, had their tails twisted or were held by the neck.“We ask you only to do the right thing – allow as many of your goats as possible to be rehomed to sanctuaries, and transition Far Marsh Farm away from animal farming to ensure that no others will ever be abused there again,” the letter says.Activists work to save goats at farm where workers attacked animalsLewis, who is vegan and trustee of an animal sanctuary in Essex, contacted Surge animal rights group, who had first received the footage, after reading The Independent‘s piece exposing the brutality.Marks \u0026amp Spencer and all the big supermarkets except Morrisons said they pulled St Helen’s Farm products, including milk, cheese and butter, from sale after seeing the footage. Angus Wielkopolski, founder of Yorkshire Dairy Goats, which owns the farm, told The Independent last week he may have to close the 4,000-animal site if he cannot salvage its reputation.But since then, Mr Wielkopolski has not been contactable, and the fate of the 4,000 animals is unknown. The Independent is seeking his response to offers to rehome the goats in sanctuaries and to help him find ways to keep his business going without using animals.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Other uses of the land include arable crops, growing pulses and produce for human food, and to rewilding, it saysIt adds: “The farming we propose may be referred to as alternative today, but one day it will be the main form of agriculture, making best use of land and resources and addressing growing environmental pressures production of  their lands.”Phoenix, the star of Joker and also a vegan, is to be an executive producer, with his wife Rooney Mara, of a new documentary on links between factory farming and pandemics.Mara, her actor sister Kate, actress Alexandra Paul, Olympic athlete Dotsie Bausch and actor Lucy Watson also signed the letter.Supermarkets drop goat-milk firm after violent attacks on animalsAt the same time, questions are being raised over the links between Far Marsh Farm and the St Helen’s Farm brand.St Helen’s Farm said Far Marsh Farm was just one of a number of its suppliers, and that it cut ties with the farm after the cruelty was revealed.But it can be revealed that Yorkshire Dairy Goats (YDG), which owns the farm, was previously called St Helen’s Farm Goats, and is registered at St Helen’s Farm’s main office.YDG is part-owned, through a minority investment, by Kavli Investments Ltd, part of Kavli UK Ltd, which also owns the St Helen’s Farm brand.But Kavli has declined to comment on the future of the goats, when pressed by The Independent.A spokeswoman for Kavli UK said answers must come from YDG, adding: “Day-to-day operations and managerial control of Far Marsh Farm is held by Angus and Kathleen Wielkopolski.Goats punched, hit and ‘left lame’ at farm supplying supermarket milk“The fact that St Helen’s Farm stopped taking milk from Far Marsh Farm immediately after we were informed about this mistreatment of animals demonstrates both our commitment to animal welfare and that we will not accept anything other than the highest standards from all of our suppliers. “Under no circumstances will we accept that any of the goats on our supplying farms are mistreated in any way.”Kavli UK bought the St Helen’s Farm dairy from the Wielkopolskis in 2013 and so has full ownership and management responsibility of St Helen’s Farm, she added.“At that time, a minority investment was also made in Yorkshire Dairy Goats, with one of its two farms being Far Marsh Farm, the farm at the centre of this issue.”East Yorkshire council health officers say they are investigating together with government officials from the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA).An APHA spokesperson said: “We are investigating the allegations of animal welfare legislation breaches. Where welfare regulations are breached, appropriate action is taken.“We do not comment on inidual cases.”The RSPCA says it may take action if APHA does not.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Chicks exported to the EU will die unless they can be rushed through the chaos expected at UK ports next year, the government has admitted.A new document warns that Brexit will bring up to 10 months of disruption, with emergency traffic control measures in Kent to last until “the end of October 2021”.It admits a 27-acre “clearance centre” being built near Ashford – which Michael Gove denied would become a giant lorry park – will, in fact, hold around 2,000 trucks.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAnd it raises fears for live products which lose up to 60 per cent of their value if they fail to reach EU destinations “within 1 to 2 days” – in particular day-old chicks. “They cannot be fed in their vehicle, and delays risk dehydration and mortality,” the document, published by transport secretary Grant Shapps, states.Government says medicines must be stockpiled for no-deal BrexitThe document comes after the government advised medicine suppliers to begin stockpiling again for a no-deal Brexit at the end of the transition period, by building up six weeks’ worth of drugs.However, new port checks will be necessary even if the UK avoids crashing out without a deal, because even an agreement will not allow the free-flow of goods that takes place now.When the 2016 referendum was held, Brexit campaigners repeatedly denied such checks would be required – but now describe them as inevitable, under the prime minister\u0027s clean-break plans.The emergency traffic measures are needed because the controls brought in for port approach roads last year – called Operation Brock – lapsed at the end of 2019.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pelicans interact with a visitor in St James\u0027s Park in LondonLewis Hamilton drives with a puncture towards the finish line to win the Formula One British Grand Prix at Silverstone Arsenal\u0027s Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang celebrates with the trophy and teammates after winning the FA Cup, as play resumes behind closed doors following the outbreak of the coronavirus disease People enjoy the sunny weather at a Bournemouth BeachAn artist puts the finishing touches to a wax figure of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, in the entrance line at Madame Tussaud\u0027s in London, as the attraction prepares to reopen to the public following the easing of lockdown restrictions in EnglandA member of staff stands on Ai Weiwei\u0027s \u0027History of Bombs\u0027 during a photocall for the Chinese artist\u0027s new work on display at the Imperial War Museum in LondonStuart Broad celebrates after taking the wicket of West Indies batsman Kraigg Brathwaite.

In June a pharmaceutical industry memo said original stockpiles meant for no deal had been “used up entirely” and that it might not be possible to replenish them before December, when the UK is due to leave the single market.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBoris Johnson refused to extend the Brexit transition period last month despite disruption caused by coronavirus and the fact the UK is facing a cliff edge at the end of the year. Flagging trade talks mean it is increasingly likely that Britain will leave the single market without any trade agreement at all, with disruption to trade and supply chains expected.Why you shouldn’t lose any sleep over a no-deal BrexitNorthern Ireland customs rules not settled six months after Brexit“Holding additional stock in the UK provides a further buffer against some disruption and we believe, where it’s possible, it’s a valuable part of a robust contingency plan,” the letter, signed by Steve Oldfield, chief commercial officer at the department of health and social care, says.“We recognise that global supply chains are under significant pressure, exacerbated by recent events with Covid-19. However, we encourage companies to make stockpiling a key part of contingency plans, and ask industry, where possible, to stockpile to a target level of six weeks’ total stock on UK soil. DHSC stands ready to support companies with their plans if required and understands that a flexible approach to preparedness may be required that considers a mixture of stockpiling and rerouting plans as necessary.”But the memo reported earlier in the year from the pharmaceutical industry warned that there would be “less or zero product available in the market to allow for stockpiling a broad range of products” thanks to the pandemic.It continued: “We would warn against any drastic policies mandating wholesale changes to global supply chains, as this could fundamentally disrupt the supply of medicines for the NHS and patients in other countries.”Created with Sketch.Brexit celebrations in Parliament Square Show all 37Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Pro-Brexit supporters celebrating in Parliament Square, after the UK left the European Union on 31 January.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe researchers, from UCL and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that with increased levels of testing and effective contact tracing “an epidemic rebound might be prevented”.What are the UK lockdown rules now?How to ease yourself back into socialising once lockdown liftsThe new lost generationWhich countries are seeing a second wave of coronavirus?How to wear a face mask safelyHowever, they warned: “Reopening schools fully in September, alongside reopening workplaces in society, without an effective test, trace, isolating (TTI) strategy could result in a second wave of infections between two and 2.3 times the size of the original wave.”“Currently, TTI is not achieving the levels that we modelled. Looking at the NHS reports from the TTI system, it looks like it’s about 50 per cent coverage.”Dr Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths, a lecturer in mathematical modelling at the Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, UCL and lead author of the study, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that if test and trace is “not done effectively, then there is a risk of an occurrence of a second wave later this year”.Pressed on the study, Mr Clarke told Sky News: “It’s obviously vital that we always continue to keep up the progress that we’re making with test and trace, which is a massive national undertaking and it is working, I really would emphasise that.” The housing minister said over 184,000 people have so far been contacted by the NHS test and trace programme after a contact tested positive for the virus. He added: “Those people have been allowed to self-isolate, be removed from the community at a time where they could be at risk of spreading the virus and that’s obviously a massive success.

So this is a programme, which is delivering and which is helping to keep us all safer. There’s always more to do, we continue to work very hard to boost our testing capacity – we’re on track to deliver half a million be the end of October. “But one thing is clear: schools are going to reopen in full in autumn, that is not up for debate.”Speaking in the Commons after the decision to drop the target of returning all primary school children back to classrooms before the summer holidays, Boris Johnson said “primary and secondary education will recommence in September with full attendance”.No 10 yesterday reiterated the prime minister’s commitment, adding: “That’s vital for their education and development. We are planning for all pupils to return to school full-time from the beginning of the autumn term.”Schools reopening ‘risks second Covid-19 wave twice as big as first’Mr Clarke added: “There’s nothing gung-ho about getting schools back. There is little doubt about the major damage that it does to children’s education not to be in school. We’ve lost half a year now to this virus and some children’s education and it’s disrupted every child’s education.“It’s an absolute priority that we get on with this, it is a basic matter of social justice, there is a generation of children whose performance will be inhibited throughout the rest of their time in education unless we get this right and we’re confident that we can.”Speaking to Times Radio, former prime minister Tony Blair also urged the government to appoint a senior minister to be put in charge of testing, adding: “From the very beginning mass testing has been the only thing that gets you through this. “It allows you to avoid the severity of the very blunt instrument of lockdown and gets you to a place where you can more or less get your economy moving while you contain this disease.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Now make another cm cut that runs parallel to the bottom to make a rectangle that can be thrown away.Step four: Now, to make the ties that secure the mask you need two long strips of fabric. Then unfold the main piece of fabric and place over the mouth and nose to secure. This then needs to be tied around the head and around the neck.The government has ordered that people entering shops must now wear face masks - and those flouting the law in England could face a £ fine.The new mandatory measure came into force on Friday, July  as a way to stop people spreading the virus post-lockdown, with most businesses now reopen to the public - provided they are Covid-secure.Shopkeepers have been told to report lawbreaking customers to cops - but officers have warned it will be impossible to police.The new Covid- rule comes after ministers were criticised for contradicting each other on the need for masks.Boris Johnson said wearing a mask while shopping is a vital insurance policy to stop a second wave of coronavirus.The Government is asking people to wear a simple face covering, and not to buy up PPE standard medical masks as they are still needed for the NHS.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes. For further details of our complaints policy and to make a complaint please click here."},{"url":null,"title":"how make face mask mandatory rules","story":"The new rules, brought in on July , were introduced in a bid to battle the spread of coronavirus.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesBrits now have to wear face masks when entering shops - or face being fined.Face coverings are also mandatory on trains, buses, ferries, and aircraft to prevent a second peak of coronavirus in the UK.And while there are many good sources to bulk buy masks for a reasonable price, you can never beat a cost-cutting DIY expedition. Health officials have strongly urged the public not to buy up surgical masks, which are vital for frontline health workers to protect themselves while treating patients.Instead, Brits have been advised to try making their own at home version.Homemade masks wont offer the same protection as medical-grade masks, but experts say they still work to some level.One of the simplest ways to make one at home is to use paper you already have at home - just take two layers of kitchen roll and one tissue cut in half.You then cover each end with masking tape, punch two holes in and thread elastic or a hair tie through to fit around your ears.If you want to stfen it so that it is more secure you can add some wire into the ends before taping them up.Another method involves using a T-shirt without the need for any sewing or stitching.A YouTube tutorial by Runa Ray explains that for the t-shirt method, you need to cut out a in by in rectangle from the material.Then fold it in half and measure in on either side before making an equal number of cuts along the edges with scissors.Then turn the fabric inside out and knot each of the tails, but leave the four outer edges.Cut two more strips of material and tie them to the ends - these are the straps that will go around your ears.Some people have also used a vacuum cleaner bag to create a face mask, which is a bit more complicated - and only worksyou have a spare, clean bag to hand.The Government has also released \" href\"https:www.gov.uk government publications how-to-wear-and-make-a-cloth-face-covering how-to-wear-and-make-a-cloth-face-covering\" target\"_blank\" rel\"noreferrer noopener\"instructions on how to make a face mask from a T-shirt.You dont have to make your own homemade face mask to keep yourself safe. A face covering can be as simple as a scarf or bandana that ties behind the head.It should cover your mouth and nose while allowing you to breathe comfortably. Before putting your face mask on, wash your hands or use hand sanitiser and repeat after taking it off. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth at all times and store used face coverings in a plastic bag until you have an opportunity to wash them.Do not touch the front of the face covering, or the part of the face covering that has been in contact with your mouth and nose. Once removed, make sure you clean any surfaces the face covering has touched.You should wash a face covering regularly - it can go in with other laundry, using your normal detergent.The Government says that face coverings should not be used by children under the age of three or those who may find it dficult to manage them correctly.For example, primary age children unassisted, or those with respiratory conditions.Children should also only wear a face mask under the supervision of an adult.People with disabilites, breathing dficulties and children are exempt from wearing face masks in stores and on public transport. These people have been asked to download an exemption card from the TfL website so that they can show staff when asked about wearing a face covering.Experts are still pretty ided on their effectiveness outside of a medical setting.Wearing a mask can act as a physical barrier to prevent infecting othersyou are sick by blocking the droplets that come out when you cough or sneeze.The Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencies that is advising the government said the evidence that masks slow the spread is marginal but positive.But some experts argue that people can accidentally infect themselves when taking a mask off or they can lead to complacency with other measures such as hand-washing.As soon as you touch the mask having put it on it becomes redundant, some say.New evidence from Hong Kong about face masks has been shared confidentially with the World Health Organisation.The data hasnt been made public yet but it reportedly suggests that the protective gear was effective in slowing the spread in Asian countries.Professor Susan Michie, of University College London, said there is not good evidence to suggest wearing masks will cut transmissions.She said: They do not protect against the virus getting into the eyes - only close fitting goggles do this.People may not fit the masks properly or take them on and off. Touching face masks and not taking them off in the correct way may mean people contaminate their hands and spread the virus.People may have a  sense of reassurance and thus pay less attention to other behaviours key to reducing transmission such as social distancing and hand-washing.Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, reviewed  studies which looked at the efficacy of face masks in preventing respiratory illness.He said the research was poor, adding that it was as easy to make an argument for opposing the widespread use of masks as it would be to make an argument promoting their use.Most experts are in agreement that for masks to work as they are intended, they must be used correctly.Dr Jenna Macciochi, a lecturer in immunology at the University of Sussex, told the Mail: To be effective, a mask has to be fitted correctly, worn correctly and disposed of correctly — which is not something the general public has been trained in.She added that not wearing one correctly is potentially more hazardous than not using one at all, as you may infect yourself with the particles the mask is protecting you against when you take it off.The WHO says surgical masks can only help when used with other preventative measures such as frequent hand-washing.Face masks were made mandatory for people to wear on public transport from June  and people are now required to wear masks in shops, which came into force from July .On July , Matt Hancock confirmed it would be mandatory for people in England to wear face masks in shops.Anyone spotted flouting the new rules could be hit with a £ fine. Shopkeepers have been asked to implement the new rules in their stores.Passengers on public transport have already been told to wear masks when travelling, with commuters refused travelthey arent wearing oneTransport Secretary Grant Shapps has urged people to only wear face coverings - such as a scarf, piece of cloth or mask - and not surgical masks which should be reserved for health staff.Commuters should expect to see signs at stations and transport hubs outlining the new rules.Speaking on May , the UK Governments chief scientic adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said wearing face masks had a marginal but positive impact on the spread of infection.Where masks may have a role is where distancing isnt possible, where there might be undue crowding, he added.But Sir Patrick says wearing a mask should not replace social distancing and hand washing - which are both vital.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

suggests.The study led by researchers at Kings College London found that high levels of oestrogen may have a protective effect against coronavirus.Oestrogen, which declines in women post-menopause, interacts with the immune system in ious ways, including influencing how many immune cells are produced and how they respond to infection.Using data from the Covid Symptom Study App, researchers examined the rate of predicted Covid- among post-menopausal women, pre-menopausal women using the combined oral contraceptive pilland post-menopausal women taking hormone replacement therapy , from more than , women in the UK, between May  and June  .They hypothesised that oestrogen could serve as a protectant against Covid-.Coronavirus has depleted a fire service and wiped out  per cent of its

the bug on July ,  of their colleagues have been forced to self-isolate.It comes after a two day training exercise in which firefighters claim social distancing measures were not maintained, face masks were not worn during classroom learning sessions and water bottles and cooling measures were haphazardly shared between colleagues.The Fire Brigades Union says Surrey Fire and Rescue service #failed to properly implement vital health and safety measures# and did not adhere to #proper infection prevention and control measures# during the training.Weekly coronavirus deaths have fallen by

She has always been there in the background, just quietly getting on with it, with absolutely no fuss.Fuss, in fact, is clearly something that the royal has no time for as Anne was astonished to learn it takes Erin Doherty — the actress who plays her in the third series of The Crown — two hours to style her hair, as opposed to the “ten or  minutes” it takes Anne. I loved the portrayal of the young princess in the Netflix series: Down to earth, feisty and straightforward, which I suspect is accurate to a tee.I have always wondered whether the royals watch the drama and Princess Anne revealed she did and found it “quite interesting”.She was followed for more than a year by the filmmakers of Anne: The Princess Royal At , which also featured unseen family footage and interviews with her loved ones.I loved the stories from her children, Peter Phillips and Zara Tindall, describing how she wouldfrom royal s in her glamorous outfits and head straight to their farm to tend to the animals.Zara said: “She’d come home from engagements in exactly what she was wearing, make-up on, put her welly boots on, jacket on, do her chickens and get her eggs.”The appealing thing about Princess Anne is her work ethic and how happy she is to stay in the background.Her husband, Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence, said: “She’s not a person that is constantly looking for praise. She gets on and does her work regardless because she thinks it’s important.”So it came as no surprise when Anne declared in the documentary that she would not go on Twitter “evenyou paid me”.Princess Anne is not the only hard-working royal, of course.Her brother Prince Edward and his we Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, do loads of good work and are similarly modest in their approach.These members of the Royal Family are in stark contrast to Harry and Meghan, who claim that work is more important than anything , but rarely get on with it quietly.After all, Princess Anne does her job brilliantly, with no whinging or whining, and still remains out of the spotlight, which proves it can be done.Another appealing trait of Anne’s is her modesty about how hard she works. She has no intention of slowing down, despite being old enough to retire.She’s a credit to her family and the Queen — and the two of them clearly have a lot in common.I loved watching them interact and seeing that mother-daughter bond. You can see there’s real affection there. And what a great, dry sense of humour they both have.So it’s nice to watch something positive about the Royal Family these days.By simply being herself in the documentary, Princess Anne has generated more positive PR for the monarchy than it has had in a very long while.LOOKING at pictures of Gwyneth Paltrow on Instagram promoting a ready-to-drink brand of organic cocktails, I found myself thinking that no matter how much some people want to hate her, Gwyneth comes across as enviably wholesome, gorgeous, healthy . . . and probably a really nice person.The bottom line is that anyone who says they hate her is almost certainly just jealous.I AM so proud our national game has signed up to the Mentally Healthy Football Declaration, which urges young men – and men of all ages, in fact – to talk about their feelings, which is something males traditionally seem to struggle with.We can talk about the THEORY of mental health all we like but the power of role models, particularly for young guys, is immense.So it is lovely to see some footballing greats being open and honest about their own mental health – and the fact things haven’t always necessarily been rosy in the garden throughout their lives.Spearheaded by the Duke of Cambridge, the campaign is designed to make mental health a priority across all levels of football.So kudos to former England captain David Beckham, Aston Villa defender Tyrone Mings, Crystal Palace winger Andros Townsend and Manchester City and England skipper Steph Houghton for talking frankly about their own mental health and the state of play in football more generally.Beckham, in particular, yields great influence. Hearing him talk about the effects of being vilied and abused by fans after he was red-carded against Argentina in the  World Cup was very powerful.“When I look back on it now, I didn’t realise how hard it was,” he says. “The times I’ve faced adversity throughout my career – and ’ was by far the toughest – did I feel OK to go to someone and say I needed help  No. I felt I had to keep it all in and deal with it myself.“Now I’m preaching to my kids and to other kids that it’s really important to talk. It’s OK not to be OK and it’s OK to say that. It’s OK to come out and say, ‘I need help’.”Let’s hope young men everywhere take that on board and realise it’s good to talk.People with a negative outlook about the present or future die two years earlier than the average person, according to new research.According to the Aussie team that did the research, from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute in Brisbane, one reason for this might be that pessimists do not look after themselves as well, which has an impact on their health.The world is half-full of pessimists . . . or half-empty, depending on how you look at it. But the bottom line is that a positive mind and spirit equal positive outcomes, while a negative mind and spirit equal negative outcomes.So let’s all start looking on the bright side, shall we  Good. I am SO glad we had this chat.HEARING what it takes for models to look the way they do is always interesting.And by “interesting”, I mean it gives us a helpful reminder of how unrealistic expectations can be for women over their appearance.Brazilian model Vanusa Freitas,  – who clearly DOES look amazing – has shared the secret of how she looks the way she does.In preparation for a Playboy Portugal shoot, Vanusa exercised for eight hours a day and ate only egg whites.She said she was inspired by Kim Kardashian, which perhaps gave her the necessary discipline to deny herself food and, by the sound of things, time to do much  but work out.If spending the day in the gym and eating only egg whites is what is required to look like her, well . . . frankly, I’d rather have a le.Just reading the story made me feel sick.Roger Spackman, , was a Labour member of Exeter City Council until his arrest in  and worked at a secure children’s home.But the judge assessing his case this week decided Spackman would not himself commit abuse – so handed him only a suspended jail term.Yet the reality is that, by possessing these images, he is part of a cycle of horric abuse.Forty days of rehab is not going to change his desire to look at this kind of material.Time in prison would be a more fitting consequence – and perhaps some deterrent for the people who produce horric, disturbing images of children being harmed.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For more information about those sites, visit the government website.The government states: If you have coronavirus symptoms, you need to get a test done as soon as possible. You need to get the test done in the first  days of having symptoms.Book a visit to a test site to have the test today. Or order a home test kityou cannot get to a test site.On days  to , you can get tested at a site or at home. If you’re ordering a home test kit on day , do so by pm.On day , you need to go to a test site. It’s too late to order a home test kit.The government website states that you can get a test for yourselfyou have had Covid symptoms,someone you live with has symptoms,you have been told to take a test before surgery oryou work or study in an area where there has been an outbreak.The government tests are free.Made by Oxford Nanopore, the first the  minute test requires a saliva or nasal sample.From next week , of the LamPORE tests will be made available across adult care settings.A machine can process around , tests a day and a portable machine can also be moved to where pop up labs are needed in places that have seenan increase in cases.The Department for Health and Social Care said millions more tests would be rolled out later in the year.Health secretary Matt Hancock said this test would help break the chain of transmission.The second of the  minutes tests is an offering from a company that analyses people’s DNA from saliva in order to help them with their diets.DNAnudge uses nasal swabs and these tests are set to be rolled out from September.The company is supplying , boxes that process the tests - with a capacity of  a day.The aim is to provide . million tests in the next few months and this has already been trialled in eight London hospitals.At the moment, most labs use the PCR method for antigen testing.It can take days for labs to run the tests, meaning medics often cant tell patientsthey have the virus for  hours.Antigens are found on the surface of invading pathogens, including coronavirus.Testing for antigens can determine whether someone is currently carrying the virus and are actively infectious.The NHS is currently using antigen tests in hospitals to determinesomeone is currently infected with Covid-.Samples are taken using a swab - which resemble a large cotton bud - from deep inside the nose and throat before being sent off to a lab for testing.When a person gets infected with antigen, the body starts making specially designed proteins called antibodies in response - as a way to fight the infection.After they recover, those antibodies float in the blood for months, maybe even years.Thats the bodys way of defending itself in case it becomes infected with the virus again.So an antibody test specically looks for antibodies which will be able to tell whether youve already been exposed to Covid-.Anyone who has already had the illness is presumed to be immune to getting it again - at least, in the intermediate term.This would allow them to go back to work safe in the knowledge that they are unlikely to become infected again or pass the virus on.The check that has been developed for Covid- is a finger-prick blood test, with the samples sent to laboratories and results available within a few days.Dr Hilary Jones, a GP and resident doctor on Good Morning Britain, explained that it works almost like a pregnancy test, except you need a drop of blood.Last week it was also revealed that an £ test could be used to screen travellers going to Italy.The rapid diagnostic tests give results in just  minutes and could be given to every passenger who enters the country.The person being given the Standard Q Covid- test will be asked to use the nasal swab.If the sample provided contains Covid particles, the antibodies already included on the test will bind them and the swab will turn red to show that the person is infected.Last month Superdrug became the first store to offer coronavirus antibody blood tests.While we still dont have a vaccine for the coronavirus, testing is one way to stop the spread.Testing can allow local authorities to pick up trends in how the virus moves through a community.This also helps when it comes to implementing local lockdowns, as has been seen in places such as Leicester.According to the Gov.UK website, , coronavirus tests were carried out on Sunday, while almost . million tests have been carried out since the outbreak began.On April , the Government set a target of , tests a day by the end of the month.Last month it was revealed Boris Johnson failed to meet his target of having all coronavirus tests completed within  hours by the end of June.Statistics from the Department of Health and Social Care suggested that only  per cent of in-person tests were completed within the time frame between June  and July .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is hidden bullying, she said.The mother-of-one argued her Czech origins and the predominantly Polish background of the workforce was linked to historic tensions which influenced her experience at the factory. The former factory worker said she discovered excrement in her lunchbox and had her work shoes soaked in urine.She also said her coffee was spiked with laxatives forcing her to make several trips to the bathroom.Other incidents included finding alcohol planted in her locker and the claim that other workers had rummaged through her bag.Tribunal judge Tudor Garnon said that the culprit of the disgusting attacks remained a mystery.On one occasion, she claimed a Polish colleague Bogdan Piatek, , called her gypsy and made comments such as: Hey Czech, you’re here again  What do you want here  Don’t worry, you’re not going to be here long.She also claimed another colleague, Adam Cywinski, , made crude sexual jokes about the two of them and at one point inappropriately touched her breasts.The judge described Cywinski as obsessed with her in a fairly harmless, though persistent, way.He ruled that Ms Capandova was harassed while employed at Bfa, concluding: We accept somebody put excrement in her lunchbox, laxatives in her coffee, alcohol in her locker, urinated in her boots and went through her bag. These were the acts of a person, probably more than one person, which had a profound effect upon [Mrs Capandova] and understandably so. She cannot say, nor can we tell, who did it, still less why.The judge added that although her harassment claim was well-founded, Bfa could not be found liable to sex or race discrimination.

He says he remembers the date well because he took daughter Beatrice to a Pizza Express in Woking, Surrey.But Shukri has no doubts it was the Prince she saw dancing with teenage sex slave Virginia Giuffre at a nightclub — because she said sorry to him after standing on his foot.Shukri said she turned to apologise after her mishap on the dance floor at Tramp and found herself face-to-face with the Prince.She recalled: “He was smiling. He said, ‘No problem’.”Shukri’s account is another blow to the beleaguered royal, who has come under intense scrutiny since -year-old Maxwell was arrested last month for conspiring with Epstein to sex traffick women.Shukri today said she decided to speak out after watching Andrew’s denial during his now infamous Newsnight interview.She contacted US lawyer Lisa Bloom, who represents a number of Epstein’s victims. Ms Bloom passed the information on to the FBI.  Shukri said: “When I watched the BBC interview and saw Prince Andrew deny knowing Virginia, saying he has no recollection of that night I had to come forward.“Because I was there and I do have a recollection of it.”Shukri said that she and a male friend had been dancing in the club while Andrew was among a group sitting in a corner.She added: “I can remember exactly where they were sitting. “They had one of those coolers with ice and a bottle in. In fact probably two of those. “You could tell they were getting special treatment.“The man I was with went over there and started talking to them and then came back.“Then at some point I was dancing with him and stood on the feet of one of the men sitting in the corner and I said, ‘I’m sorry’.“And he was smiling. He said, ‘No problem’. My companion said that the man who I stood on was actually Prince Andrew.“I’d never seen a Prince in my le before. I just stood and looked at this man, thinking, ‘Oh my goodness. It’s a real Prince.’“He was smiling a lot, most of the night. “He looked like he was having a great time. And he was with this young girl who was close to my own age, perhaps even a bit younger than me.“They were not that alone. They were with the woman who has just been arrested, Ghislaine Maxwell, and Epstein. “I will never forget the night because I was told this is a real Prince. That’s the moment that stood out for me. I don’t think I would have remembered otherwise.”Shukri recalled Virginia had an “awkward expression” on her face.She added: “I do remember the little girl perhaps was a little bit drunk or just had a weird expression, an awkward expression.“But she wasn’t smiling, it was the opposite of smiles.”In Virginia’s account of the night of March , , Andrew was “sweating profusely” as they danced. Andrew told Newsnight that was impossible as he has a medical condition which means he does not sweat.Shukri says she cannot be sureAndrew was sweating — but claims she did see him wipe his face.She said: “He was using the back of his hand. I don’t know with all honestyhe was wiping it because he was sweating or just touching it.“But he wiped at his forehead with the back of his hand when he was dancing several times.“I remember he was dancing with the young girl and chatting with her throughout the night.”Virginia, now , says she was forced to have sex with Andrew at Maxwell’s London house. She says a picture of Andrew with his arm around her was taken there on the same night.Andrew has said he has no ­recollection of meeting Virginia and suggested the photo may have been faked. Maxwell is currently in jail in New York awaiting trial.Billionaire financier Epstein, a friend of Andrew’s, killed himself in prison a year ago while facing similar charges.Somalian Shukri said she was even more determined to come ­forward because she was a sex trafficking victim herself.She was a teenage refugee from her war-torn homeland when she was trafficked from Kenya to Italy and then London. Ms Bloom believes Shukri to be a credible witness. The lawyer said: “All she wanted was to get her story to the FBI as a witness to help Virginia.“So she wasn’t seeking any money from anyone. She wasn’t looking to bring a lawsuit.”The FBI decided it did not need Shukri’s testimony.Ms Bloom said: “They said, ‘We have the story, thank you. And we don’t need to bother her’.”The lawyer said a second woman had been in touch claiming to have seen Andrew and Virginia together in the club on that evening.She said she had several phone conversations with the witness, who was too frightened to go public. Ms Bloom hopes Shukri’s story will put further pressure on Andrew to speak to US prosecutors. She said: “Absolutely they should investigate him.“You know,it walks like a duck and talks like a duck, it’s probably a duck and this duck spent a lot of time with Epstein,“And Andrew’s story always seemed so shady to me.“He has not released any documents, calendars or journals that would show where he was.”Andrew was pictured in Tramp on March  — three days after it is claimed he was there with Virginia.He was snapped chatting to Fiona Sangster, we of racing tycoon Robert.Virginia claims she was groomed by Epstein and Maxwell after being invited to apply for a masseuse job shortly after her th birthday.She has alleged in court documents they made her have sex with Andrew in London, New York and the US Virgin Islands in .Last week more of her allegations were revealed during ongoing ­hearings related to the trafficking charges against Maxwell.David Boies, Virginia’s lawyer, told The Sun last night: “The more the evidence comes out, the more confirmation there is that the Epstein survivors are telling the truth, and that the denials and attacks of the Epstein enablers and participants are a smokescreen.”Buckingham Palace has previously described Virginia’s claims as “ and without any foundation”.It added: “Any suggestion of impropriety with under-age minors” by the Duke of York was “categorically untrue”.Andrew, , has not commented on Shukri’s claims.But a friend said: “It’s interesting to see how many people have razor sharp recollections of events that took place some  years ago.“It’s dficult to believe that these events can be remembered with such clarity at this distance.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In its place, he urged governments to continue with containment measures such as contact tracing, quarantining and mass testing.Dr Tedros said: The message to people and governments is clear: Do it all.A number of vaccines are now in phase three clinical trials and we all hope to have a number of effective vaccines that can help prevent people from infection.However, theres no silver bullet at the moment - and there might never be.He added: There are concerns that we may not have a vaccine that may work, or its protection could be for just a few months, not more.But until we finish the clinical trials, we will not know.The WHO head said that, while the coronavirus was the biggest health emergency since the early th century, the international scramble for a vaccine was also unprecedented.Some of the worlds largest economies are locked into the race for a vaccine, with the likely contenders hailing from Oxford University as well as US-based firm Moderna.Oxford scientists believe they have made a breakthrough in their quest for a vaccine after discovering that the jab triggers a response that offers a double defence against the virus.The  reported that phase one of the vaccine has shown that it generates an immune response against the disease.Imperial College, meanwhile, is also involved in two clinical trials testing a vaccine against Covid-, led by Professor Robin Shattock.But experts have reminded the public that, even when a vaccine shows promise, several stages of trials will be needed to confirm it is safe ahead of an international rollout - which is unlikely to be until . At the same briefing, the WHOs most senior epidemiologist said that officials believe that the infection kills .% of all patients.This makes the disease six times more deadly than seasonal flu. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHOs technical lead, said that the true fatality rate was dficult to measure due to the amount of unknown coronavirus patients.Dferent scientists have thus far provided dferent estimations of the mortality rate for Covid-, with academics from Cambridge University previously stating it could be as high as .%, the Mail reports.Dr Mike Ryan, executive director of WHOs Health Emergencies Programme, said that the estimate of .% meant just over one in  people infected, potentially dying. It comes as the pandemic accelerates in many parts of the globe, despite national lockdowns slowing the spread in most nations. The US has seen a dramatic surge in cases, recording a staggering , new infections yesterday with states such as Florida and Texas particularly hard-hit.Other countries with high transmission rates, such as Brazil and India, were also urged to reset by Dr Ryan as their governments struggle to bring infections down.

Were on track to deliver half a million by the end of October. But one thing is clear, schools are going to reopen in full in the autumn, that is not up for debate.The NHS contact tracing system must reach  per cent of cases and their contacts, the experts said, adding that the current system is not good enough. One of the study authors, Chris Bonell, professor of public health sociology at LSHTM, said: It looks from the ONS data like there are about , new infections per day.And it looks like from the testing data there are about , testing positive per week. So it looks like about one in seven . So, thats not good enough, basically.Under the current system, only half of contacts are reached and only a fraction of symptomatic cases are tested, according to researchers from University College London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.Without drastic improvements in testing the authors say it will be absolutely essential to introduce other measures in September to mitigate the effects of schools opening. Another study published out of Australia today suggested that schools could re-open safely but onlystrict rules and robust contact tracing were adhered to.The research looked at how Covid- spread in schools across NSW Australia, one of the only countries to keep schools open during the pandemic.The study, published today in The Lancet Child and Adolescent Health, found low levels of transmissions in schools and nurseries when control measures are in place.Dr Jasmina Panovska-Grfiths, study author, said: Our modelling suggests that with a highly effective test and trace strategy in place across the UK, it is possible for schools to reopen safely in September. However, without sufficient coverage of a test-trace-isolate strategy the UK risks a serious second epidemic peak either in December or February.Therefore, we urge the government to ensure that test-trace-isolate capacity is scaled up to a sufficient level before schools reopen. Commenting on the study, Matt Keeling, professor of populations and disease at University of Warwick, said: In essence the problem is simple.Reopening schools is going to increase the R number sowe are to keep R below  and prevent a second wave, some other forms of control are necessary.The reopening of schools should clearly be a key priority for the UK, many children will have gone over  months without setting foot in a classroom.The key questions are how much impact will school reopening have on the epidemic and what can be done to mitigate this.The study found a second wave could be preventeda robust testing and an adequate contact tracing system was in place.Professor Bonell said: Our study should not be used to keep schools shut because of a fear of a second wave but as a loud call to action to improve the infection control measures and test and trace system so we can get children back to school.He said: Were not giving specic recommendations about what sectors need to have restrictions imposed, but logically that is absolutely essential.Englands chief medical officer last week hinted pubs and restaurants may have to shut in order for schools to reopen fully in September.Professor Chris Whitty said getting children back into the classroom is pivotal for the “wellbeing of our country” - and hinted that Brits will have to sacrice other freedoms in order to do so.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were forced to ditch the name from their website and charity as party of their settlement with the Palace.Mr Harrold has reportedly argued the sitcom The Royle Family was allowed to be broadcast unchallenged.He also reportedly claims that a reference, confirming his appointment by Prince Charles as a royal butler, allows him to use the title.Representing The Crown, Mr Muir Wood argued that the picture of Mr Harrold with the waxwork might even mislead people into thinking it was the real Queen.He also dismissed Mr Harrold’s business partner Princess Katarina of Yugoslavia, the grand niece of Prince Philip, as not being a proper member of the Royal Family.Mr Harrold describes himself as a personal aide of Princess Katrina, who is also a patron of his business The Royal School of Butlers.The Crown fiercely protects who can and cannot use the word Royal and companies need special permission to include it in the name of a business.Speaking at an Intellectual Property office hearing on July , Mr Muir Wood said: We say it is possible that members of the public would believe he is educating butlers on behalf of The Queen at his Royal Butler School, that he was appearing in the media as her representative, as a representative of the household of her Royal Family.He also argued that no consent had been given from the monarch or the Cabinet Office for Mr Harrold to use the term Royal.Only those two authorities can give someone or a businesses permission to use the protected term.On his website, Mr Harrold describes The Royal Butler as a persona which he uses to teach people how to behave and act as ladies and gentlemen.He cites appearances on the Real Housewives of Cheshire and The Miss Holland Show as uses of this character on TV.A decision in Mr Harrolds case is expected to be made in the next six weeks.It came after Harry and Meghan agreed to drop their use of the word Royal after long discussions with The Queen as they quit the Royals in March.The pair revealed they had made private arrangements and announced their separation from the Royal Family will be reviewed after  months.On March , Sussex Royal spokesperson said: “As was agreed with The Royal Family, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will no longer use the name Sussex Royal for their charitable organisation, Instagram or website.“The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will spend the next few months focusing on their family and continuing to do what they can, safely and privately, to support and work with their pre-existing charitable commitments while developing their future non-profit organisation.“Following today’s post, The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will no longer post on Instagram under the @sussexroyal handle and will also no longer update SussexRoyal website.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And while the palace has not commented on the claims in the biography, Kate Middleton is said to have been left devastated by the allegations.Meanwhile, huge chunks of Meghans page on the official Royal Family website have been culled. In , after her marriage to Prince Harry, Meghan was granted multiple paragraphs on the official site detailing her time in North America and Canada prior to joining the Firm.They included Meghans famous quote from a United Nations conference in New York in  when she said: I am proud to be a woman and a feminist.But now the site omits all mention of this, although it does still reference her career in legal drama, Suits, and how she attended university in Illinois and ran lestyle blog The Tig.Her HRH was also removed.The couple themselves - who are now living in Tyler Perrys million Beverly Hills mansion - have now started to voice their opinions on issues, particularly on race and equality, since leaving the royal family.In the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement Meghan, who became the first mixed race person to marry a senior royal, delivered an impassioned speech to her old high school following the death of Mr Floyd, sharing her absolute devastation at racial isions.The issue of racial equality is expected to be a cause that forms part of their public work when the couple formally launch their new charitable organisation, Archewell, which has replaced their UK based Royal Sussex foundation which has been wound down.And Meghan is fighting legal actions on both sides of the Atlantic, suing Mail On Sunday and MailOnline publisher Associated Newspapers after articles were published last year featuring parts of a handwritten letter she sent to her estranged father.And the Sussexes began court proceedings in July in Los Angeles after drones were allegedly used to take pictures of their young son Archie.From March , Harry and Meghan stopped using their HRH styles and ceased to be senior working royals, in favour of being able to earn money.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Tory donors made up the largest group - with  party backers having been handed peerages during this period.Billionaire businessman Michael Spencer became the latest wealthy donor to be ennobled on Friday, as Boris Johnson was accused of cronyism for stuffing the Lords with  new Tory peers, including his own brother Jo Johnson.Downing Street insisted that the Prime Minister believes that the Lords should be shrunk in size - despite nominating  people in total, including Labour and non-affiliated peers.But Mr Johnson was accused of u-turning on promises to slim down the upper chamber and swelling its ranks with cronies. Analysis of the biggest donors over the past  years by the Financial Times found  donors had been made peers, donating some £.m to the main three parties either personally or through their related companies. peers were created in the period, of which  were Tory donors, three were Labour benefactors and four were Liberal Democrats.The majority of the cash came from Tory backing businessmen, including £.m from Stanley Fink, £.m from Anthony Bamford, £.m from Michael Farmer, £.m from James Lupton, £.m from Alexander Fraser and £m from David Brownlow. Mr Spencer, a former Conservative treasurer, has donated some £m to the party’s coffers through his investment firm IPGL, the paper said.  Darren Hughes, chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said: “Pressure is mounting for an overhaul of the Lords, after this shocking batch of cronyistic appointments. “Even the Lord Speaker recognises that this situation is untenable and has completely over-ridden even the Lords’ modest attempts at self-regulation. “At over  members, this bloated chamber is making a mockery of democracy.” It comes after Lord Speaker Norman Fowler criticised the number of new appointments and said the move encouraged peers who were “quite frankly passengers”. Downing Street said new peers were needed to ensure the “appropriate expertise” but refused to comment on inidual appointments, such as former cricketer Ian Botham and Russian-born newspaper owner Evgeny Lebedev."},{"url":null,"title":"eat out help out rishi","story":"NewsopinionEat Out to Help Out  Dont mindyou do, RishiState subsidies for junk food wont end the pandemic or save the hospitality sector, says Fleet Street Fox.

Rishi Sunak reveals a plan to give discounts for food. Great, grin all the Tories, for whom aposSoviet-style state food subsidiesapos is a phrase they utter only at election time, and about someone . What are we going to call it Um, says Rishi. We tried New Deal Meals, but itaposs a bit clumsy. We tried Meal Deal, but apparently thataposs been taken. Boris said I couldnapost have Rishiaposs Dishes. So after checking it couldnapost possibly refer to anything , weaposve decided to go with Eat Out to Help Out.Oh, thataposs catchy, say the Cabinet, for whom the concept of oral pleasure is linked firmly to Jacob Rees-Mogg saying sesquipedalian gobbledegook in a Brexit debate. And so here we are, in a topsy-turvy world in which a government of gammon are encouraging people to be, shall we say, signicantly kinder to their ladies than any of us imagine the Cabinet might ever have been.Little do these men, who have given so few gts for so long, realise it, but were anyone to follow their latest instruction to the letter it might actually ease the pandemic a bit. Some researchers have claimed that oral sex can improve levels of stress-reducing oxytocin, as well as dehydroepiandrosterone or DHEA, which is used to make sex hormones and can boost the immune system. Both might have some impact on heart disease and some cancers, too, which means you really can Eat Out, Protect the NHS, And Save Lives. These hormones usually peak in our s, so encouraging their production in middle or later years certainly wouldnapost hurt. Perhaps it would even convince some of the over-s angry about their suggested quarantine that it has its benefits. But wait. What am I saying  As soon as anything that might help the ladies is suggested, a man is bound to point out vaginas cause mouth cancer, and claim itaposs just another way of finishing off the male race.They wonapost care that the risk is tiny, increased a lot by smoking, and penises can pass on cancer-causing STIs too. Donapost letaposs interrupt their important business of talking themselves out of having more, or indeed any, sex.  Because more than anything , the act of giving can only improve those who, much like the Cabinet, have never given much of anything. Itaposs called the aposHelperaposs Highapos - a natural reward system hard-wired into our brains. Acts of kindness, compassion and altruism create a burst of endorphins that lower stress levels, improve self-worth and mental health, and have proven over time to even increase lespan. Itaposs an evolutionary tweak that ensures the survival of those who help others, and thereby improve their own lives too.You donapost get that bump just by going to work, having a child, or coming up with a £bn test and trace system that only half works. Itaposs no good, for example, to eventually come round to the idea of wearing a mask, or to order people to eat in a restaurant and consider youaposve done your bit for society.The endorphins donapost comeyou call it a muzzle, advise people to just get sick and stop moaning, or put your mateaposs right to make millions over the rights of millions not to die before their time. Those people may be rich, or in positions of power, but they all suffer endorphin poverty, and theyaposre easy to spot.  According to the government website which tells me where, in the nearest  miles, my meals will be discounted, Rishi will pay for part of my food at two local pubs, the second-best Indian takeaway, a truck stop greasy spoon, a farmshop, a garden centre cafe, and a winery.But seeing as his boss is busily telling us Covid- is having a resurgence, and itaposs still an incurable disease, Iaposll probably pass. A tenner off in any of those places does nothing to reduce whatever risk there is, and will probably increase my taxes in the years to come by hundreds every year. Unless everyone does it, staff will still get laid off. The sums donapost really add up. But letaposs be honest - Rishiaposs dishes are no more about helping minimum-wage waiters than they are about making himself look, well, giving. Every pound he promises sends his popularity soaring in inverse proportion to that of Boris Johnson, whose negative ratings plummet further with his every pronouncement. Neither of them are feeling the Helperaposs High. Those in government seemed to have framed the pandemic in terms only of what it can get them - closer to power, contracts for contacts, or a buff to the reputation.Making coronavirus about the inidual is the best way of letting it win. Saying masks are optional, because they wonapost be enforced, or that a corporate raideraposs right to a idend trumps that of others to reduce their risk, puts one person above others. And with this disease, the normal hierarchy is reversed - the poorest and sickest are at the front of the queue.The only response to that is collective. Because everyone  is in the queue, too, and when the poorest and sickest are gone itaposll be the less poor, and less sick, next time.

Alun Elder-Brown, who is registered blind, captured the incident after the owner ed to his vehicle having apparently left his pet in the sweltering heat. Temperatures in Normanaposs Bay, East Sussex, reached  degrees last Wednesday, prompting concern from a group of bystanders who spotted the dog barking from inside the car. The video begins with Alun and the group expressing concern for the animal, they say has been left in  degree heat. Eventually, the dogaposs owner s to the vehicle and a woman begins shouting: Is this your dog  Get it taken home before I ring the police. Itaposs been there for two hours. Bloody ridiculous. The woman keeps shouting, while the man pays her no attention. She accuses him of cruelty, but the man insists he has been ing to his vehicle to check on the dog.  He becomes more angry as the accusations continue, before suddenly launching a kick at Alun as he films. He then pushes the woman away as she keeps telling him to get the dog out of the car. Eventually he removes the dog from the car and Alun explains to the man that he is registered blind. At this point, more people appear telling him to f off and he fills up a dish with water for the dog.  The parched pooch is then seen lapping up the water, before his owner takes him with him back to the pub. Alun says he has reported the man under the Animal Welfare Act , but chose not to pursue an assault charge. He shared the video on Facebook, saying: Dog left for an hour and a half in a pub car park in soaring heat. The owner, who has been reported to the police under the Animal Welfare Act , then assaulted me.  The police were called, not by me but a lady bystander. The policewoman informed me he would most definitely be reported for the crime of animal cruelty, though I am not pursing the assault.  Note: I only showed up towards the later stages of this situation.

Boris Johnson and ministers were said to be mulling over advising millions of older people to isolate as cases continue to surge, as one of a number of possibilities.But critics had said the controversial idea failed to take into account the importance of that age bracket in terms of the countryaposs workforce - while also being discriminatory. For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HEREInstead, they pointed the government in the direction of rule-flouting youths, who they said need to be more effectively forced to social distance and avoiding mass gatherings.  It comes after photos showed younger people continuously breaching restrictions during the heatwave over the weekend.Former Labour government adviser Baroness Joan Bakewell, , told the Daily Mail : Young people assume it is over and are not distancing themselves as they should. They know they should, they have been told they should, but they cannot be bothered. That is the crux. Ex-Conservative minister Ros Altmann said: What weaposre talking about here is a group in society that is being potentially singled out for dferent treatment just on the basis of their age. While Labour peer Lord Foulkes said: It is both ageist and ill-thought-out. Some under-s have underlying health conditions, while some over s are key to our economy.The plan would have reportedly seen people aged between  and  a personalised risk rating advising them whether to shield. It would mean that people could be forced to shield because of their age in coming months - and vulnerable people identied in March would once again be made to isolate themselves.It was being weighed up as one of a string of alternatives to reimposing full nationwide lockdown restrictions, as happened in March, it is claimed.Tory minister Robert Jenrick has, however, insisted the idea was not being actively considered and said it was speculation. No sources also called the reports speculative.

Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham yesterday warned the “R Rate” in the North West may be above one, meaning the infection is spreading. He tweeted: “North West at .. Underlines the need for caution and to follow the guidance.” Infection rates, the number of cases per , people, rose in eight of the  Manchester boroughs last week. In Stockport, it rose from . to ., with  new cases. In Bury, it rose from . to ., with  new cases. In ­Tameside, it was up from . to ., with  new cases. In Rochdale and Wigan, infection rates fell. Yesterday, as Manchester was coming to terms with a “major incident” being declared, the Government confirmed more areas could be locked down and travel bannedcoronavirus cases rise. Lockdown restrictions were re-imposed in parts of the North West and West Yorkshire last Friday, banning people from visiting the homes and gardens of friends and neighbours. But bars and restaurants have been busy in the city in recent days. And there are fears that soaring temperatures later this week will lead to large gatherings. Downing Street has confirmed travel in and out of towns and cities, including London, could be banned to stop spikes.  A spokesman said “closing down local transport networks” was one of the measures in the “contain strategy”an area was “particularly badly affected”. He said: “We have informed the public and politicians of that being a potential action we could take. It is not something specic to London. It would be because there has been a specic outbreak in a town, city or localised areas.” It could mean banning people living in the capital from going outside the M. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has written to PM Boris Johnson to voice “great surprise” at suggestions of a ­quarantine zone within the M.  Mr Khan complained it had been  weeks since he had been invited to a COBRA meeting, and he branded the lack of consultation “unacceptable”.Local government leaders in Gtr Manchester, who declared a major incident on Sunday after a rise in infection rates, have told the public there is no need to panic. Sir Richard Leese, Manchester City Council leader, said it was “standard practice for complex situations”.He said: “People should not be alarmed.”But it opens the door to the Army being drafted in to support the police and other emergency services.Former Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police, Sir Peter Fahy, said: “Normally a major incident is declared when there is a terrorist attack or extreme weather.  “It means there is one command centre, all the key people are working together in the same room. But it does show how serious agencies in Greater Manchester are viewing this situation.” Last month, a major incident was declared in Bournemouth when thousands of people packed on to beaches. And with temperatures set to hit C and above later this week, Sir Peter said: “The biggest concern for the police will be about public gatherings.” In Liverpool, public health officials hope to deal with an increase in cases in the Princes Park area without additional lockdown measures. A walk-in test centre was installed in the area on Saturday and anyone shielding is being asked to continue to shield until August . Volunteers are going door to door to raise awareness of testing availability.

Deals have been struck in England, Wales and Northern Ireland with Vertex Pharmaceuticals in recent weeks to make the triple gene therapy drug available for patients there as soon as the European Commission grants a licence. The Scottish Government is expected to secure its own deal in the near future – but Hailey says she needs the drug now to save her le. An application was made by hospital medics at to drug firm Vertex prior to the pandemic. But she is still waiting seven months on, due to what she describes as “red tape and bureaucracy”. She said: “In January, I felt like I was getting somewhere, then Covid happened and I feel like since then it has just been excuses. “Last week, a doctor told me they were very worried about me and I need to think about whether I want to pass away in hospital or at home. “I felt like they were giving up on the Kaftrio and weren’t fighting to get it any more. I’ve been assured they are but I just don’t feel the urgency. I need this drug now. Not next week, not next month.”  Cystic fibrosis is an inherited condition in which the lungs and digestive system can become clogged with thick mucus. Hailey, who ran her own hairdressing business until January, had managed to keep her condition relatively stable until about a year ago. Her best chance of survival is a double lung transplant, but the complexities of the condition mean she has struggled to maintain enough weight to allow her to have the procedure. She receives daily treatment at home in Westhill, including oxygen, intra­venous therapy and anti­biotics. But she says lockdown has caused a decline in her condition, which could prove fatal at any time. Health experts say nine in  people with the genetic condition could benefit from Kaftrio – known as Trikafta in the US. The therapy combines three drugs to tackle the underlying causes of the disease, by helping the lungs work effectively.

Claudia Ruf was kidnapped from Grevenbroich, Germany, in , while walking her neighbouraposs dog. Her partly burned body was found around  miles from the town. Police investigating the possible involvement of prime Maddie suspect Brueckner today ruled him out as a suspect. A police spokesman told German newspaper Bild: After comparing the information obtained, it can be said that Christian B was not in Grevenbroich at the time in the case of Claudia Ruf. In addition, a DNA comparison is said to have been negative. DNA tests were carried out on hundreds of men in the German town last year in a desperate hope for a lead in the case.  It is likely to take until the end of this year to complete screenings on the , samples. German prosecutors believe Brueckner, , is the man responsible for the disappearance of Madeline McCann in . They say a phone belonging to the career criminal was allegedly used in the vicinity of the Portugal resort at the time of her disappearance. But Fulscher - who was hired by Brueckner two months ago - says he is is yet to be presented with evidence of the phone call by detectives.  He also claimed that evenit was made by Brueckner it doesnapost prove he is guilty. You canapost say because of the fact that this cell phone was logged to this tower that he was standing near to the apartment of Madeleine McCannaposs disappearance, Mr Fulscher told News. He could have been  kilometres away.  He added: The media has described my client as a monster, when we speak he is very calm and friendly. Dozens of officers descended on an allotment Brueckner used to rent in Hanover on Tuesday where they conducted a major search.

During her short stint in the royal family, Meghan became known for her messy bun - a very dferent look than we were used to seeing from members of The Firm. While she often did her own hair and make up, hairdresser George Northwood was by her side during her time in the royal spotlight - and heaposs now given his thoughts on her new do. He believes her new hair is a her making a statement about how sheaposs started a new chapter in her le - and highlights that she no longer has to follow protocol. He told the : Sheaposs making a statement with hair that long - it represents strength and a sense that sheaposs really got everything sorted. This straighter, longer hairstyle marks a new chapter in her le without such strict protocols. While many people believe sheaposs had extensions put in, George says that isnapost the case and says itaposs all her real hair. Reflecting back on his time working with Meghan, he says they knew royal le meant things needed to be structured but they wanted something as relaxed as possible. He said: We decided to create a more undone look to balance out the formal dress code, often including soft tendrils that ultimately became her signature messy bun.  Whereas now, she can take a more relaxed approach to how she dresses, therefore this sleeker blow-dried hairstyle works beautully - itaposs casual but still polished and appropriate for her new le. Many royal fans believe her speech to the Girl Up  Leadership Summit also included several digs at her royal in-laws. In her pre-recorded message, which she filmed at her new LA home, where she has spent lockdown with Prince Harry and Archie, she referenced the treatment by “those in the corridors of power”. The -year-old said: I want to share something with you. “It’s that those in the halls and corridors and places of power, from lawmakers and world leaders to executives, all of those people, they depend on you more than you will ever depend on them. “And here’s the thing: they know this. “They know that all of you, at a younger age than any modern comparison, are setting the tone for an equitable humanity.

But before taking over the official royal account, Meghan had a page of her own - and it was very, very dferent. She filled her page with holiday snaps, bed selfies and cheeky jokes about her sex le. Like most fun-loving young women, Meghan regularly shared photos of her out and about with pals or enjoying some RR on trips to some of the most beautul parts of the world. There are also some very cheeky posts on her page, and weaposre not sure how the Queen would feel about them... Meghan used to love sharing photos of her dogs, and regularly posted snaps of her rescues - Guy and Bogart. She posted photos of her Canadian home, including some shots of her relaxing in bed.  And others are just general, very Instagram-friendly, snaps of her day-to-day live - and they all look a lot of fun. Self-confessed foodie Meghan also shared snaps of some of the delicious meals she tucked into - and the odd bottle of red wine, which she loves. She also shared a number of pictures which would, looking back, prove to have been a huge hint of her romance with Prince Harry long before they told the world they were in love. For Halloween, she shared a snap of her holding up a huge pumpkin while wearing an oversize cardigan.Itaposs believed Harry was visiting her when the snap was taken, and itaposs likely that he was behind the camera.  She also shared photos of her with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in which sheaposs wearing a blue and white beaded bracelet. This would later link her to Harry, who was spotted wearing a matching piece at an engagement around the same time. Meghanaposs blog The Tig was also hugely popular with fans, writing about everything from food and travel to her experiences of racism. Bizarrely, she also wrote her future sister-in-law, years before they even met.Like everyone  in the world, Meghan couldnapost escape royal wedding fever and back in  - three years after the Duke and Duchess of Camdbridgeaposs wedding - Meghan waded in to talk about princesses.She had a few things to say about grown womenaposs obsession with princesses.  In an interview with Princess Alia Al-Senussi, a descendant of Libyan royalty, in  she spoke about how society views princesses, reports Glamour magazine.She wrote: Little girls dream of being princesses. I, for one, was all about She-Ra, Princess of Power. For those of you unfamiliar with the aposs cartoon reference, She-Ra is the twin sister of He-Man, and a sword-wielding royal rebel known for her strength. Weaposre definitely not talking about Cinderella here.

Holly Blake went to AE with breathlessness and a persistent pain in her leg, but an x-ray revealed she had metastasised cancer in her lungs, which had already spread throughout her body. The -year-old, from Edinburgh, has given up her job as a digital facilitator as she undergoes her third round of chemotherapy at the city’s Western General Hospital. After an ineffective second round of chemotherapy, Holly was told she has a ‘maximum of six months’ to live. Holly, who had no health issues before her devastating diagnosis, said: “We had no idea and I had no symptoms. “I thought I had a blood clot in my leg and I got sent for an x-ray, then they found my lungs were full of metastasised cancer. “It’s small blue cell sarcoma. It’s a rare kind of sarcoma that’s spread through my lymph nodes to my calves. “By the end of that week we knew the full picture. “I’m in hospital just now finishing my third round of chemo. “Unfortunately the last round wasn’t effective. “If this doesn’t work I’m looking at a few months to live - or maximum six months. “Either way my prognosis isn’t great, it’s stage four. This is management, rather than get rid of it. It was just total shock and disbelief. “It was the absolute last thing I would’ve expected. I’ve not had any health or lung problems. I don’t drink either.”  Holly’s family have rallied round to support her and help look after her six children - Eli, , Poppy , twins Daisy and Pippa, ten, and her youngest twins Edward and Primrose, two. She added: My family are just in bits. I have six young children and my youngest twins will be three next month. How do you get your head around that - it’s le changing stuff. “Everybody’s been amazing. I’ve had so much support and everybody’s pulled together. “My little two have a dferent dad and he’s looking after them by himself and has given up his job. I hope to do some nice things with the kids before I die.” Holly is hoping to hear in the next few daysher third round of chemotherapy has been successful.

Lawyers acting on behalf of The Crown argue that the business name along with a golden crest on a website belonging to Grant Harrold, who worked for Prince Charles from  until , are misleading the public into believing he still has an official job working for the Royal Household.The row comes after the -year-old monarch in February banned Prince Harry and his we Meghan from using the brand Sussex Royal in a bid to build a new le and make a fortune following their dramatic resignation from The Firm.Mr Harrold, a regular guest on popular TV shows This Morning and Good Morning Britain where he hands out etiquette advice, has argued the sitcom The Royle Family was allowed to broadcast unchallenged despite its dferent spelling. The former palace staffer also claims a reference, confirming his appointment by His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales as a royal butler, allows him to use the label. A royal source said: “The result of this case will be very interesting. Mr Harrold has been marketing himself as such for a good few years without an issue. “One does wonder whether this has more to do with the Queen’s grandson and his we having their wings clipped so a point of order must be made.”  Mr Muir Wood, acting on behalf of the Queen, said the public would also be misled by Harrold’s pictures of him posing next to a waxwork of Her Majesty at Madame Tussauds and that some would not even be able to tell the dference between the model and the real thing.

The system is said to be reaching only around % of contacts and a spike will hit in December without improvement. Schools opening in September may fuel the crisis. Scientist Professor Chris Bonell said Test and Trace “is not good enough basically”. He added: “We’re suggesting schools have to go back in September. It’s so critically important for the economy but also for children’s educational wellbeing. “Our study should not be used to keep schools shut over a fear of a second wave but as a call to action to improve the infection control measures and test and trace. The damning verdict on the Government’s flawed testing system came in a paper from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, where Prof Bonell works, and University College London. Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog here Modelling found NHS Test and Trace, staffed largely by outsourcing firms such as Serco, should be reaching at least % of contacts to avoid a deadly second Covid- wave. The study found the wave could be . times bigger than the first in a worst case scenario. Andthings do not improve, that means we could be heading for a second national lockdown. But just one in seven people with virus symptoms are coming forward to get tested and be entered on to the contact-tracing system.  Shadow Health Secretary Jon Ashworth said: “ Boris Johnson promised us a world-beating test and trace system. Instead the system isn’t tracing enough people.” Prof Bonell said public confidence may have been hit by Dominic Cummings breaching lockdown rules and driving from London to Durham with signs of coronavirus. He added: “This really requires that the population has trust in the system which may not always be the case at the moment in the aftermath of Dominic Cummings.  “A key factor that has to be considered is the proportion of those who are told to isolate, are actually isolating.” NHS Test and Trace has no data on how many of those contacted follow rules as it does not carry out follow-up calls. Modellers estimate % of staff willto their workplaces once schools are reopened, solving childcare problems.

Ten hotel workers at the Iberostar Club Cala Barca near Porto Petro have tested positive for coronavirus, along with four of their relatives. No tourists staying at the hotel have tested positive. The four-star hotel is the first in Majorca to close because of the Covid- pandemic. Hotel chiefs said they were taking the decision for reasons of “caution and responsibility.” Nearly  tests have been carried out on staff after news of the outbreak emerged last Thursday. More than  tests were due to take place on Monday. Tests on holidaymakers were ruled out following expert advice on the basis that none had come into close contact with an infected person for anyof time without a face mask on. Now holidaymakers will be offered rooms at the Iberostar Albufera Park in Playa de Muro,  miles north instead. The hotel is set to open on Friday. Last week,  Spanish tourists were quarantined at the Morlans Garden Hotel in Peguera near Magaluf in the south-west of Majorca. The group had been staying at a holiday home on the island and were set to fly back to Madrid. But one of them tested positive for coronavirus after a close contact in the Spanish capital had been diagnosed and their contacts traced,  At the time health chiefs said they were still awaiting results of tests on the other nine holidaymakers but said none were showing symptoms of the virus.Majorca is one of the Spanish holiday destinations fighting for ‘safe’ air corridor status with the UK following Boris Johnson ’s shock quarantine decision affecting ing British holidaymakers. Spain now has , active coronavirus infections - with , recorded on Friday, the biggest jump since the country ended lockdown.Yesterday, Spain’s tourism minister Reyes Maroto has claimed the UK government would lt its quarantine on travellers ing from the Balearic and Canary islands that day.

Speaking to News, agriculture officials said: Invasive species wreak havoc on the environment, displace or destroy native plants and insects and severely damage crops.Have you received the seeds  Email  webnews@mirrorTaking steps to prevent their introduction is the most effective method of reducing both the risk of invasive species infestations and the cost to control and mitigate those infestations.And, in a terrying warning given the current global context, the Texas Department of Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller warned the seeds could be a bacteria. He told CBS DFW: It could be another virus, some kind of invasive species. The US Department of Agriculture is understood to have identied some of the species of plant contained in seed bags being received by Americans. Amid warnings that the seeds could contain invasive species, the deputy administrator Osama El-Lissy of the departmentaposs Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service reported that the seeds included - - mustard - cabbage - morning glory - hibiscus - roses Also herbs like - - mint - sage - rosemary - lavender El-Lissy reported at least  of the seed species had been identied as of July .reader Liz Rhodes told us: I was given some of these by a friend, so I sowed them and they have come up beautully and flowered.  They seem to be courgettes or marrows and I have about six healthy plants in large pots.  For context, the Commonwealth nation of Australia is famously obsessive about blocking invasive species of plants, animals and bacteria from disrupting the balanced ecology of the country. An example of an invasive species of plant which has wreaked havoc in the UK would be Japanese knotweed, which can damage concrete foundations, buildings, flood defences, roads, paving, retaining walls and architectural sites. Meanwhile, grey squirrels are a notorious invasive species of animal, which has decimated Britainaposs native population of red squirrels. People around the globe are receiving the strange packets of seeds in the post without any explanation as to who they come from or why theyaposve been sent.  All that is known is the parcels come from China and people in the US and UK have reported receiving them totally out of the blue. There was explanation as to why people were getting these packages but they usually have Chinese writing on and are labelled as containing jewellery, possibly to avoid security checks. All  states in the US have sent out warnings against them in case they are dangerous. The problem has been quite prolic, with  reports in Florida alone. People are being warned not to plant the seeds, as those from from other parts of the world could damage local crops.  Robin Pruisner of the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship in Iowa, said she had received reports of seeds coated in a potential insecticide or fungicide. She said: Iaposve had people describe to me that the seeds are coated with something purple. I havenapost had it in my hands yet, but it sounds an awful lot like a seed treatment. Areader told us: I, a few days ago, received a similar packet. This made me think, particularly the description, aposStud earringapos. Putting my thinking cap on I remembered I had ordered many months ago - aposwhite button mushroom seedsapos - by which I presume they meant mushroom spawn from an Amazon UK seller.  I  had completely forgotten the order until this package arrived, obviously labelled aposStud earringapos to get through Customs. In the circumstances I will  not chance planting the seeds but will put them on the fire. In the US, the Iowa Agriculture Department has told the public the mysterious packages are likely part of a brushing scam. This involves a seller sending products which to people who have not requested them The seller then places fake customer reviews onto buying sites, such as Amazon, in order to drive sales.  The US Department of Agriculture said: Brushing scams involving seed packets in international mail shipments are not uncommon. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has intercepted similar seed shipments in recent years. Meanwhile, Phylissia Clark of the Better Business Bureau told CBS DFW that victims of aposbrushingapos that their identity has been compromised. She said: Somebody knows enough about you to create a profile online and use you to manipulate systems. At a rough count, at least   households in England have received the packages which have turned up in several European countries.

The duo were ejected from a Delta flight after they failed to follow the strict rule requiring travellers to cover their face at all times. The plane was set to fly to Atlanta, but the departure was delayed before it could leave DetroitAirport. A spokeswoman said: “Flight  from Detroit to Atlanta ed to the gate following two customers who were non-compliant with crew instructions.” “After a short delay, the aircraft departed to Atlanta.” Delta has introduced strict measures designed to curb the spread of coronavirus while flying.Last month, it said travellers who cannot wear a face mask for health reasons must undergo a medical screening before flying. And it said it encouraged people to reconsider travelthey cannot wear a mask - as the pandemic continues. The airlineaposs website states: “Delta customers and employees are required to wear a face mask, or appropriate cloth face covering over their nose and mouth throughout their travel, aligning with best practice guidelines from the CDC. “Plastic face shields may be used in addition to a mask but are not approved mask replacements. “Any mask with an exhaust valve is not approved as an acceptable face mask for customers traveling on any Delta operated flight.” Face coverings have become mandatory for most travellers globally, with all major UK airlines asking people to cover their face. In countries such as Spain, it is also illegal to not wear a face mask while on public transport for anyone over the age of six years old. Since June , face coverings have been required while using public transport in England. On July , Delta CEO Ed Bastian said passengers who refused to wear masks would be banned from flying with the airline. He said: You cannot board a Delta plane unless you have a mask on. If you board the plane and you insist on not wearing your mask, we will insist that you donapost fly Delta in the future. We already have over  people weaposve put on that list.  On August , Delta announced it was restarting its flagship route between London and New York. Capacity has been reduced and the airline has blocked off all middle seats on flights to ensure social distancing rules can be followed.

The players will know that. We were a wee bit loose when the ball got turned over and we get punished for that.”Mellon, having been round the course plenty of times both on and off the pitch in England, is shrewd enough a manager to know singling out “loose” players at this early stage of his tenure at Tannadice will do him no favours.Especially when, on Saturday, Lawrence Shankland was particularly worthy of the tag.United’s talisman was uncharacteristically quiet in the first half against Saints.Perth captain Jason Kerr was tasked with sticking to Shankland like glue and did so effectively, limiting the Tannadice hit man to a bit part in the game before the break.However, with United a goal and a man up after Michael O’Halloran’s sending off, last season’s top scorer emerged for the second half looking determined to make an impact in front of goal.Shankland’s keenness to open his top flight account was clear to see.Instead, after fluffing a couple of chances, the striker appeared to tire  minutes in and, with Saints in possession, clearly gave up on chasing possession from Saints’ Ali McCann, despite his manager’s audible encouragement from the technical area.With Shankland out of gas, McCann, unchallenged, found Kerr, who then found Danny McNamara, whose cross led to the botched Mark Connolly clearance lashed home by Liam Craig for the short-handed Perth side’s equaliser.Instructions were given by Micky Mellon. Instructions weren’t followed. A goal was coughed up.At this level – even against a weakened side – such things can be decisive.“Credit to St Johnstone, they dug in with  men and then we have to go and break down a block,” said the United boss.“We kept prodding and poking away at it but we just weren’t able to undo a packed block.“But we will learn our lessons and move on. That’s what it’s about, we are in a transition, we have moved up a ision.“There are a lot of players who are playing at this level again for the first time in a long time or playing for the first time, as well as having a -year-oldmaking his debut.“We will gather the positives and move on to training next week and be ready to move the club on again.”Victorious teams never talk about taking – or gathering – the positives from games.Instead, it tends to be a phrase beaten managers and players use to deflect from negatives.United weren’t beaten on Saturday but, at full time, a draw didn’t feel like a good result.Having played against  men for a full half, that’s understandable.But as the dust settles, the clearer it should become that there are plenty of reasons to be cheerful for the Tangerines.From kick-off until half time, United looked like a serious Premiership side. They were first to every ball. They were sharp, drilled and positive.Their movement was like clockwork. Their shape was well defined. They knew exactly what they were doing.There were issues – Shankland was far too quiet for somebody so potentially influential, while their second half performance was poor.But, as Micky Mellon said, it’s all about detail.The fact United fans can look at their side and say there are fine margins between the point they won on day one and the three they will be looking for next weekend against Motherwell ought to be heartening.The Tangerines, as a club, are back where they belong.If they can replicate their first half performance against Saints, they’ll soon be picking up the wins that will help them stay there.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

There was no safety net.#The team at Comfort International are involved in a iety of projects in Central Africa, including working with genocide survivors in Rwanda, rape survivors and displaced people in Congo, and street children in Burundi, Rwanda and South Sudan.Mr Henderson said: #There has been very, very little about the situation overseas.#We have been able to do some special fundraising. We#ve managed to raise an extra £, specically for emergency feeding and we were able to send out extra funds for the Street Kids Rescue project and for vulnerable mothers and babies aswell.#We work with Indigenous partners in all the countries. It was very dficult for them because as soon as they started buying the food they had people who were literally down on their knees asking for food from them because they were starving.#It is the simple reality of people who have no savings, no safety net and no food.#In Congo, the teachers have been particularly badly hit because when the schools close the teachers receive no salary because it comes from the pupils paying a little bit of money.COVID-  has touched us all in some way, including many of our beneficiaries in Central Africa. Hear how lockdown has affected some of the children’s lives in Rwanda.In response to increased dficulties caused by the recent pandemicwe are lting an appeal to raise £,.If would like to help us in raising these funds then please follow this link where you you can make a donation 👉 https:www.totalgiving appeal CIcovidresponse.#comfortinternational #alittlecanchangeale #COVID #appeal #rwanda #see #pray #respond #wearecomfortPosted by Comfort International on Thursday,  June #We were able to send funding over for food for the teachers. They have been working in really dficult situations anyway.#Mr Henderson added that, in Rwanda, the time of year the virus began to spread posed particular issues because it coincided with the commemoration of the genocide.He said: #The time of year that the virus was at its height is also the time of the commemoration of the genocide in Rwanda and so our partners are very often doing a lot of counselling and visiting and encouragement of the survivors# communities. They weren#t able to do any of that this year.#I was speaking to one of our partners who said that the survivors are saying it#s almost like being back in  when there was nobody there to help them so they#ve really struggled because they haven#t had that support.#Despite lockdown restrictions, a number of fundraising efforts have taken place to ensure that the charity has been able to continue its support to those who are struggling overseas.Mr Henderson said that one person, a business director, has given up their complete directors# salary to the charity, two months in a row, for emergency feeding.And one family of five has spent the past few weeks cycling and rowing the distance from Glasgow to Kigali, Rwanda, around , miles.He himself participated in the Virtual Kiltwalk on July , but doubled it by walking  miles in one day # walking  miles for himself and  miles on behalf of his we, Izzy, who was struck down with coronavirus and unable to take part herself.Posted by Callum Henderson on Saturday,  July He praised the #extraordinary# efforts of all those who have contributed towards the fundraising over the past few months.Anyone wishing to donate to Comfort International can do so by clicking this link.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

In my heyday in the late s and early s people would come from all over – Edinburgh, Stirling, up north – and travel to see the guitars I was dealing, particularly the high-end professional stuff.“But over the last five or six years with the internet there is no need for that and you lose your demographic, so it is mostly just locals who need stuff coming in now.“But I have had my time and I would not have had it any other way.“Turning a hobby, a passion, into a business, that is the Holy Grail, you can’t get better than that.“I have been able to work with guitars all day, play guitars, sell them and make a living from it.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

defeat of Hibernian at Pittodrie.There was a sense of foreboding at that match the coronavirus could have an impact on football. What impact, no one could have predicted five months ago.Now we know. Football, and reporting on it, is a very dferent experience.Since the March shutdown there have been predictions of Armageddon for many clubs and that the Scottish game was facing an existential crisis.With no supporters allowed into stadiums and no matchday revenue, those are very legitimate, and ongoing, fears.Following the chaos and ision caused by the SPFL’s decision to call time on the leagues, surely the Joint Response Group must put a plan in orderthere is a second wave.There must be definite protocol in place should the leagues shut down again to avoid a repeat of the embarrassing farce we witnessed this summer.It was only last Monday, five days before the big kick-off, that we knew for definite Hearts were relegated.Had the three-man arbitration  voted the other way, the league start may have been delayed.In the initial months of the shutdown, there were genuine concerns football would notat any level again this year.They say absence makes the heart grow fonder. That was certainly true for me.Pittodrie would have been rocking for this opener, but it was silent save for the shouts of the players and management.Protocol for those fortunate enough to be inside Pittodrie was stringent.A medical questionnaire had to be completed on the morning of the game and a temperature check was done at the gate prior to entry.If your temperature is .C or higher, you are directed to your car. There you would have to wait for  minutes until a further check. Fail again and access is denied.Thankfully my temperature was fine.Inside there was strict social distancing and everyone wore face masks at all times.The combination of specs with the mask causes the lenses to mist up until it seems a thick haar is drting in from the North Sea.In between wiping my glasses, it was like watching Aberdeen’s European Cup Winner’s Cup semi-final loss to Porto in .Hopefully from September  onwards there will be some voices of the Red Army reverberating around the stadium.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon indicated the phasedof fans could begin then.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy. Teaching children the beauty of the outdoors and how to care for it can bring a lelong love for natureyou love something you usually wish to protect it.And learning never stops for any of us. Sometimes it is the basics that are needed before we move on to the complexities of natural navigation or learning our stars.So for this month here is one tip : learn how to go to the toilet in the outdoors!Doing this responsibly and teaching your children makes for a lelong enjoyment of walking and exploring without the bane of wondering where the next toilet is. I know many people who find it incredibly dficult, not great when in the middle of nowhere miles from home.In a nutshell the key is to carry out all paper and sanitary waste in a sealable bag, to go aMountaineering Scotland has excellent online guidance on how to dispose of your natural waste.I hope, like me, you will wish to continue to enjoy nature and take the time to care for and immerse your senses in this beautul world we live in."},{"url":null,"title":"golf clubs set to benefit from covid support fund","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf clubs that have been affected financially by the coronavirus pandemic are being offered support via a funding package funded by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews.In total the funding is worth £, and clubs affiliated to Scottish Golf can apply for grants being made available via two separate allocations the Covid- Fixed Costs Grant and the Club Relief Fund.Fixed Costs Grant will enable every affiliated club in Scotland to apply for aThese can include but are not exhaustive of sanitation products, Covid-related health and safety equipment, professional fees, signs, training, video conferencing licenceand any other Covid-related spend.The Club Relief Fund has been created to provide financial support to clubs who have been impacted by the pandemic and is concentrated on enabling clubs to reinstate or to increase expenditure in key areas to either improve member experience or boost income generation potential.Clubs applying to this fund are required to complete a four-stage application to ensure the review committee have the correct information available to allocate funds.The information required includes:• Standard Club Criteria and AgreementA Scottish Golf spokesperson said: #While the provision of this funding is most welcome, we do anticipate the volume of applications to be high and the criteria outlined will be strictly applied to ensure that the funds available are distributed where most needed.#We continue to explore other funding options for clubs to access and will communicate any additional opportunities should these arise.#The application process for both grants is open now until Friday July .

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

The standard, however, drives costs up dramatically and can make small, rural developments unaffordable.Careful planning of the specication could reduce building costs but still produce warm, highly insulated and comfortable homes.#While there is Scottish Government funding for affordable housing and funding through the Highlands and Islands Enterprise Agency for workshop units, there is no funding for #combined# units which incorporate a home and a workspace.This would allow young entrepreneurs to acquire a starter home or a home worker to relocate.Argyll and Bute Council has one of the highest approval rates for new planning applications in Scotland.It said: #Masterplans are rarely implemented in Argyll and Bute but they are used occasionally to enable the partial development of larger areas of land.#Infrastructure costs make up a signicant proportion of the cost of new build housing particularly in smaller scale developments.#"},{"url":null,"title":"a welcome awaits at kilmartin church","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsServices are scheduled to re-start at Glassary, Kilmartin and Ford Parish Church early next month.Trustees hope to open the modern and welcoming church building at Barr Mhor, Kilmartin, for worship from Sunday August , starting at am.Social distancing will allow for up to  people to attend and everyone is expected to wear a face covering.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer.Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go.The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"surge for ferry tickets expected today","story":"Ellis ButcherUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCalMac has today opened up bookings into October but has warned customers its telephone and websites will be #very busy#.Following discussions with Transport Scotland, the ferry company opened bookings at am for the period up to and including October .It said customer reservations made before bookings closed earlier this year are already in the system.But with the implementation of the latest physical distancing guidelines, capacity on ferries will still be less than it would be in normal circumstances, the company said.The company said: #Access to our website will be managed by a queue system, which is in place during periods of high demand to provide an improved booking experience.#When in the queue, customers will automatically be directed to our website when it#s their turn.

responsibility for reducing danger onto drivers is among proposals announced as part of a Department for Transport consultation on updating the road usersrsquo hand book.What other changes are set to be made The planned updates also include:Announcing the consultation, the DfT explained: \"[The hierarchy of road users] ensures that those road users who can do the greatest harm have the greatest responsibility to reduce the danger or threat they may pose to other road users.\"The objective of the hierarchy is not to give priority to pedestrians, cyclists and horse riders in every situation, but rather to ensure a more mutually respectful and considerate culture of safe and effective road use that benefits all users.This principle, it added: ldquoapplies most strongly to drivers of large goods and passenger vehicles, followed by vans minibuses, cars taxis and motorcycles.The other major changes include rules to create clearer and stronger priorities for pedestrians, particularly at junctions, and clary where pedestrians have right of way.This will include recommending cars and bikes turning into or out of side roads give way to pedestrians waiting to cross.The third major point of the updates will place a requirement on drivers to give priority to cyclists when they are turning into or out of a junction, or changing direction or lane, just as they would to other motor vehicles.Specic guidance for drivers sets out the speeds and distances drivers should observe when passin cyclists and horse riders.The new text says drivers passing cyclists should leave a gap of at least . metres at speeds under mph and at least two metres at more than mph.It also says they should not pass horses at more than mph and with a gap of at least two metres.The updated Code will also recommend drivers adopt the ldquoDutch reach method of getting out of a car.This means using the hand furthest from the door to pull the handle, which forces you to twist your body, making it more likely yoursquoll see a cyclist approaching from behind.EV drivers will also be warned to ensure charging cables do not present a trip hazard for pedestrians and new guidance will highlight the growing use of blanket mph zones in place of the standard mph limit in urban areas.What has the reaction been to the planned changes The RAC said it broadly welcomed the proposed changes but said the right-of-way changes needed clarication for everybodys safety.RAC head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said: \"Overall the ambition behind the proposed Highway Code changes is to make the roads safer for everyone.\"A part of that is making it crystal clear we all have a shared responsibility to ensure one anotherrsquos safety on the road, whether you are travelling on foot, on a bicycle or in a motor vehicle.\"Many other changes made to the Code, such as recommending the lsquoDutch reachrsquo when exiting a vehicle to check for cyclists and taking care when charging electric vehicles, are also very sound.ldquoWe also welcome the new guidance contained in the Code on the safe passing of roadside workers.\"Every day, our patrols and recovery workers put themselves at risk to help others and the more that can be done to protect them, the safer that job becomes.ldquoItrsquos vital now that every final change made to the Code is well communicated.\"While drivers should keep up with changes to the Highway Code, our research suggests only half have consulted it at any time in the last  years."},{"url":null,"title":"campers-vandalism-beauty-spot-slammed","story":"The shocking

number of people camping on our sites.ldquoOnly wild camping is permitted in the countryside ndash light-weight and done in small numbers.

He saw it dferently, calling her interventions ldquointolerable.The Thatcher-Major tussle was something of an exception, with most past leaders taking care not to criticise from the sidelines. Yet the rules, as well as being unwritten, are fluid. Mr Major himself threatened to take Boris Johnson to court for proroguing parliament.Tony Blair has fast become the past premier most likely to pop up with ldquohelpful advice, as he showed on Sky Newsrsquos Ridge on Sunday.With the BBC Sunday programmes now on their summer hols, presenter Sophy Ridge made the most of being the only show in town, breezing straight in on the dayrsquos big story ndash the sudden imposition of a fortnightrsquos quarantine for holidaymakers ing from Spain. Among those caught out by the rule change was Englandrsquos Transport Secretary, Grant Shapps.Jon Ashworth, Shadow Health Secretary, called the Governmentrsquos performance ldquoshambolic.\"There are holidaymakers in Spain at the moment confused and distressed, there are people about to go on holiday to Spain and the islands like Tenere who are confused, and they dont know whether their employers will allow them to take two weeks quarantine. The Government is just saying, We hope that employers co-operate. I hope I win the lottery on Saturday but that doesnt mean it is going to happen.Dominic Raab, the Foreign Secretary, was a hasty addition to the line-up. On a typical Sunday, Ridge has to make do with grabbing pavement interviews with Ministers when they are on their way to The Andrew Marr Show. This time, Mr Raab was live in the studio, at the requisite two metre social distance.No worker following quarantine guidance should be penalised by employers, he said, including by being put onto sick pay.\"If someone is following the law in relation to quarantine and self-isolating the way they should, they cant have penalties taken against them.\"As for his ministerial colleague Mr Shapps being caught on the hop, the Foreign Secretary said it showed the risks for everyone.Mr Raab could not guarantee other countries would follow Spain and be taken off the ldquosafe list.\"All we can say is weve got this Joint Biosecurity Centre, we monitor the risk in real time, we take decisive swt action and so there is an element of uncertainty this summerpeople go abroad.

The latter seems unlikely given how busy he seems to be with the modestly titled Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. Its latest position paper, Learning to Live Alongside Covid-, was ostensibly the reason for his latest appearance.It was a wide-ranging interview covering everything from Russia and China to Scottish independence. You can read what he had to say in full where in the paper, but in summary: Boris Johnson was uselessScottish Labour had been uselessand current Labour leader Keir Starmer was proving usefulIt was fairly predictable stuff for the former Prime Minister, except for the end when Ridge asked why he could not seem to wrench himself away from politics. Isnrsquot it time to take a break, she wondered, go round the golf course or to the shepherdrsquos hut  David Cameron famously opted for the latter, spending a cool pound, on one for his Cotswolds garden.Mr Blair seemed momentarily taken aback. ldquoItrsquos not something I want to do. A lot of people might think thatrsquos exactly what he should do, stop talking about things. But I care about the country, I think we are at a huge moment of change in the world.Addressing the elephant backseat passenger in the room, he went on: ldquoIrsquove tried to do something that previous prime ministers have not done, but in the future I predict that many more will try and do because you leave office when yoursquove still got a lot of years of active working le.ldquoI always say to peopleyou donrsquot want to listen to me itrsquos a free world, donrsquot bother.\"But Irsquom not going to be playing rounds of golf or sitting twiddling my thumbs.

Along the way, she meets a myriad of characters including a scandalous dominatrix, Chera Lamorwho particularly captures Lucys imagination.Seeing as the show is based on a volume of erotica, you can expect to see some bold sex scenes on screen, which look they could be quite awkward to film.Was there anything the cast drew a line under when it came to depicting characters in intimate situations \"I was very clear from the very beginning of what is allowed and what is not allowed,\" declares Marwan, who was born in Lebanon, but grew up in Beirut and then Iowa.\"Im still scared to this day, to right this second, for when Little Birds comes out, how many family members Im going to lose.\"It sounds like Marwan being quite jokey at first, but then she stresses: \"Its funny, but its not funny even though I made sure that I would never show my breasts or my ass or I would never be in a scene where Im having sex, its still like I did too much for what my family would expect from me.\"The production [team], the director, were very, very understanding... It just felt like any boundary that the actor would set during the scene was accepted immediately, which made me comfortable to be able to do the scene.\"\"Stacie has been quite attentive to any conversation we would want to have with her, related to any intimate scenes,\" follows Raphael Acloque, who portrays an Egyptian aristocrat named Adham Abaza.\"She was always available, whenever we needed to discuss anything about it.\"Hugh Skinner - known for shows such as Fleabag and WA - plays Hugo, who is not only trapped in a relationship with Lucy, who he doesnt love, but we also see trying to become an arms dealer.\"Its so hard because when you put it like that, he sounds dreadful,\" quips London native Skinner, .\"But there are a lot of external forces weighing down on him and, in that sense, hes a bit of an emotionally stunted pinball.\"But despite being gay and deciding to marry a woman, hes really lucked out with Lucy actually because she proves to be incredible.\"All the characters, theyre all sort of outsiders in a lot of ways, taking ownership of their otherness and transcending the situation, and hes lucky to be with Lucy as she finds liberation.\"This may be a period drama, but theres no denying that the themes will resonate with modern audiences.For example, the idea of people being desperate to shake off the shackles of society still very much exists today, I suggest.\"Yeah, I think power struggles will always exist and I think this show is all about people fighting for their own agency, or struggling for their own independence whether thats personally, or politically, thats always going to be relevant,\" -year-old Nina Sosanya, who plays eccentric entertainer Lili Von X, nods in agreement.\"Its going to have a wide audience, because its set in a particular period, but its a period thats incredibly attractive to us anyway, just visually,\" continues the Londoner, who starred alongside Skinner in WA, and is also known for BBC One drama Last Tango In Halax.\"And youre going to have people that have lived through those changes - a section of the audience that might sometimes be overlooked, which is the people that are older than us, -plus who have actually seen those changes, who have lived through the sexual revolution of the s...

She never knowingly places a mark where there shouldnrsquot be one, working in oil paints on paper pasted onto board, drawing into the wet paint with a pencil. There is a light, sketch-like touch to all her paintings which conjures up the ephemeral nature of human interaction with nature.As King says, she loves the freedom this surface gives to combine washes and slicks of oil with fluid pencil marks. Having taken a year off when her daughter was born  months ago, the Borders-based painter ed to the easel at the end of last year to transfer a mass of images from her head onto board.It looks effortless, but I am sure it is not. As the painter Francis Bacon once said: ldquoreal painting is a mysterious and continuous struggle with chance.The result is a new body of work which has just gone on show at the at Resipole Studios on the shores of Loch Sunart. I stumbled upon the exhibition, featuring  new paintings , at the end of a lockdown-easing few days on Ardnamurchan. With the gallery having tentatively re-opened two weeks earlier, the exhibition launched without a fanfare, which is in keeping with the unshowy nature of Kingrsquos oeuvre.I first came across the work of King in  at the old Glasgow Art Fair on George Square. I wasnrsquot exactly flush, or in a position to buy a painting, but when I spotted a wee painting by King of a hedgerow in Catterline on Aberdeenrsquos Gallery Heinzel stand, I couldnrsquot resist. I found myself paying up the pound price tag on ten interest-free instalments through the brilliant Own Art scheme. It gives me great joy on a daily basis.King had spent two residencies over subsequent winters at Joan Eardleyrsquos clftop studio, the Watchie in Catterline, and the spirit of the place, which had so inspired Eardley, seeped into her bones. Today, prices for an Anna King painting are considerably more than pound but Irsquod say they are worth every penny. There has been a subtle gear-sht in her approach to subject matter. Where once she looked to wastelands, abandoned buildings and barren pieces of scrub-land, now she is drawn to forestry clear-fell sites near where she lives in a small village on the edge of a community woodland.But nature is not always natural. It can be as industrialised as we humans make it. Many of us have been looking more closely at the world around us in lockdown and, in this body of work, King is ahead of the curve.When I talk to her a few days after seeing her paintings, she tells me about going into her studio as lockdown began. ldquoIn the first few weeks, as spring was about to begin, I wanted to pin down the images of winter trees. I can keep images in my head for a while and I became quite focused on nature taking over after trees had been felled. There are normally big areas in the Borders as there are in other parts of Scotland, but I got interested in lsquoshelter beltsrsquo ndash strips of trees ndash which are there to provide shelter for stock.Although she probably wasnrsquot thinking of Ardnamurchan or the Road to the Isles when she painted this new work, the parallels of the scenery encountered along the way to Loch Sunart are obvious and part of a wider phenomenon in Scotland of nature as industry. As we drove around last week, forests of non-native spruce ndash some felled, some not ndash would regularly hove into view.As King says: ldquoAlthough we often think of any trees as being lsquonaturalrsquo, when it comes to non-native forestry plantations, there is no doubt that this land has been as industrialised as any quarry or built environment.There is an almost post-apocalyptic feel to devastated tracts of nature on our hillsides and Kingrsquos paintings of trees reminded me of the way in which you see a ghostly imprint in your mindrsquos eye when you get an eye-test. ldquoThatrsquos exactly how I see things I want to paint!rsquo she laughs. ldquoWhen I close my eyes, I can see the shape.King, who graduated from Duncan of Jordantsone College of Art in Dundee in , is now in her mid-thirties and having taken a year off from painting seems to have ed with more vigour and focus.ldquoTaking the time out when my daughter was born has been useful, she says. ldquoIrsquove come back more focused with the knowledge that time is precious. Irsquove become more focused on the area local to us here in the Borders. We live on the edge of a community woodland and I find myself constantly looking at shapes, which I can see when my eyes close.ldquoIrsquove never been one for a big splash. I just chip away at the next painting and things change gradually. We have big skies here and lots of light. Therersquos so much to see.There is so much to enjoy and admire in Anna Kingrsquos work. Itrsquos mature and assured without being shouty or trying too hard to own its place in the world. She looks beyond the obvious to make subtle marks which speak about our place in the world ndash and in nature.Anna King Solo, Resipole Studios, Loch Sunart, Acharachle, Argyll, PH HX,  , www.resipolestudios Tue-Sun, am to pm.

A HEROS DEATHDublin post-punk band Fontaines DC set up their stage last year with the release of debut album, Dogrel.Strikingly unapologetic about their identity and relentless in their projections as a side-lined generation, these themes remain heavily resonant in their highly-anticipated follow up, A Heros Death.To some, it may sound a little more polished than its predecessor, but the four-piece have maintained such a high level of artistry within their lyrics - Grian Chatten, the groups vocalist, has previously spoken of the bands common admiration for Irish working class poetry and using this medium, amongst a million musical influences, to sew together masterpiece after masterpiece.Its a very clever album, paying homage to the monotony of the daily grind while giving us glimpses into the untold tales of success that doesnt include how rated you are in terms of wealth and social status.Standout tracks include the album opener I Dont Belong, A Heros Death, Televised Mind and the end song, No.ALANIS MORISSETTE - SUCH PRETTY FORKS IN THE ROADMorissettes ninth studio album Such Pretty Forks In The Road sees the Canadian-American singer-songwriter keeping one hand in her pocket.The opening number, Smiling, was specially written for Morissettes jukebox musical Jagged Little Pill, and deals with the facade we put on for others.Its typical of the rest of the album in that listener walks a tightrope, never knowing whether the tone will veer towards self-deprecating vulnerability or scornful indference.Theres also a musical theatre feeling to Missing The Miracle, which traces the moment where a couple with dfering perspectivessee eye to eye.Nemesis, on the other hand, sees Morissette make a foray into Eurovision territory, with a soaring chorus harking back to her dance roots .Sometimes Morissettes confessional style leads her to some hard-to-stomach choices, such as the pitchy yodelling on Her.Though perhaps we should be thankful: at least its not autotuned!Pretty Forks as a record is not completely downbeat, but when the refrain of Sandbox Love hits, you feel a spark of exuberance missing from the rest of the album.As in the lead single Reasons I Drink, it comes on all familiar in the first few bars, propelled by a great piano hook, but then we settle into a chorus that is disappointingly anonymous, typical of an album that never quite risks soaring to the heights of Ironic or You Oughta Know.STEVE JONES REVIEW NEEDS ADDINGCREEPER - SEX, DEATH  THE INFINITE VOIDSouthamptons Creeper were never a straightforward punk band, but the five-piece have left the genre a long way behind on their second album.Influences include Roy Orbisons widescreen romance, and s glam rock - singer Will Gould announced the end of Creeper at the final gig touring their debut album, using the words David Bowie killed off Ziggy Stardust in .Fittingly for a band that has risen from the dead, Creeper have turned the goth up to , starting with rain and thunder effects and Patricia Morrison, ex-Sisters of Mercy and The Damned, intoning \"for the devil almighty reigns\" on the -second spoken word Hallelujah!Then its into the infectious Be My End, referencing vampires and with a huge singalong chorus, setting the tone for an ambitious, theatrical album.Cyanide has an epic rock sound, with Gould singing \"shes Christina Applegate, hopelessly beautul in \", Thorns Of Love, with a s feel, references the deaths of John Lennon and Ian Curtis in  and the affecting piano ballad All My Friends closes the album.Despite the ominous themes and song titles, Creeper dont take themselves too seriously, and are not afraid to throw in the kitchen sink in their search for maximum impact.They tour again in March but Sex, Death  The Infinite Void sounds tailor-made for festivals and stadiums, which with any justice theyll be playing next summer.MAX RICHTER - VOICESA concept album based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights might sound like a lofty project, but this sort of thing is Max Richters bread and butter.Following on from his recent record Sleep - an eight-hour lullaby based on the science of shut-eye - the prolic British composer hasnt lowered his sights.Voices begins with a star cameo from the late Eleanor Roosevelt, who reads the declaration in a scratchy recording accompanied by stirring choral music.The baton is then passed to US actress Kiki Layne, best known for her starring role in If Beale Street Could Talk.Across  tracks encompassing piano, choir and orchestra, as well as a range of international influences, Richter presents an at times moving, at other times pointed reflection on a pivotal document that, at more than  years of age, simultaneously feels like part of our immediate history and our distant past.Indeed, while the record has been in the works for some time, the timing of its release could, sadly, not be more apt."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11652747.jpg?type=article-full","title":"coronavirus-scotland-artisan-food-market-prepares-welcome-visitors-back-lockdown","story":"Food producers who are part of the Bowhouse artisan hub in the East Neuk of Fe were involved in an imaginative supply link during lockdown and were able to bring present their goods to enthusiastic foodies.The traditional monthly market closed its doors at the beginning of lockdown, but what emerged in its place allowed producers to offer a combination of home delivery and a collection service through Bowhouse Link virtual market.While keen to reconnect with customers, Bowhouse Link plans to run a blended format with both weekly orders and monthly events.On Saturday August  they will be opening their doors for an open collection day. Organic beef, lamb, venison and pork from Butchery at Bowhouse, wholemeal organic flours from Scotland the Bread, organic vegetables and salads from East Neuk Market Garden, rums, ciders, beers and natural wines from Futtle Organic Brewery, game meats from Woodmill Game, cheeses from the neighbouring St Andrews Farmhouse Cheese Company, will all be featured.

It gives us great pleasure to be able to welcome a collection day as a chance to experience Bowhouse in person and explore the amazing range of food and drink available from Fe.A box of delights from Bowhouse food hubSam Parsons, Balcaskie Estate Manager where Bowhouse is based, said that lockdown allowed them to focus specically on growing the online side of the business.ldquoAs lockdown was very sudden, we had to look at how do we change direction and quickly and how do we commit to how to making Bowhouse a food hub for people to come and collect from regularly, said Mr Parsons. ldquoMarkets are a great way to connect customers to producers, but we wanted to focus on fresh seasonal local produce and that doesnrsquot gel completely with once a month event.ldquoWe wanted to make it a more frequent event and we are happy to be a collection point and an aggregator for multiple producers. This landed at the right time for us and we could really focus on this.During lockdown shoppers saw their habits change due to travel restrictions and availability, which gave Bowhouse a chance to introduce itself to new people.Mr Parsons added: ldquoI think two things struck me very early on in lockdown. Meal times became social gatherings and cohesion between families. People became much more interested in their food and there seemed to be a lot of social media around it and families coming together. That was long overdue as we have all been guilty of grab what you can. Where the food came from and who produced it suddenly became important to people. I think local food distributors and producers showed resilience and became more important. I think people have remembered that food security - can we produce it, can we get it - now matters to them.Read more: Coronavirus in Scotland: Vulnerable Scots ease into new normal as shielding comes to an endA weekly online collection, run through Open Food Network, started in lockdown and took the place of the monthly markets and this Saturday will be the first time people will be able to go back to a market environment.They will be running the usual weekly collection, with orders able to be placed between Monday and Wednesday, ready for collection in slots between am and am.

People seem to want to be able to connect with their produce and know where it has come from.ldquoWith the opening up of the tourist season and self-catering we have seen people inquire about ordering from us for their stay at a holiday home. I am delighted they are coming to us rather than stocking up the car with supermarket good before they leave their home town.Ms Jack said they had been providing  to  orders a weeks for the past  weeks and they are looking forward to seeing how the event goes.She added: ldquoIt will be a very relaxed event with street food being offered and a chance for people to meet the producers again and for some meet them for the first time.ldquoWe have had new customers discover us in lockdown and this will give them a chance to meet the person who has produced their food.

Recognition value within his own party may even be a moot point .Yet the -year-old north east native apparently believes he has what it takes to lead the Scottish Tories to victory in next Mayrsquos Holyrood election and achieve what his biggest supporter, Baroness Davidson of Lundin Links, failed to do: become First Minister.Despite no public profile to speak of and very little time to build one, Mr Rossrsquos approach over the last few days has certainly been bold. Ruthless, even, in way he and the party swept Jackson Carlaw aside.You get the feeling his campaign team hope for a Barack Obama-style recognition trajectory: at the beginning of  few knew who Obama was by the end of that year he was US President. If Mr Rossrsquos first approach to voters is anything to go by, however, the political figure we may be soon be comparing him to is Jo Swinson. Team Ross would be well-advised to learn lessons from the former Lib-Dem leaderrsquos disastrous  general election campaign, not least how poorly she communicated with voters in Scotland.Itrsquos early days, obviously, and Mr Ross hasnrsquot even been elected party leader yet, though this looks like a coronation rather than a competition. But the piece Mr Ross wrote for a newspaper yesterday, setting out his stall, was ill-conceived to say the least. Indeed, the sort of undecided voter his party desperately needs to pick up over the next few months may have found themselves themselves wincing, even chuckling, at some of the tone-deaf rhetoric.Herersquos an example. Near the beginning of the Sunday Times article Mr Ross states that ldquoa decade and more of nationalist government has left Scotland a ided country. Many readers, even those who donrsquot support the SNP, may immediately find themselves thinking about the how a decade of Tory government at Westminster has indeed left Scotland ided. Between the haves and the have nots. Between the working and the working poor. Between those who benefit from employment rights and those left at the mercy of the so-called gig-economy. Between those who rely on deliberately-underfunded public services and those who donrsquot have to.ldquoItrsquos the nature of nationalism to ide, Mr Ross goes on, seemingly without a hint of irony. The Little England narrative peddled by Boris Johnson and his cronies delivered Brexit at the ballot box, a isive and disastrous outcome that the vast majority of Scots remain economically, socially and ideologically opposed to.Letrsquos see how a no deal Brexit on  December - an outcome engineered and encouraged by a game-playing Prime Minister roundly despised and distrusted in Scotland - works out for Mr Rossrsquos Holyrood campaign. Such a result would undoubtedly heap even more misery upon Scottish businesses already on the brink after what will, by the end of the year, be -months of Covid--related downturn.Mr Ross is apparently a keen supporter of Boris JohnsonMaybe he truly believes he can influence Mr Johnson on Brexit policy where Ruth Davidson, David Mundell and Jackson Carlaw failed.But there lies the fundamental, inescapable rub for Scottish Tories. It doesnrsquot matter who leads them. They are shackled to a UK party that appears to revel in acting against the best interests of Scotland.Those most committed to the Union will still cast their votes for the party next May. They have nowhere  to go.But polls over the last few months have detected a sht. The size of this steadfastly pro-Union group looks like it is decreasing, largely due to Brexit. Younger voters remain overwhelmingly in support of independence.In a bid to counter this, Mr Ross refers throughout the aforementioned article to patriotism, a term associated with the sort of brash Brexiteers most in Scotland canrsquot stand, and is surely no less problematic than ldquonationalism.The architects of his campaign - among them Michael Gove - have little choice but to focus on ldquosaving the Union. But how do you even begin to do this when your own party works against you at every turn  That remains the enduring, unanswerable question for whoever leads the Scottish Tories."},{"url":null,"title":"development-plans-recreation-site-largest-urban-land-buyout-scotland-secured-500-000","story":"Our Glen, which is land at the Historic Douglas Support Estate, was bought by Viewpark Conservation Group, in Lanarkshire, and its , and is the biggest urban land buyout in scale in Scotland, at  acres with funds of pound, from the Scottish Land Fund.Land Reform Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: ldquoCommunities across the country, whilst impacted in so many ways by the Covid- lockdown, are playing a vital role in maintaining our resilience, our spirit and local support networks.ldquoThey will also play a critical role in our recovery from the pandemic, which is why I am delighted that the Viewpark Conservation Group ndash one of  projects to have received a share of pound. million of Scottish Land Fund in   - has finalised its community buyout.

The Terrors were extremely well organised and made a potentially nerve wracking experience stress free for those of us who were lucky enough to take in their first game back in the Premiership.They would have loved the stands to be full of adoring supporters for the unfurling of the Championship winners flag, but with the stadium decorated in tangerine flags and supporter cutouts, they certainly made the best out of a bad situation.As much as it was great to be back at a live game, the lack of fans was the one big disappointment and I believe it certainly had an impact on those out on the pitch.United played against the  men of St Johnstone for the best part of  minutes on Saturday and threatened Elliott Parish in the Saints goal only once.If the stands had been packed with Tannadice followers urging their team on to attack, it could have quite easily been an opening day three points for Micky Mellonrsquos side.Therersquos talk of it being September before supporters are able toto their seats in stadiums across Scotland, albeit in reduced numbers.In my opinion this stage, with empty stadia, could have both positive and negative effects on teams.Dundee United, as previously mentioned, are a prime example of the way a lack of supporters can have a negative impact.But for a team like Rangers, I think an empty Ibrox for the opening period of the season could work as an advantage.Nobody can disagree that it takes a special player to perform week in week out in front of , and in recent seasons some Gers players have been guilty of finding that pressure too much.In contrast, having no one in the stands, players can focus fully on the job in hand ndash getting three points on the board week in week out.Consistency will grow confidence and when the time comes for supporters to make their way back through the Ibrox turnstiles, players should not find the weight of expectancy as heavy as usual.Only time will tellsupporter absence will play a key role in deciding where the title ends up this season, but letrsquos just take a minute to appreciate that our game is back.The league we love and adore, the teams we, in normal circumstances, would follow across the country every week are back on our screens.There was pressure on the Scottish game last weekend to get it right after a summer of squabbling between clubs and the SPFL about how the season was ended.It featured on our televisions and computer screens almost as much as the pandemic we are experiencing.But again I will reiterate, nobody has experienced anything like this before and cut-throat decisions had to be made.Those at the top got it right at the weekend and we must continue to showcase football in Scotland in the best possible way moving forward.The Scottish Premiership is one of the few leagues running at the moment and with an operational pay-per-view service and Sky Sports on our side - it is time to show the rest of Europe what we are all about.The talent is there and a captive audience is here now more than ever.You simply cannae beat it.

I would have been almost as surprisedthe result had been Clarkston or Newton Mearns. But the coronavirus crisis has shted perceptions and priorities and, according to the property firm behind this study, previously desirable attributes such as air quality, open spaces and residentsrsquo happiness have now to be measured against broadband speed and ease of home working.According to those who said that lockdown had changed their priorities,  per cent were more likely to want a garden. Thatrsquos maybe not very surprising, especially after a period when many people could go out only briefly to exercise or shop, and later, could meet limited numbers of people, but only outside.To take another example, one barbecue manufacturer reports recent sales increases of  per cent, which suggests that those who have gardens are using them more, while Amazon recently had to recall a barbecue sold for use on the balconies of blocks of flats over safety concerns, which indicates the limitations of more cramped outdoor space.As with so many property fantasies, I suspect that the participants in this survey are romanticising the idea of a garden, or Gfnock. Growing your own vegetables, building a pizza oven, installing a trampoline or keeping hens are certainly all things that can be done in a garden, but are more of a challenge up a wally close. But theyrsquore all also things that require work and effort and which a lot of people get tired of fairly quickly.The experience of those who have been working from home, rather than going into an office in a city centre or on an urban business park, may have sparked the idea that theyrsquod like to commute a bit less, but it doesnrsquot seem to have persuaded them that itrsquos possible to work entirely from home.If there were a genuine conviction, among either employees or employers, that working from home were to become the norm, surveys such as this one would not focus on commutable areas, still less find their top spots occupied by suburbs. Gfnock may technically be a town, but it s as a suburb .Like the suburbs themselves, working from home may not be as transformative as all that, but rather a sort of halfway house. The question is whether, in the aftermath of coronavirus, being in easy reach of a city centre, but in a nice house with a fair-sized garden, in a quiet area with good schools and excellent broadband, will offer as many advantages as people currently seem to think it will.If office workers can work almost as easily from their own dining rooms, theyrsquove also discovered that they can do their shopping just as easily from there. Online sales across Europe were growing by  per cent in April even after the reopening of some shops, they remained up  per cent on the same time in the previous year. Andyou donrsquot have to commute to a city to work, why would you need to live all that near one at all The answer might have been shops, or restaurants, or leisure facilities, or entertainment venues. But these are the very things that,they are not already closed down for health reasons, are gravely endangered for economic ones.Cities, which have historically been the mark of civilisation and increased wealth, are still overwhelmingly the destination for that portion of the global population seeking to improve their circumstances. Forty years ago, less than  per cent of Chinarsquos population lived in urban areas itrsquos now more than  per cent, and that period exactly matches the countryrsquos economic growth.But in the developed world, or perhaps the digital world, the traditional purpose of the city is less clear, especially with the decline of labour-intensive manufacturing in the West. Automation in factories and the fact that service industries are largely conducted inside computer networks leave retail and hospitality businesses, cultural sites and entertainment as their main assets.Until now, suburbiarsquos main contribution to those fields has been to supply a steady stream of young people so bored by theirdistance from the action that they canrsquot wait to get into the big city.Now that the UKrsquos cities are emptying, and the bright lights are found on YouTube, Instagram or Spoty, itrsquos hard to see why yoursquod want to be in a city, let alone just quite near one. If it offers no good pleasure, as Mrs Brutus put it, why be reduced to dwelling even in its suburbs Itrsquos possible,for most of us unrealistic, to see the appeal of a rural smallholding. Itrsquos easy, for the dynamic, to see the appeal of a bustling metropolis. Butthe metropolis is empty and therersquos no broadband in the wilderness, the suburbs may not be the best of both worlds, but merely the least terrible option. Perhaps Gfnockrsquos triumph is a sign that our future homes will be, like Gertrude Steinrsquos Oakland suburbs, in places where therersquos no ldquothere there.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Measures were put in place including virtual interviews, which enabled them to restart their recruitment drive with almost , shortlisted candidates.Sophie Rowan, , from Kilmarnock in Ayrshire, is going into her final year in project management, and chose the apprentice route over a place at university.Ms Rowan, who is base at BAE Systems Scotstoun yard in Glasgow, said: ldquoI always knew I wanted to leave school early. I didnrsquot really enjoy my school years and had begun to apply for university places while in fth year.ldquoI was also working in a fast food restaurant part time and by chance someone said why donrsquot you look for an apprentice position. I really didnrsquot know much about it but discovered BAE Systems had a programme.ldquoI did end up with a conditional offerI passed my highers and at the same time I applied to BAE. It was then I realised the opportunities to be had. I was interested in business studies and the chance to work and study project management appealed to me. For me there was no dilemma when I ended up with a choice of an apprenticeship or going to university. I knew I wanted to take on the apprenticeship.Read more: Coronavirus in Scotland: Health industry group disappointed over gym reopening delayMs Rowan is now entering her third and final year of the apprenticeship and has never looked back.She added: ldquoI am still getting a qualication while working in an office environment.

I had been working part time and had the chance to progress and took it. What teenager wouldnrsquot want to run a nightclub.He ran Musselburgh Race Course for a year and worked for a firm involved in the Queenrsquos garden party at the Palace of Holyrood House.ldquoI enjoyed my career and had some fantastic opportunities, added Mr Donlevy. ldquoHowever, with a young family the hours no longer suited and I put myself through an HND in electrical engineering. I started to look into apprenticeships but I didnrsquot knowage would be a barrier and it turned out it wasnrsquot. I secured a place with BAE Systems. It has been mixture of studying and placements and I got the chance to spend time working on the Prince of Wales aircraft carrier in Rosyth and then did seven weeks of sea trials on it. It has been a fantastic experience. I think this apprenticeship has given me the career I was meant to have and it turns out age hasnrsquot been a problem. I have ended up trying both uni and an apprenticeship.ldquoThe dference for me now is that with this role I can learn from experts in their field every day and it is very hands on.Read more: Coronavirus in Scotland: Vulnerable Scots ease into new normal as shielding comes to an endCharles Woodburn, Chief Executive, BAE Systems is which involved in the programme to develop the Type  Frigates for the Royal Navy, said they are pleased to be helping to create new jobs.He said: ldquoGetting people back to work and creating new jobs, especially for younger people, is a national priority and wersquore pleased to play our part in supporting the UKrsquos economic recovery.

Sadly, when it arrived into our care it had to be put to sleep.ldquoThrough good intentions people are causing these animals unnecessary suffering and, unfortunately, in many cases death.ldquoWild animals do not have the centuries of domestication that companion animals do.ldquoInstinctively, wild animals see humans as a threat and any interaction will cause them a great deal of distress.ldquoWe would ask that the public do not try to take matters into their own hands.ldquoIn the first instance, people should check our website for advice andtheyrsquod still like tospeak to someone, call our animal helpline for information.The Scottish SPCA revealed how one incident in Glasgow involved someone taking a fawn home and keeping it overnight.The person called the charityrsquos animal helpline but did not heed the advice tothe fawn to where they found it. The doe would most likely have been foraging or searching for a safe resting site.The young deer was fed cowrsquos milk which could cause gut upset that can result in more serious, le-threatening issues.One fawn was taken home and wrapped up in dog blankets. When the societyrsquos animal rescue officer arrived it was having seizures due to the amount of stress it was caused.In other instances, people have been taking home cubs and adult foxes and attempting to rear them.One person kept a young fox in a shed for three months until it was too much to cope with and then contacted the Scottish SPCA helpline, at which point it was unsafe for the fox to be released back into the wild.The society launched its #WildleWise campaign in April to educate the public on when theyshould and should not contact them about wildle.Mr Flynn added: ldquoOur animal rescue officers and team at our National Wildle Rescue Centre are experts in treating and rehabilitating wild animals.ldquoWe would urge everyone to leave the care of wild creatures to us to give them the best possible chance of recovery."},{"url":null,"title":"increased-pass-rate-sqa-release-exam-results-scotland","story":"Students who have completed Scottish Qualications Authoritycourses and awards over the past year have had their resultsestimated by teachers due to covid-pandemic.They show the National  pass rate was .%, the Higher pass rate was .% and the Advanced Higher pass rate was .%.In , the National  pass rate was .%, the Higher pass rate was .% and the Advanced Higher pass rate was .%.For the tirst time, exams were cancelled and the governing body had todevise an alternate method of awarding grades based on prelims and coursework assessment.:Teachers warn of legal consequences over Covid safety as Scots schools re-openCabinet Secretary for Education in the Scottish Government John Swinney said:In a year of so many worries, young people should be very proud of their achievements in #SQAResults.

They also provided essential trade routes to the protected waters of Scapa Flow.The medieval Viking names for farms and homesteads have long been known and studied in northern Scotland and the Isles. The new study investigated some of the names that have sea or boat connotations used for places that today are far inland in central Orkney.Names such as Greenay, meaning shallow waters, or Knarstonderived from the words for a transport vesseland a farm or homesteadwhere these vessels were moored. Warth, derived from Old Norse ‘ða’ , may also seem obscure as it is in a low-lying land-locked position today.However, there is evidence from Denmark that the same namewas used for a ‘vagttårne’in low-lying locations along water routes, such as the Roskilde fjord. Many such inland places are today located many miles from the open sea.Researchers used remote sensing geophysical methods to map a series of now infilled channels that extended north from the Loch of Harray to the lochs of Sabiston and Boardhouse towards the Earls seat of power in Birsay. The data was combined with information about the old landscape obtained from environmental records within sediment samples. These were cored from key sites throughout the area. The land is now dominated by agricultural activity and heavily modied by articial drainage networks constructed over the last three centuries making it dficult to see anything of the old waterways at the surface today. However, once the scientic data was analysed it was possible to model the pathways and link them to the nautically named locations.The results showed that a complete route from Harray, through the Loch of Banks and including a portage at Twatt over to the Loch of Boardhouse into the earldom estates in Birsay was easily achieved.The waterway network would have provided a shallow water routeway through which the Norse Vikings were able to haul both their boats and heavy goods, such as grain. Similar navigable waterways are known where in Scotland, for example, at Rubh an Dunain in Skye. This new work changes how we think about the transfer of goods and people in the west of mainland Orkney and perhaps enables historians and archaeologists to find more evidence of water transport in the Viking Age and Late Norse period in the Isles.Dr Alexandra Sanmark of the Institute for Northern Studies at the University of the Highlands and Islands said: “I am delighted with the outcome, as multiple pieces of written and landscape evidence suggested the existence of the waterway. The results will be used in our continued study of how the Norse used and organised the landscape of Orkney.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The SQA then checked and validated the information received. According to the council, moderations to the results, up or down, have been made by the SQA,necessary, to ensure consistency across schools and colleges and consistency with results from previous years.Councillor Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC education, leisure and housing committee said that all had stepped up to the challenges set before them during these unprecedented times.“Never before have the exams been cancelled, so it has been a steep learning curve for all involved and we must acknowledge the efforts of our teaching staff here in Orkney in making these dficult decisions — it is not easy when you know you are playing a part in determining the onward learning journey of students.#But teachers and lecturers are best placed to have a strong understanding of how their learners have performed and, based on their experience and the evidence available, what a learner would be expected to achieve in each course. I am confident all our staff will have made their best overall judgements based on their experience, knowledge and activity throughout the school year – fairness to students was vital in these truly exceptional circumstances, but teachers had to ensure a true reflection of a candidate’s ability.“I wish to offer my congratulations to all those who received results today, for their commitment to their studies, and thank their families, teachers and lecturers and the wider school and college community who supported them.“Today is a day for all pupils and adult learners across Orkney to celebrate their many achievements and successes, after many months and years of study. We are pleased that the overall pass rate across Orkney’s schools remains strong at  per cent – the same as last year’s pass rate.“When schools and college stafffrom the summer holiday detailed analysis of the results will take place, subject by subject, enabling the Council to evaluate trends, build on success and establish where any improvements may be needed.#We remain committed to assist in whatever way we can in helping all students move forward into positive destinations.”Kirkwall Grammar School head teacher, Don Hawkins, expressed his pride a the quality and amount of work carried out by staff to ensure the best possible outcomes for the young people of KGS.He said: “This can also be a time of incredible pressure for our young people and for some this will be a period of extreme anxiety, especiallytheir grades don#t match up to their expectations or hopes.“My message to all young people is that there is no one pathway.  No one’s journey will be exactly what they hoped for.  Congratulations on your success andthe results are not what you had wished, pick yourself up and try again.  As someone once said ‘there is no disgrace in being knocked down, there is only shame in not getting back up never quit!’.#Your parents and teachers will be there to provide you with the support and guidance you need to adapt the plan your pathway going forward.#Orkney schools and other local organisations are on hand to help pupils who are concerned about their exam results, or who just want some advice on what to do next.

We urgently need support from the government for a service that is literally a leline for our most vulnerable and remote communities.“The need for social distancing — while essential — has massively reduced the number of passengers we can carry — and this has had a major impact on the company’s income over the last four months.“This income is a vital part of Orkney Ferries’ funding. But despite this, we have continued to operate fully-manned vessels carrying food, medicine, fuel and many other vital supplies our isles communities depend upon.#Councillor Dawson said an appeal for support has already been made and initially turned down by the government.But he says the board are #shocked# and #appalled# that in addition to supporting other Scottish ferry companies, £ million in emergency Scottish Government funding has been handed out to Glasgow Subway and Edinburgh Trams.Orkney Islands Council has long argued that the service should be fully funded by the Scottish Government, in line with similar leline ferry operations where in Scotland.Councillor Dawson added: “That sends a message that the Government considers the wellbeing of people in the Central Belt to be more important than that of folk in Orkney’s North and South Isles.“We are simply asking for parity in the way the company is treated — and that emergency funding is provided, enabling us to continue our support for the many communities that depend on our inter-island ferry service.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Theyrsquore dealt with quickly and le can go on.ldquoIf on the other hand, the testing and tracing and isolation is not done properly then you get very bad surges occurring. And this will lead to economic challenges.Mr Clarke told Sky News: ldquoI think itrsquos obviously vital that we always continue to keep up the progress that wersquore making with Test and Trace, which is a massive national undertaking and it is working, I really would emphasise that.ldquo, people so far have been contacted by the programme, either whorsquove tested positive or their contacts, and those people have all been allowed to self isolate, removed from the community at a time when they could be at risk of spreading the virus.ldquoThatrsquos obviously a massive success, we reach over % of positive test results and contact over % of their close contacts, so this is a programme which is delivering and which is helping to keep us all safer.Looking forward to getting back to live gigs To help us all get back to the things we love, #GetTested evenyou have mild coronavirus symptoms:## https:t.co CEjLDcz#LetsGetBack pic cAYIHQscrPmdash Department of Health and Social CareAugust , ldquoTherersquos always more to do, we continue to work very hard to boost our testing capacityhellip wersquore on track to deliver half a million by the end of October. But one thing is clear, schools are going to reopen in full in the autumn, that is not up for debate.The modelling study ndash which simulates ious scenarios ndash examined the possible implications of schools reopening in the UK coupled with broader reopening of society, such as more parents ing to the workplace and increased socialising within the community.The researchers from UCL and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found that ldquowith increased levels of testinghellip and effective contact tracing and isolation, an epidemic rebound might be prevented.But in a worst-case scenario, a second wave could be . times higher than the first, according to the study published in The Lancet Child And Adolescent Health.The authors said that without appropriate levels of testing and contact tracing, reopening of schools together with gradual relaxing of the lockdown measures are ldquolikely to induce a second wave that would peak in December schools open full-time in September.Data published on Tuesday by the Office for National Statistics shows that , deaths involving Covid- had occurred in England and Wales up to July , and had been registered by August . vw,vw,px, px\"Daily confirmed cases of Covid- in the UK Figures published last week by the National Records for Scotland showed that , deaths involving Covid- had been registered in Scotland up to July , while  deaths had occurred in Northern Ireland up to July according to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency.Together, these figures mean that so far , deaths have been registered in the UK where Covid- was mentioned on the death certicate, including suspected cases.Meanwhile reports suggest a steep rise in the number of patients waiting for more than a year for NHS treatment.Across London, , patients had been waiting more than  weeks by  July ndash compared to , across England less than  months ago, according to leaked data seen by The Independent.Experts told the news site that increases of a similar scale are likely to be replicated across the UK after many hospital treatments were put on pause during the pandemic.copy -.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce

Both creations have been made by the hands of very talented local Cullybackey people.Shellinghill Park in Cullybackey has for some time been the focus of the ‘CCP In Bloom’ team. Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges. It was a big undertaking but I enjoyed the experience,”he said.  Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing!

Just think of pop royalty like the Beckhams who gted their children the monikers Brooklyn, Cruz, Romeo and Harper.Sir Bob Geldof and his late we Paula were among the early trendsetters when it came to naming their daughters, settling upon Fi Trixibelle, Peaches and Pixie. When Paula went on to have a baby with Michael Hutchence, she kept to the family tradition, calling the little girl Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily.Not all celebrity offspring, however, enjoy being called something a little bit dferent. The late David Bowie named his son Zowie Bowie — full name Duncan Zowie Haywood Jones. At the age of , the youngster said he preferred to be called by his nickname Joey, later shortening it to Joe. Now a film director and screenwriter, he is known as Duncan Jones.He’s not the only one to opt for the ordinary — or at least to rue the day an unusual name seemed an inspired and fun choice.According to a new survey by Gigacalculator, Hunter and Aurora are among the top names parents regret calling their kids. The poll also reveals that thanks to Prime Minister Johnson and President Trump, parents have been totally put off calling their kids Boris or Donald. And mums and dads polled also said they would steer clear of the names Karen, Isis and Meghan for their little girls.So, what’s it like to go through le with a name that turns heads  While most Northern Ireland parents go down a more traditional path, we have tracked down some people with, well, famous names. Elvis Kirk: ‘Lots of people don’t believe I’m called it’Elvis Kirklives in Killyleagh with his we Paula. Elvis has three grown-up children, Tanya , Jonathanand Rebeccaand runs Elvis Kirk Contracts and KC Skip Hire and Recycling. He says he loves his name.“My mother was a big Elvis fan,” he says. “There was a big family of us, eight of us, and I was in the middle somewhere. They all have ordinary country names. There was Mervyn, Sidney, Philip, Alastair who passed away, me, Ronnie, Harold and Sandra.“There was a maternity hospital in Downpatrick called Hardy Greer and my mother was in there about to have me and the radio was on. Elvis had brought the song Teddy Bear out at the time and my mother said to the woman in the bed next to her thatshe had another boy she was going to call him Elvis. And that was how I got stuck with it. “I do like the name. Everyone always says what a lovely name it is but no-one ever calls their child it. At work I do a lot of phone calls andI ring a business and they ask me for my name sometimes you hear them laughing. A lot of them don’t believe that it’s your real name. But it’s quite good fun. We used to call our business Kirk Contracts in the early years and we later changed it to Elvis Kirk Contracts and I think that has been a great help. People see it on the lorries and look twice. It’s good fun.”While some people with such a name might dread being the butt of jokes in the classroom, Elvis says he never had any bother. “The teachers always liked my name. I suppose people thought it was a bit strange but I never got any hassle about it. People liked it more than anything.”And just like the rock’n’roll legend himself, Co Down’s own Elvis has made the headlines in his local newspaper a few times... though not for his singing.“I left school when I was  and have been working ever since, driving diggers and doing demolition, knocking big buildings down and driving big lorries — just rocking, knocking and rolling,” he quips. “We took the old council offices down in the town here about seven years ago and the local newspaper put ‘Elvis is rocking the building’ in the headline for a story on it. I hope to keep on rocking for another few years yet.“I thought some of my grandchildren might have taken my name,” he says. “But not so far. I don’t even know any other Elvis. I had heard of a man down in the country with the name Elvis, but I’m not surethat was his middle name. My first name is Elvis, it’s on my birth certicate, I was christened Elvis. “It’s never given me any problems opening bank accounts or anything. It definitely didn’t make them give me a bigger overdraft.“I wouldn’t change my name. If I came back again I would want to still be called Elvis. My name is part of who I am. “Like the real Elvis I can sing, but unlike the real Elvis I wouldn’t sing in front of anyone. I keep my singing for the shower or in the cab of a lorry. I sing away there.” He adds: “I would be a great Elvis fan, and am really proud to be named after him.”Mercedes Carr: ‘I wouldn’t ever change my name ... it’s part of who I am’Mother of two Mercedes Carr,lives in Londonderry with her partner Christopher and children Kianand Kora . She was named after her father’s dream car.“My mum and dad had seven children,” she says. “And I was the last of seven. My mum said to my dad that he could name the last child. So my daddy got to name me — as my mum named all the rest of the children — and he called me Mercedes. “Daddy was a big Mercedes fan and actually wanted one at the time but he wasn’t in a position to buy one, so he said he would name his daughter Mercedes instead. Dad eventually got his Mercedes, me, and also got a Mercedes car eventually which he had for several years. “It’s an unusual first and second name, but no one really noticed when I was younger, at primary school. But when I went to secondary school people noticed and thought it was a really cool name. No-one ever said it was terrible. When I was growing up and going to school, mum and dad imagined that someone would say something to me, but there was no negativity. Everyone loved it and thought I was lucky to have such an unusual name.“My name is strange, but I do like it. I don’t know anyone with the same name. Mind you, when you go into one of those novelty shops to buy a keyring or a mug with your name on it, I can never find my name there. I suppose a Mercedes car keyring is the only thing that would have my name on it.”When it came to her own son and daughter though, Mercedes decided to stay strictly middle of the road on the name front. “When I had my children I never thought about naming them something as unusual as my own name. I couldn’t do it to them. My fear would be that they would grow up, someone would say something to them about their name and then I would blame myself for giving them that name.”Mercedes, however, says that she is glad that her name has set her apart for le — and wouldn’t change it for the world.“People have trouble spelling my name at times, there are so many ‘e’s in it,” she says. “But it has never been shortened over the years to a nickname. The only person who did that was my best friend who calls me ‘Merc’. When I’m talking to people I don’t know or dealing with banks and things, people say ‘Are you sure that’s your first name ’ I say, ‘Yes I’m pretty sure’. Then I tell them my second name and that’s the showstopper. They think I am messing around with them. “If I could change my name, I wouldn’t. It’s part of who I am. I don’t think I would suit anything . You’ll never find another Mercedes Carr, I’m the only one.”Tyrone Power: ‘It’s not bad being named after a swashbuckling hero’Tyrone Poweris from Ballymena. He is married to Wilma and together they have a daughter Andrea , and son, also Tyrone . Tragically, their other daughter Rhonda died in a crash when she was just -years-old. The retired Gallaher’s factory worker says his mother was a huge fan of a certain Hollywood movie star.“My mother was a big fan of Tyrone Power,” he says. “My name has absolutely nothing to do with the county. “Tyrone Power was famous during the s and s. “He was around at the same time as Errol Flynn and was a swashbuckling, handsome movie star. I think my mum had a notion of him. Thousands and thousands of women attended his funeral. “I do like my name. People don’t recognise it as much now, but years ago people used to ask meI was the famous actor. Now they don’t seem to react as much any more or they think it is some connection with Co Tyrone. “Tyrone, as a first name, has got really popular in the likes of America, but years ago when I was a young man it was a very unusual name. It’s not too bad being named about a swashbuckling hero. Sometimes I wished I was him.”Tyrone says that there was more than one movie star in his street.“People might find this hard to believe, but there was another young fella in my street whose parents called him Errol Flynn. “We were stopped by the police when we were out one night and Errol was asked his name and I was asked my name and the policeman didn’t believe us. “He was going to take us to the barracks because he thought we were messing him around. “Errol’s dead now, but he used to live across the street from us. The neighbours in our street had a bit of a tradition of naming children after film stars. “There was myself, Tyrone Power, an Errol Flynn, a Robert Taylor and a Joan Collins all in the one row. “The postman made a comment in one of the local papers years ago that when he came into Inchkeith Road it was more like Hollywood Bouled with all the stars. I think my mum must have started a trend.“I do like my name. I am proud of it. I’m so proud of it I called my son Tyrone also. I wouldn’t change my name to anything less unusual. It’s given me a unique take on le. My we, when we met, didn’t even know who Tyrone Power was, so she was unfazed.”  Belfast   Most Read#Heartbroken# Lynda Bryans to orce MLA Mike NesbittRow over same-sex wedding ultimatum letter sent to NI churchesFather of boy killed by bomb angry as MP whose former party #defended# IRA given peerageIan Paisley prays for Sinn Fein chief Michelle O#Neill and hails Martin McGuinness for respect he showed to his dadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Three weeks without Covid- death,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Banks didn#t want to know people like us because my father was unemployed, same as the majority of men in this city  years ago, but the credit union would lend money to anybody who was a regular saver.I heard an interview John Hume was giving years and years ago and whoever he was talking to asked him what he considered his greatest achievement and John said it was starting the credit union in Derry.I just thought that showed the calibre of the man John Hume was, he cared so much about the ordinary working class man in the street.Before his illness took a real hold of him, John would walk around these streets and everybody knew he wasn#t well but they looked out for him, made sure he was okay.John Hume helped Derry#s people through their most dficult days.

It is no exaggeration to say that each and every one of us now lives in the Ireland Hume imagined - an island at peace and free to decide its own destiny.This is an historic moment on this island but most of all it is a moment of deep, deep sadness. In the days ahead, Ireland will be united in mourning his loss. However amidst that national mourning, it is equally true that the marking of John#s death also opens up a space to reflect on, and celebrate, the magnitude of his le. As part of that reflection of John#s work, never has the beatitude rung truer - blessed be the peacemakers. The le of John Hume will forever be a blessing upon this island since Ireland is now blessed by the peace he gted to us all. It is the greatest legacy a political leader can bestow upon his country.Hume will always find a home amongst the pantheon of great Irish leaders and it is only right and natural that he will now be spoken of in the very same breath as O#Connell and Parnell. It is important that John#s endeavours are fully appreciated in terms of their sheer scale - his impact and legacy extends well beyond one letime and well beyond the confines of Northern Ireland. His le#s work brought to an end the seemingly intractable historical arc of bitter conflict between the neighbouring islands of Britain and Ireland. After some  years which inflicted so much hurt and harm on all our peoples, it is John Hume who must now be remembered as the great healer of that history. For all of these reasons and more, John Hume truly was Ireland#s greatest. Whilst John Hume lived most of his adult le at the centre of modern Irish history and its politics, it is important that we remember that for John#s family, he was the very centre of their lives and of their love. The Irish nation has lost a giant of its history but his family have lost a husband, a father and a grandfather. The thoughts, prayers and love of all the SDLP family are today with the entire Hume family - with his children Terese, Aine, Aidan, John and Mo, his brothers and sisters and all his grandchildren. Most especially our thoughts are with his loving we Pat who cared for and carried alongside John the very same burdens over many dark and dficult years. It is especially poignant that John#s death has occurred as we concluded celebrations of the th anniversary of the Civil Rights Movement, a time which first awakened his political journey. Witnessing the enflamed streets of the s and a community determined to rise up and put an end to the systematic discrimination of the state, John chose to build a politics and a political party which was true to its time and true to the aspirations and the needs of our people. The Good Friday Agreement, embraced and endorsed by the Irish people in , is the institutional embodiment of that creed and its vision. John was not simply the Agreement#s architect or its builder, he was very much both. He will forever remain its enduring inspiration. As part of our reflection, a special mention is appropriate for the city that was always so special to John Hume. Today, Derry is a city shrouded in grief. John Hume once summed up his political philosophy in saying, #I never thought in terms of being a leader. I thought very simply in terms of helping people.# The simplicity of that statement remains a powerful insight into the patriotic devotion that came to define the man. Having spent his le in the service of others, no-one is more deserving of the eternal rest which now awaits him.

The retained version of the regulation, and the subject of this consultation, will apply in Great Britain only, the paper stated.It is unclear what impact the new rules will have on businesses and customers, with potential iations in consumer demand and the circumstances of inidual manufacturers. Earlier this year, however, the UK#s car lobby group, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders , warned that some carmakers could pulled models from sale as a result of the regulations.“[Carmakers] will have to look at their model mix … you’ve got to see whether that’s economic. The fines are going to be severe and all of them will do everything they can to avoid that, SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said.“It could be that you see a reduction in consumer choice through the removal of higher-emitting vehicles from not just the top end, but particular segments.”Belfast Most Read#Heartbroken# Lynda Bryans to orce MLA Mike NesbittRow over same-sex wedding ultimatum letter sent to NI churchesFather of boy killed by bomb angry as MP whose former party #defended# IRA given peerageIan Paisley prays for Sinn Fein chief Michelle O#Neill and hails Martin McGuinness for respect he showed to his dadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Three weeks without Covid- death,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Every news agency in Europe mourns his death and John Hume#s name will join the list of great Irish leaders for posterity.And yet, for many people under , there may not be the true understanding of his le#s work that he deserves.John#s extended illness took him from the public space for too long. It would be a fitting tributethe global response to his death prompted a new examination of his le.Such was his towering contribution to Irish society, that it may well be impossible to properly express the scale and signicance of his work.In a dark and worsening conflict, where sectarianism, hatred and bitterness threatened to banish forever the hope of better days, John Hume stood as a beacon. His philosophy was simple but revolutionary. He understood and distilled the roots of a conflict that had blighted our country and our relationship with Britain for centuries.With single-minded determination he promoted that philosophy relentlessly.Respect for dference, the importance of shared institutions, the three strands of relationships - within Northern Ireland, between North and South and between East and West, the primacy of human rights to these political foundation stones that are now almost universally accepted without question, John Hume taught us the way.To his core, John believed in the dignity of every human being.It was what propelled him into community activism. It saw him become a driving force in the Credit Union movement, working to break the cycle of poverty and exploitation in Derry and across the North.Understanding at first hand the importance of education in improving le prospects, he was a lelong champion of education.He loved Derry from the bottom of his heart and Derry loved him. No matter where his work took him, he never lost his connection with his home place.And as the situation got worse, he looked farther and farther afield for help.He knew we couldn#t fix the mess we were in on our own and he built an international coalition of interested parties that was unprecedented in scope and influence. In the United States and in Europe, he brought the Irish conflict to the very top table and gave everyone a stake in finding peace.To this day, the deep affection and support that Ireland enjoys in Brussels and Washington DC is in part a legacy of the work of John Hume.He didn#t do it on his own.His successor as SDLP leader and MP for Foyle, Colum Eastwood put it well when paying tribute on Monday. He said #There was no John Hume without Pat Hume#.This is true.Pat#s dedication and support during his active career and her unfailing care during his retirement and ill health is central to his story and his success.In a very real way, John Hume saved this country. He saved us from a descent into hopelessness and hatred.He saved us from a conflict that had held us back for centuries.Ten years ago, the Irish people recognised this when they voted him #Ireland#s Greatest# in an RTÉ series of that name.It was a fitting tribute.When historians stand back and survey the long arc of Anglo Irish relations, when they see how close we came to the abyss in the s and s, and when they look at what this man did and how his philosophy transformed relationships, I am confident that #Ireland#s Greatest# is also a tribute that will stand the test of time.Micheal Martin is Taoiseach  Belfast   Most Read#Heartbroken# Lynda Bryans to orce MLA Mike NesbittRow over same-sex wedding ultimatum letter sent to NI churchesFather of boy killed by bomb angry as MP whose former party #defended# IRA given peerageIan Paisley prays for Sinn Fein chief Michelle O#Neill and hails Martin McGuinness for respect he showed to his dadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Three weeks without Covid- death,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

On July , , Ray Cossum set off from France to swim across the English Channel. He completed the journey non-stop in a time of  hours  minutes. In doing so, he became the first Irishman to officially swim across the channel. It had been a long-held ambition for Ray. Born in Folkestone on the south coast of England in , he grew up hearing stories of people who had swam across the channel. It was an ambition he would come back to later in his adventurous le. googletag.cmd.push Ray served in the Royal Nay for eight years, five of which were in the submarine service as an escape instructor. While he was in the Navy, he was based in Derry where he met and married Bridie Loughrey, before the couple set up home and raised a family in Creggan. His love of long-distance swimming was developed and honed in the waters of Lough Swilly in Donegal where he regularly swam between Buncrana and Rathmullan. After much preparation, he decided to take his efforts to another level by attempting the channel swim he had heard so much about when growing up. googletag.cmd.push However, it was not an easy thing to achieve. He tried unsuccessfully twice to complete the swim. However, he finally realised his dream in the summer of . Almost  hours after leaving France, on July , , Ray made it back on to land near his home town of Folkstone. “I had tried to so the swim a couple of times before and on one of those times I was just a couple of miles from finishing it when I had to stop because of gale force winds,” he said. “So it was great to finally manage to swim across the channel and it was a big relief after all the training I had put in.” As a result of his success in , the local man became involved in the Channel Swimming Association which is the official body which regulates channel swims. He later went on to become vice president of the association. He remains proud of his achievement  years ago and the special relationship he has with the Englisn Channel. “I can say that I have worked as a er on the bottom of the English Channel, I have swum the channel, I was vice president of the Channel Swimming Association, I have passed through the channel in submarines, I have been through the Channel Tunnel, I have flown over the channel and passed over the channel on ships,” he said. “So I can say that I have see the channel from every angle possible.” Ray is also well-known locally for his deep-sea ing exploits. In , he bought the rights to the wreck of the SS Laurentic which sank on January ,  after striking a mine at the mouth of Lough Swilly. There were  passengers on-board the ship. Of these,  people died and only  survived. After the Laurentic sank, the Royal Navy organised a huge amount of es over subsequent decades to recover a large number of gold bars which were worth an estimated poundm in . Since buying the rights to the wreck, Ray has organised a large number of es to what remains of the vessel and had also been heavily in preserving artefacts which have been salvaged from it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Louise Campbells song Everywhere was written in March just before lockdown and recorded in her home studio in the Waterside. The single was been picked up by both Christian radio station, UCB Ireland, and Derrys Drive . And it has now been accepted to the Indie Folk Acoustic section of the UK Christian Chart  A Step Fwd, which unlike traditional charts works on an online voting system. To even have it accepted was amazing, said Louise. There are some really big established names in my category. So evenit doesnt place its great just to have that recognition. googletag.cmd.push Louise is also part of Irish music collective Wired Worship which has  members from across the North West from dferent Christian backgrounds. Although she has been involved in music from a young age, Louise had lost confidence in her singing and songwriting. But after starting to write Christian music just over a year ago, she feels she has found her voice again. I write Christian music that everyone can listen to, explained Louise. A lot of my songs are about struggling with mental health and finding acceptance and being OK with who you are. People who arent religious in any way have told me that my songs have spoken to them. googletag.cmd.push Louise is a member of All Saints Clooney, Church of Ireland church on the Limavady Road and she had recently explored the possibility of becoming an ordained minister. She was disappointed not to get through the selection process, but instead of feeling it was a rejection she now sees it as a sign that music is the right path for her. I have sung from when I was a child and dreamed of being a singer for my whole le, she said. But I had lost my confidence and I hadnt written in years. Once I started writing about my own experiences I just couldnt stop. My songs are about relatable, real experiences as a broken person who doesnt have it all together all the time. Louise is hoping to release her debut album Stumble Into Grace at the end of the year and she is funding its production by selling handcrafted items online. She has set up a crafting station in a cabin in her back garden from which she creates hand made art. I have been painting, sewing and woodburning, she said. I love to take old junk and make something beautul. Pre-lockdown, Louise was very busy with her two kids and volunteer work but after being forced to shield due to severe asthma she suddenly found herself with lots of spare time. I loved it, she said. Ive never had this amount of time to do the stuff I want to want to do, rather than the stuff I have to do. So a lot of good has come out of it, although Id like it to be under better circumstances. Louise has set up a Facebook page dedicated to her music and art and a  member strong Facebook prayer group. Im an outgoing person but Im also a complete introvert, said Louise. But now I feel like Ive got all these people behind me shoving me off the bus. Ive come to see that my own fears and insecurities arent a good enough reason not to do what Im being called to do. You can find out more about Louise at her Facebook Page Lousie Campbell-Stumbling into Grace. Louises song Everywhere is on Wired Worships album Hear which is available on iTunes, Spoty and Amazon music.

He pulled off a coup by adding Tyrone coach Gavin Devlin to a management team that includes his cousin Seamus Bradley and long-serving player Padriacuteg Kelly, who has also spent time as a senior selector. Coleraine ended their hopes for five-in-a-row and they were beaten by neighbours Glen in last years semi-final. His new captain Karl McKaigue could be set for a y spell on the sidelines after an Achilles injury in Sundays hurling victory over Ballinascreen. googletag.cmd.push Padraig Cassidy was hampered with injury during the county season, but apart from McKaigues injury the Slaughtneil boss reported a full hand to select from. He has been handed a defensive boost. Paul McNeill has ed after a troublesome shoulder injury, while there is also ato full fitness of goalkeeper Antoacutein McMullan and the versatile Barry McGuigan has emerged from retirement. Former winning captains Patsy Bradley and Francis McEldowney continue to squeeze every last drop from their stellar careers. They open their account against a Kilrea side, who are in their second season under manager Declan Bradley. The Pearses will look to the experience of Brian Oacuteg McAlary, James and Charlie Kielt to lead their youthful side, who are looking to build over the next five seasons from their recent minor winning team, who were pipped in the U final. googletag.cmd.push Larry Kielt is back in training after a cruciate ligament injury, but this first game may come too soon for his . Brian Oacuteg McAlaryand Peadar McLaughlinwill need assessed this week before Bradley makes his selection. In attack Daithi McLaughlin has been a ray of light for Kilrea and he will need support from Paddy Quigg. Three players pushing for the team are Daniel Madden, PJ McAleese and Odhran McLarnon. It is a tough opener for them and its hard to see them turning over an Emmets team looking to launch a title bid.

Kevin Brady, who played a cameo junior football role for Ogra Colmcille two seasons ago, has joined him after helping St Marys Magherafelt to MacRory Cup success. Other than a game with St Eunans, Bradley has tried in vain to get any more challenge games to put any stamp on his side, which has kept the same personnel as recent seasons. Paul Young will miss the game due to work commitments in England, while defender Connor McVey and Roddy OKane are struggling with injury. On the plus side, Derry player Jason Rocks is on his way back and could see action by the end of the group stages. googletag.cmd.push Bellaghy have John McKeever at the helm this season, who has Leo Meenan in as coach with former minor selector Kieran Glackin on board and provides a vital link to the upcoming talents from their underage production line. With goalkeeper Benny Diamond stepping aside, one of McKeevers first tasks was to find a replacement. Former Derry minor list Peter Stuart, who is an accomplished kicker, has been moulded into the role and is set to start against Loup. The Tones, under Chairman Kevin Doherty, followed the lockdown to the letter of the law, but got a few challenge games in to help prepare them. googletag.cmd.push Conan Brown hasnt came out this year and another player who wont feature is Conor Quinn, who has suffered a nasty knee injury. Lorcan Spier will miss the first two games with a suspension carried over from last season. McKeever will need to keep captain Eoghan Brown fit, who will form a partnership with the highly rated Paul Cassidy, their Ulster minor winning captain, who has recovered from injury. Along with Ronan McFaul, Odhran Lee and Conan Milne, they could be set to make their debuts in a youthful Bellaghy team, who will look to Gerard ONeill and Ryan McNally, with Peter Cassidy and Declan Brown also having championship experience.

It was a year to remember for the club who also cleaned up at underage and they have since added to their squad. Jack Bartons transfer saga from Moneymore saw him join Magherafelt. There was afor former players Ryan Ferris and Peter Quinn, who played for Thomas Davis in last years Dublin final. googletag.cmd.push They have a fourth addition in the form of Michael McEvoy, who missed last years winning run with injury. Selector Paul Quinn stated that it was dficult to get games and their meeting with Swatragh was their only outing. Surprising Paddy Power has the champions at a staggering   to retain their title and it is something Adrian Cush will certainly use to his advantage to fire up his side to again silence the doubters. Ballinderry have brothers Niall and James Conway as joint managers, with former goalkeeper Michael Conlan as team trainer. The Shamrocks pushed Kilcoo to the pin of their collar in the Ulster league final last season and picked up momentum going into the championship before Gareth McKinless injury ended their hopes of having a proper cut at Slaughtneil. googletag.cmd.push He is back fitter than ever, but his brother Daniel, who gave Karl McKaigue a testing time last season, hobbled off in a challenge game with Derrylaughan and Niall has ruled him out for the rest of the season. Ironically Conways nephew Sean Graham scored - in the game, but after being released from English soccer outfit Blackpool, he is going on trial with Crystal Palace and wont be available. It leaves Ballinderry, famed for their attacking prowess, reliant on Ryan Bell for scores up front against a Rossa team who mastered their counter-attacking game.

The Bridge played Kilrea and Steelstown to finalise their preparations, getting away from the in-house scenarios to embed the new rules in the minds. Like many clubs, training has been well attended and Conlan cant ask much more from his squad, who he feels have an exciting future ahead. Michael ONeill remains between the posts, with their defence built around skipper Nathan Rocks, who has had his injury problems, and brothers Paudi and Conor McGrogan. googletag.cmd.push At midfield, Michael Bateson and Conor Doherty are the likely pairing. They will have Peter and Mark McGrogan in an attack that also includes Jude Diamond and Danny Mulholland. Another option will be Conor McAteer, who had an impressive school season with St Pius and will be looking to push on. Conlan and selector Ryan McElhone will have a familiar face along the line in Ballinderry man Philip Muldoon, who coaches Foreglen under manager Damian OConnor. They wont be able to call on Shane and Ruairi Duffy. The brothers both travelled home from London all through last years championship campaign, but have remained with Fulham Irish this season. googletag.cmd.push Foreglen, one of the clubs to suspend their activities due to the Covid- scare, ed to training last Tuesday. They also played Steelstown and Limavady, but have been hit with injuries worries. Muldoon, who says the they are going to throw the shackles off and play without pressure, ruled out Conrad Sheerin with a hamstring injury. There are doubts over Ciaraacuten McFeelyand John Duffy . On the clubs young guns Liam Downey is an exciting prospect his is nursing a hamstring injury. Newbridges greater  depth should see them begin the season with a win.

An Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft was dispatched and two Irish naval ships placed on standby after the skipper of the Killybegs-based fishing vessel, the Marliona, reported that a UK frigate ordered him to leave the area where he was fishing  miles off the Irish coast. It is understood that HMS Lancaster hailed the fishing vessel on Tuesday morning, informing the skipper they were commencing a joint operation with a submarine which would continue over the next three days. A maritime aircraft was sent to monitor the area where the UK warship was operating and two Irish naval vessels were redeployed. googletag.cmd.push The Marliona has since resumed fishing in the area which is west off Tory Island. Sinn Feacutein spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and Defence John Brady accused the British Navy of arrogance of the highest order and of once again endangering Irish fishing vessels. Deputy Brady said: “On one level, we have the outrageous scenario of a foreign power ordering an Irish vessel out of Irish waters. On the other, we have a situation where a British warship was engaged in a joint operation with a British submarine. The disregard for Irish sovereignty is arrogance of the highest order. But, alongside this we have the endangerment of Irish fishing vessels and their crews by a British submarine. googletag.cmd.push I thought that we had left this carry-on behind with the Cold War. For decades, British submarines have infringed on Irish sovereign waters, leading to tragedy and loss of le when submarines have got caught up in fishing nets and pulled trawlers under. It is staggering and unacceptable that this flagrant disregard for the safety of Irish fishing crews is continuing. This cannot be allowed to stand. I will ensure that this incident will not be allowed to be swept under the carpet.We need answers as to why this has been allowed to happen. I understand that the Department of Foreign Affairs has launched an investigation into the incident, and I will be in contact with the Minister to ensure that the governments response reflects the seriousness of the matter.  I also want to commend the response of the Irish Navy, which ordered Irish vessels to the area to ensure the safety of the fishing vessel in question. This incident underlines theneed to end the running down of the country’s defence forces and naval service by government.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, as revealed recently by Derry Now - https:bit.ly DiqvOu-with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The test site has now moved to the Lycra car rarkin Maydown. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. googletag.cmd.push These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. googletag.cmd.push “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They say that this will build on the excellent work already begun by the North West Greenway Network team in conjunction with Derry City  Strabane District Council, and will play a major role in the economic regeneration of the towns and villages along the routes, such as Carrigans, Castlefinn, Lford, Clonmany, Ballylfin, Carndonagh and Quigleys Point. The specic allocations are as follows Inishowen Greenway - Section: Buncrana to Carndonagh Section googletag.cmd.push Allocation for   -€,. Inishowen Greenway - Section: Muff to Quigley’s Point Section Allocation for   - €,. Carrigans to Castlefinn Greenway - Section: link between Castlefin and the Foyle Valley Greenway. Allocation for   - €,.  With more people riding bikes and walking with the onset of the Covid pandemic, this type of infrastructure will also help to promote physical fitness, improve mental health and reduce our carbon emissions. Donegal County Council is very proactive with its partners to address all of these issues and this funding will make it safer to cycle and walk in our county. Going forward, the council will consider potential route options and will engage in a consultation process, similar to the process that is delivering the greenway connections from Buncrana to Derry and Muff to Derry respectively. googletag.cmd.push All these routes tie in with other strategic council projects, most notably the EU-funded Riverine and North West Greenway Network projects. While all of Donegal’s applications to DTTaS were not successful, the council is currently progressing its greenway and cycling strategy, and central to this strategy will be the routes outlined above as well as the planning of greenways linking Ballybofey to Donegal town and Letterkenny to Burtonport. It is proposed to bring this draft strategy before members later this year. With national government committed to spending % of the total transport capital budget for cycling projects and an allocation of % of the total capital budget for pedestrian infrastructure, the council is optimistic that many of our countywide projects – including the Barnesmore Gap and Burtonport greenways – will be advanced in the coming years.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A construction company, HartlandsLtd, and Apex Housing Assocation had applied to build  houses at a large site at Springtown Road. However, planning officers recommended that the application be refused because the site was outside the current limit for housing developments as outlined in the Derry Area Plan. Planners said thatgranted planning permission, the new houses would set an undesirable precedent in terms of housing development in the countryside. The final decision on the application, however, rested with the members of Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee. googletag.cmd.push The planning application was discussed for almost two hours at a special meeting of the planning committee on Wednesday. Maura Fox, Head of Planning at the council, said she could not underestimate the signicance of the decision being made in relation to the Springtown plans. During the meeting, speaking on behalf of those behind the housing proposal, Daniel McAteer, described the Derry Area Plan as being hopelessly out of date and out of touch. He said the new houses would help to meet the critical need for social housing in the city. SDLP councillor John Boyle said he was worried about the sustainability of further development in the Springtown Road area, given the large number of houses which have been built in there in recent years. googletag.cmd.push He said there was already a high volume of traffic in the area and more housing would increase this problem. People Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin said he recognised the desperate need for housing in the city but highlighted the concerns around creating a precedent in what was zoned as a rural area. Sinn Fein councillor Aileen Mellon said the new houses would help tackle the housing crisis in the city. When the issue was put to a vote, four councillors voted to support the recommendation to refuse planning permission, while three councillors voted against the recommendation.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The former Chester and Maidenhead forward, who missed the defeat to Sligo Rovers at the weekend, opened the scoring at the start of the second half, after which captain Conor McCormack sealed the points with his first goal for the club in over four years. This was a much-improved Derry City display as they showed more hunger and desire and ultimately more threat against a St. Pat’s team who thoroughly disappointed. googletag.cmd.push Declan Devine made three changes to the team which wilted against Sligo Rovers, Colm Horgan and Jack Malone starting, whilst James Akintunde made his Candystripes debut. For St. Pat’s, there was a debut for former City player and recent target Georgie Kelly, with the hosts looking to build on their impressive performance and result against Dundalk. There was a lively start from both teams with Robbie Benson bringing a good save from Pater Cherrie with an effort from  yards, before Gerardo Bruna tested Brendan Clarke from a similar distance. At the other end, all eyes were on Akintunde on his debut and whilst the first  minutes passed him by, he was heavily involved in creating a chance for his team when he worked his way in from the right before finding Conor McCormack, who set up Joe Thomson for a curling -yard shot which just ailed wide of Brendan Clarke’s upright. googletag.cmd.push Walter Figueira came even closer just minutes later, collecting the ball  yards from goal before trying an ambitious effort which had Clarke scrambling across his goal before it flashed just wide of the post. The second half began perfectly for Derry City who took the lead with their first serious attack. Colm Horgan did well to bring the ball down the right and he fed the supporting Jack Malone, who placed a low cross into the heart of the penalty area where James Akintunde was on hand to direct the ball past Clarke and into the net for a debut goal. The next goal in this one was so important and it went the way of the visitors who punished a St. Pat’s mistake ruthlessly. Luke McNally gave the ball away deep in his own half and Figueira latched onto it before driving towards goal. The City playmaker got in the vicinity of the Pat’s area before leaving it for Conor McCormack, the midfielder skilfully curling the ball around Brendan Clarke and into the corner from  yards to double his team’s lead with just over  minutes remaining. City held firm in the closing stages to give them three very valuable points ahead of the weekend game against league leaders Shamrock Rovers. Teams ST. PATRICK’S ATHLETIC: Clarke, Titov , Desmond, McNally, Feely, Grfin, Benson, Gibson , Lennon , Ward , Kelly .  DERRY CITY: Cherrie, Horgan, Toal, Gilchrist, Coll, Malone , Thomson, McCormack, Bruna , Figueira, Akintunde .

He said the business has been in existence since , with the amount of birds at the site remaining the same.Mr Shields said the proposal is for a ldquomodern, environmentally friendly unit and explained that he finds himself in the ldquoridiculous situation where he is trying to reduce emissions from his site by  per cent.He said this is a figure which the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs agrees with, but planners are recommending that his proposal is refused, even though it is a government target to reduce emissions.ldquoWe are looking to create efficiencies on our farm so that we will be ableto market all our eggs locally, rather than rely on the wholesale market in England where the majority of our eggs are sent, he said in the letter to planners.ldquoThis new system would give signicant benefits locally in both environmental and economic terms. Ammonia levels would be reduced by up to  percent and we would be looking to employ extra people to help with the grading of eggs and deliver them locally.Mr Shields said that he can continue with the older system which will emit a lot more ammonia, which is something that the government is trying to reduce..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Shrigley children’s sports pitches due for repair scheme  ","story":"CHILDRENrsquoS sports pitches in Shrigley are to be upgraded.Confirmation that Newry, Mourne and Down Council has agreed to carry out the work has been welcomed by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown.He has been lobbying for the upgrade in response to residentsrsquo concerns and is pleased that the football pitches used by young people who live in the village will be improved.Cllr Brown said that an existing boundary fence will be increased in height alongside the provision of additional netting to prevents stray footballs from ending up in neighbouring gardens.ldquoGoalposts will be painted and holes in the ground fixed as part of a general revamp to improve playing conditions, he said.ldquoFurthermore, no ball games will be allowed in the play park itself and new signage will be erected to reflect this.Cllr Brown said he was pleased that the local authority is open to improving the conditions of the pitch and also the additional measures to protect local houses.ldquoEspecially over summer, it is important for the younger members of our community to have adequate outdoor facilities where they can take part in sporting activities, he said.The Rowallane councillor added: ldquoI hope that the improved fence offers residents peace of mind as their properties and cars will no longer be subject to stray footballs.

Wersquore very lucky to have it and should make every effort to keep it going.Another resident described confirmation that the facility will not reopen this summer as ldquosuch a shame.She added: ldquoAs the only al open air sea pool left in Northern Ireland the Rock Pool ought to be celebrated and included in Discover Northern Irelandrsquos tourism landmark buildings and locations information. It should also be publicised in the Outdoor Swimmer Magazine.A council spokeswoman confirmed that the council took a decision to close all seasonal facilities in Newcastle, including both outdoor pools, due to Covid-.She said the decision was considered in the councilrsquos emergency business plan tabled at the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee meeting on June  and ratied at the full council meeting last month.In relation to the reopening of the indoor swimming pool at the Down Leisure Centre, the spokeswoman said the local authority was currently considering recent announcements by the Northern Ireland Executive on the reopening of pools and health suites and in relation to spectators at outdoor facilities.She added: ldquoAt present, these facilities remain closed until further notice.ldquoThe council is taking a phased approach to the reopening of its leisure facilities to ensure the safety of both staff and customers.

I was either three or four. My brother Garrett is a year younger than me. We moved from Strangford to Downpatrick when I was four-and-a-half and it was before that.My father had taken the two of us to watch a football match. Other than my mother, perhaps his five favourite things in le were reading, the crossword, conversation, a cup of tea and watching a game.What he wasnrsquot always great at was keeping a close eye on children in his charge. Between watching his old club play and chatting to a couple of the other men on the sideline, he didnrsquot notice Garrett and I making a sprint on to the pitch, looking for a go with the ball.It could well be that memory through the efflux of time has us causing greater disruption that night than actually was the case. In some ways I hope that our presence wasnrsquot even noticed by the players. It would be awful were that to have been the biggest influence that I ever had on a football match, although there is every chance that my high point was that warm evening in Kilclief.Unfortunately my enthusiasm for sport was not matched by aptitude. On one visit to his cousins in Listowel I was being encouraged to eat up my black pudding with the Kerry exhortation that I wouldnrsquot play football for Down without a good diet of black pudding.If only it had been that easy. The biggest problem was an unreliability and inconsistency in a ballrsquos direction of flight after it had been propelled by my foot, hand or implement. Allied to being short-sighted before my teens and having a slight frame, the portents werenrsquot good.Football was the game in the Red High and there were plenty of good footballers about. Kevan Owens, Ciaran McCabe and Patrick Kielty were in my year. Brian Burns the year behind. John Kielty the year ahead with Conor Deegan, Barry Breen, Mark McCartan and John Kelly a few years ahead.The recently-deceased Bro Charles was teaching in the school until my fourth year and every day hersquod put out a tea chest of hurleys for a lunchtime puck-about, which I often took advantage of. Bro Charles also coached a Downpatrick team and under his patient tutelage, and presumably need for numbers, I reached my sporting apogee with an East Down U-frac medal.What I did get from my father was the love of watching sport and going to matches. He brought me to Croke Park for the first time when I was six. It was the  football final. I was mesmerised by the colour and the noise. I know that Dublin beat Armagh that day but I honestly donrsquot remember that.What I do remember is that, for my only time, our seats were in the Ard Comhairle box. And they were soft seats. And I remember Down winning the minor match and them being given a big silver cup and I remember Daddy holding me up in his arms so that I could see it and it being so close that I tried to reach out and touch it.But it wasnrsquot all glamour. I still have yet to feel as baltic as I did one winter Sunday standing on a grass bank in the Marshes at about the age of eight or nine with the cold spreading from the frozen turf through the soles of my shoes and up my legs and Daddy talking and talking and talking as I futilely tried to will him back to the car and the warmth of home.Happier times included a spring and summer of going to watch club hurling matches. He was a member, along with Paddy OrsquoDonoghue I think, of a commission on the future of hurling in Down for the County Board and there were many trips to games, particularly to the Ards.As much as he loved football, in truth hurling was his real passion. Due maybe to a Waterford father. As a young man he had hurled for Kilclief and the county. Nothing better than a good game of hurling, hersquod say. Particularly one played in fair conditions on a firm pitch. He never got to the Munster final as often as he would have liked, but that was considered one of the great highlights of any sporting year.What we did get to and what from a young age what I was lucky enough to have as a highlight were the September trips to Croke Park for the hurling and football finals. Particularly the football finals. I got to see the great Kerry-Dublin battles, Kerryrsquos four-in-a-row, Kerryrsquos three-in-a-row.With a Kerry grandmother I felt some affinity to that great team. The Spillanes, Jack OrsquoShea, Paacuteidiacute Oacute Seacute, Mikey Sheehy, Bomber Liston, Ogie Moran, Charlie Nelligan. Great men. As magnicent as the modern Croke Park is, part of me will always miss the old wooden benches of the Hogan Stand.But there were green shoots beginning to appear with Downrsquos Minor All-Ireland in  followed by a narrow loss to Meath, my county of residence these last  years and more, in the  National League final. Preludes of course to theof the good old days and Downrsquos second era of greatness.I have never been at a more momentous sporting occasion than the  final.  comes close obviously, but doesnrsquot match it for the sheer joy, relief and euphoria.That match in Celtic Park is another contender. I suspect that had I been in Istanbul in  it might also have come close. I was in Cardf when Leinster came back from the dead with  unanswered second half points to win their second Heineken Cup. That too was an extraordinary day. But rsquo was in a league of its own.Those men of Kerry were heroes. But heroes in the same way as Kenny Dalglish, Alan Hansen and John Barnes were heroes. Itrsquos a very dferent thing when the heroes are your own people. The excitement building for weeks before. My father calling in favours from all over the country to secure extra tickets. He could nearly have opened a ticket agency.My seat that day was near the back of the Upper Cusack, two seats along from Paddy Doherty. Afterwards we made our way across the pitch and out on to Jonesrsquos Road to meet up with everyone  for the chat. At some ungodly hour on the Monday night the bus finally arrived into Downpatrick and the great Pete McGrath said that we beat the team that couldnrsquot be beaten.The last time that I went to Croke Park with my father was his last visit, three-and-a-half months before he died. It was the hurling final between his fatherrsquos county of Waterford and Galway.He had been there in  and  when they had won their two All-Irelands. He had spent childhood holidays with cousins near Dungarvan, which is where he had learnt to speak Irish. In  he had a lt by horse and cart into Tramore for the train to Dublin to watch the match.His lungs werenrsquot great at that point and I think he had greater clarity than the rest of us about how long was left. He had said to me one evening in France the month before, ldquoYou know that this is going to do for me. I knew it was, but I thought there was still a good bit leftto go.It was  years since he had brought me that first time to Croke Park when we saw Down win an All-Ireland. It would have been nice symmetry had Waterford won on his last visit but it wasnrsquot to be. The day still finished with him standing chatting to friends on Jonesrsquos Road for as long as he was able. I was happy to have been with him on that last trip.At some point in the lsquos my father stopped driving. He was probably happier with the greater opportunity for the crossword or the newspaper. My mother drove him about, but often therersquod be a lt to a match, usually with Joe Leonard. I think he went to more matches with Joe in his last couple of decades than with everyone  combined.We had started going on holidays to France in the lsquos and by the mid lsquos, by which time he had retired as Ombudsman , he and my mother were spending most of the summer there. They loved itbut,there was one downside, he missed a lot of football and hurling.Initially he relied on match reports by telephone from any of us still in Ireland. The urgency of the reports eased as his access to the internet grew but he still appreciated a call at some point to be told how the match had actually gone.The real salvation though was when their great friends, the McQuaids from Dungannon, started to come on holidays to the next town. That in itself was a good thing, but the real boon was Jimrsquos technical wizardry and ability to use a satellite dish to get RTEacute. Thereafter Jim and Maurice spent many Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons watching Jimrsquos television.I donrsquot know when I first knew of the great feats of the lsquos. I donrsquot ever remember not knowing. Whether it was the flag that my mother kept in the house with ldquoUp Down stitched across it that she had made for one of her brothers in  that my brothers and I loved to take out and wave in the garden.Or my fatherrsquos watch that had been given to him by Brian McCartan and Charlie Carr, which was engraved ldquoTo Maurice Hayes, Secretary of the Down All Ireland Football Team . From B. and C., which fascinated us as children. A watch he wore for the rest of his le and which I am wearing now as I write this.That watch made it clear that this had been something of very great import. I often think of James McCartanrsquos story of meeting his father on Jonesrsquos Road after the  final. His father was in floods of tears and said to him, ldquoYou kept your promise.The names were as familiar as our own. The McCartans and the OrsquoNeills. Paddy Doherty, Joe Lennon, Kevin Mussen, Jarlath Carey, Leo Murphy, Eddie McKay, Tony Hadden, George Lavery, Breen Morgan, Pat Rice, Patsy OrsquoHagan, PJ McElroy, John Smith and Kieran Denvir along with names like John Murphy, Peter Rooney, Larry Powell, Danny Kelly, Ray McConville, Jim Milligan and the great Colm McAlarney from later in the decade.As a boy, when people heard that I was a Hayes, Irsquod at times be askedI was Mauricersquos son and then told that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland but for him. And when Irsquod ask him about it hersquod say that Down wouldnrsquot have won an All-Ireland without the players, that hersquod never kicked a ball.He spent the best part of six decades holding those men in the highest esteem, as footballers, as people, and as friends. His view was that every one of them had lived constructive lives in which they had contributed to their families, their communities and to society.And for all their achievements, they were modest men. Paddy Doherty recently selected his best Down team of all time for the Down Recorder. He didnrsquot pick himself. Paddy lsquoMorsquo is the only person in the entire country that wouldnrsquot have Paddy lsquoMorsquo on that team.Above all, he loved their company. He loved meeting up with them over the years at matches and ious s. Usually wearing his Club Down tie. Part of the pleasure of going to a match was the half-time cup of tea and the chat with friends afterwards, whether on Jonesrsquos Road, in Newry or whatever ground the match was in.There are two photographs from the GAA Congress in Newcastle ten years ago that show it well. One is a formal photograph with President McAleese and ious dignitaries. Hersquos sitting at the bottom left deep in conversation with Kevin Mussen.In the other, therersquos a group standing on a set of steps. Hersquos at the back having a chat with James McCartan. I think that Bobbie Hanvey was one of the only people that could get him to look into a camera.A third photograph from that Congress showed him standing in front of the huge poster of the  team calling them ldquoThe History Makers. That photograph was used on his memorial card. When it came to his funeral, he was buried in his Club Down tie. Nothing  would have been appropriate.His last visitor before he died was Dr Walsh, who held his hand and chatted to him. Their last words together were, ldquoWe had good times. They certainly did.This article was originally published on the Club Down website..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11608202.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Please try again later.Submitting...Respectful tributes have been paid to former SDLP leader John Hume from unionists, nationalists, world leaders and othersHe said that the former civil rights activist “will always find a home amongst the pantheon of great Irish leaders and it is only right and natural that he will now be spoken of in the very same breath as O’Connell and Parnell”.Former US President Bill Clinton said that Mr Hume had “fought his long war for peace” with the weapons of “an unshakeable commitment to non-violence, persistence, kindness and love”.Mr Hume’s death comes just six months after that of fellow Good Friday architect and long-time SDLP deputy leader Seamus Mallon, a man with whom he had a complicated and at times tempestuous relationship.The former SDLP leader’s passing was announced yesterday morning in a statement from his family who said that he had died after “a short illness”. They thanked the “exceptional” staff at Owen Mor nursing home and “the people of Derry and Moville Greencastle, who have looked after John and shown us so much kindness as his dementia has progressed. Celebrating community in all its ersity went to the heart of John’s political ethos and we are very appreciative that our communities supported, respected and protected John.”The family said that Mr Hume’s funeral would be “arranged according to the current government regulations with very strict rules on numbers”, meaning that “many will be unable to join us” and so a later memorial service would be held.Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the former SDLP leader as a “political giant”, while Taoiseach Micheal Martin said he was a “great hero and a true peacemaker”.First Minister Arlene Foster described the man who led the SDLP for  years as “a giant figure in Irish nationalism, but also in the wider le of Northern Ireland”.She said that “even those of us who will have dfered in our constitutional preference cannot fail to have admired and respected his drive and desire for a better future”.Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said that Mr Hume was “a hugely important figure in our political history and a driving force in the Good Friday Agreement”.Former Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams said: “His decision to meet with me in September , following an invitation from Fr Alex Reid, was a breakthrough moment in Irish politics.”Lord Trimble said that he still viewed the Hume-Adams talks – which enraged not just most unionists, but also some senior SDLP figures – as “misconceived” and something which “appears – although one can’t be sure of it, because we don’t know exactly what was said [as] an attempt to bypass the democratic process”.However, he said there was a “positive outcome in that the governments took over”, putting in place a framework for negotiations which would ultimately see republicans accept huge ideological changes such as the principle of consent.He said that when the violence which became the Troubles began and as Mr Hume was leading marches for civil rights, most unionists “would have viewed this as a policing issue” and wanted the authorities “to suppress this civil disorder”.He added: “It wasn’t until later that people began to see that that was not an adequate explanation of the problems.”Lord Trimble went on: “One thing that you have to give him credit for is that he very clearly set his face against violence, right from the very outset...Hume was very clear, right from the outset, that violence was not the way of solving problems.”Lord Trimble said that Mr Hume had “limitations”, especially in that “he was a west bank [of the Foyle] nationalist who had very little contact with unionism - very little contact with unionism or Protestantism. He did not understand [them].”However, referring to the lessons which today’s leaders could learn from Mr Hume, Lord Trimble said: “One goes back to the very clear commitment to peaceful means, and to a democratic process.“He used a lot of words about the situation, but basically it comes down to something that’s founded on the democratic process and that’s a positive thing.“It would be a mistake for unionism today, in the aftermath of Hume’s death, to be anything other than recognising his positive contribution.”Yesterday there were warm tributes from across the political spectrum. Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken said: “John Hume’s huge contribution to political le in Northern Ireland is unarguable, even by those who would have regarded themselves as political opponents.“Throughout the long dark decades of the Troubles, John Hume consistently offered constitutionalism nationalism, a peaceful alternative to the violent republicanism of the IRA, which he recognised was utterly futile.”Alliance leader Naomi Long said: “Without the hard work and sacrice of people like John Hume, we would not live in the Northern Ireland we do today.”Former Prime Minister Tony Blair said Mr Hume was a “political titan” and “a visionary who refused to believe the future had to be the same as the past”.His predecessor, Sir John Major, said: “Few others invested such time and energy to this search and few sought to change entrenched attitudes with such fierce determination.”He added: “He has earned himself an honoured place in Irish history.”Irish President Michael D Higgins said Mr Hume had transformed and remodelled politics in Ireland.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable.

The firm already has a link with the council, collecting recycling from homes in the Armagh area.Eric Randall, Director at Bryson Recycling says: “We are delighted that the Council is considering the Wheelie Box option. Collected weekly, the latest Wheelie Box model will offer % more capacity than a standard green recycling bin.This is an image of what can be put in the Wheelie Boxes.“Wheelie Boxes are a very much enhanced version of the kerbside boxes which are already in use in the Armagh area. The boxes have a lockable hinged lid and are integrated onto a trolley with wheels, which makes them secure and very easy to use and move.“As well as providing more space for recycling, Wheelie Boxes will also mean good news for local jobs because % of what we collect using this approach is recycled in Northern Ireland. This compares to typically around % using green bins.”Wheelie Boxes are not new, , households in Northern Ireland already use them.Bryson Recycling also pointed out that two firms based in the borough, Huhtamaki and Cherry Pipes, used recyclable materials.A number of dferent systems are currently in operation across the Borough and the consultation aims to introduce a single, streamlined recycling system from next year.Eric adds: “The Wheelie Box option means local households can increase the amount they recycle every week instead of fortnightly, protect local jobs, boost the economy and play an important role in creating a local, sustainable environment for all.”To voice your opinion, check out the link on the ABC Council website here https:www.armaghbanbridgecraigavon.gov.uk green-bin-or-wheelie-box-choose-which-to-use "},{"url":null,"title":"autumn date set opening new south lake leisure centre ","story":"Air ambulance takes motorcyclist to hospital after serious RTCSadness as funeral of popular Co Armagh woman takes place todayNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPeopleAutumn date set for opening of new South Lake Leisure CentreA date has been set for the opening of the new south lake leisure centre in Craigavon with the multi-million-pound facility to open its doors on November .By The NewsroomTuesday, th July , : pmUpdated Tuesday, th July , : pm\"\"The largest capital project to date undertaken by ABC Council, and among the largest in Northern Ireland, the new multi-use sports and leisure complex is described by the council as a major new flagship health and wellbeing destination.Work on the facility was halted by the coronavirus outbreak.
