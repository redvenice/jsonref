(Picture Getty)Fifty-six million years ago, the Earth warmed far above the temperatures we experience today – and ice at the poles melted.It sounds like the kind of crackpot conspiracy to be found on ‘ancient alien’ UFO sites, but scientists have seriously investigated the idea.Professor Adam Frank of the University of Rochester writes in The Atlantic that the investigation could offer insight into how to find alien life – or about our impact on our planet.Frank writes, ‘There is a conundrum here. If an earlier species’s industrial activity is short-lived, we might not be able to easily see it.‘The PETM’s spikes mostly show us the Earth’s timescales for responding to whatever caused it, not necessarily the timescale of the cause.Could we be one of several civilisations to have lived on Earth? (Picture Getty)‘So it might take both dedicated and novel detection methods to find evidence of a truly short-lived event in ancient sediments. In other words, if you’re not explicitly looking for it, you might not see it.’Frank says the researchers thought about what our civilisation might leave behind in rocks for future civilisations to find – plastics in the ocean, evidence of fertiliser use, and (most of all) evidence of fossil fuel use.Frank says that civilisations might – through their collapse – trigger the conditions to create more fossil fuels, for future civilisations to use.Frank says, ‘Our work also opened up the speculative possibility that some planets might have fossil-fuel-driven cycles of civilization building and collapse. If a civilization uses fossil fuels, the climate change they trigger can lead to a large decrease in ocean oxygen levels."},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_7621136.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"wetherspoon close 900 pubs head offices social media accounts trolling","story":"The company feels that social media does little to enhance the businessJD Wetherspoon is closing down its Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts for all its 900 pubs and head office with immediate effect following the trolling of MPs and others.The pub chain said the move also takes account of recent concerns over the misuse of personal data and the addictive nature of social media.‘I don’t believe that closing these accounts will affect our business whatsoever, and this is the overwhelming view of our pub managers.‘It’s becoming increasingly obvious that people spend too much time on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, and struggle to control the compulsion.‘We will still be as vocal as ever through our Wetherspoon News magazine, as well as keeping the press updated at all times.Wetherspoon has more than 44,000 Twitter followers and more than 100,000 followers on Facebook.Its most popular posts have received more than 500,000 views."},{"url":null,"title":"When Kate Middleton birth","story":"    Kate, Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s third pregnancy was confirmed by Kensington Palace in 2017When did Kate announce her pregnancy?Kate’s pregnancy was confirmed by Kensington Palace in September 2017 in a statement that said: ‘Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to announce that the Duchess of Cambridge is expecting their third child.\u0027The Duchess was forced to make the announcement early after suffering from severe morning sickness, otherwise known as hyperemesis gravidarum, as she did during her first two pregnancies.After taking a short hiatus from public engagements, Kate returned to royal duties at the start of 2018 and sported her bump visiting west London’s Reach Academy Feltham that works with the children’s mental health charity Place2Be.

The ceiling had rotted out above my bunk bed, which meant the drainage from a bathtub was leaking onto me. I survived on power bars that my dad would send me, he\u0027d smuggle them into me through the lining of a case, which was stuffed with them.\u0027I had to constantly clean asbestos and pipes damaged in the boiler room, situated in the tunnels underneath the LA headquarters. There were three boilers the size of two-story houses, then five or six smaller ones, all completely wrapped in asbestos. I was only 16 years old and working on eight-inch steel pipes, welding thousands of yards of steel pipes at that age, it was absurdly dangerous.\u0027After one year at RPF in LA, I got transferred to finish off at Flag. I was remodeling a lot of the hotel rooms, but then was handpicked to make all the specialty furniture for Cruise\u0027s penthouse.\u0027To this day, Cruise, 55, still has his own suite on the top-floor of the Scientology-owned Osceola Inn, which is dedicated to his own personal taste.Tighe says: \u0027On every other floor at the Osceola, there were seven or eight hotel rooms, but he had the whole floor. It was British colonial style. There were two four-poster beds, all African mahogany, hand made plantation-style shutters 8ft tall.           At 12 years old Tighe (pictured in 2005) signed a billion-year contract with the Sea Org and endured 18-hour days of hard labor and studying  Brendan was punished and sent to the Rehabilitation Project Force (RPF) - a Scientology prison - and forced to do hard labor           After one year at RPF in LA, Tighe was transferred to finish off at Flag and then was handpicked to make all the specialty furniture for Cruise\u0027s penthouse (pictured) \u0027Built-in, custom-made, floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, two giant 8ft by 12ft wide entertainment systems and bead-board ceilings. They\u0027d also put up special satellite dishes for his TV. The penthouse had triple the amount of cameras than anywhere else, often disguised as smoke alarms.\u0027After Tighe had finished RPF in 2002, he was approached by the deputy security chief who gave him a position at The Sandcastle, a Church-owned hotel mostly used by public Scientologists, who were visiting Clearwater HQ for courses and auditing, and Scientology VIPs.The Sandcastle security control room, where Brendan worked, monitored most areas where Scientology VIPs studied and lived, including Travolta and Cruise\u0027s personal quarters. From 2004, Brendan became the head of security at The Sandcastle until he left five years later.The Top Gun actor would often stay for months at a time, along with his huge entourage, and complete the \u0027Operating Thetan Levels\u0027, the highest of Church studies.\u0027I wasn\u0027t his personal bodyguard, that was a guy called Algar, but for seven years in a row, I was doing his security detail, such as guarding him when he walked down the street and would be checking all the cameras in his living area. I was a top priority with the dentist, I always had to have my teeth whitened and regular check ups. You had to have a good smile for Tom Cruise,\u0027 says Tighe.\u0027Five of us were ordered to get gun licenses out of 47 security, we\u0027d have a gun strapped to our legs, it was specifically for Cruise and Miscavige. It was amped up when the protester group called Anonymous started in the early 2000s.\u0027In all those years, I think he said hi to me three times, even though I\u0027d be in the hotel every single day. When you see him glad-handing everyone in videos, he never did that at Flag, he kept to himself. Even if he was on a course with 200 people, he\u0027d have a three-person security buffer from anyone.     Brendan doing security at an International Association of Scientology Gala circa 2007          Sea Org Day in 2005           Flag Building, the global headquarters for Scientology in Clearwater, Florida\u0027You\u0027d hear that he would travel to obscure Scientology Orgs and shake their hands, but it\u0027s just photo occasions, he\u0027s not like that. He had to have everything private, every detail. I found that odd.\u0027His routine would be - wake up, gym for an hour, then breakfast of all kinds of \u0027shakes, lots of food and protein, all sent to his room by his personal chef, who was one of my close friends called Nico. He just liked bacon and eggs and protein shakes. Then he\u0027d gym again before the day is out. When he would go to exercise, he would want the entire gym wing all to himself.\u0027He\u0027d then go to study, including auditing sessions and refresher courses, he\u0027d be constantly in the classroom. Cruise was a perfectionist and would hang around for several weeks even after being allowed to go, as he wanted more auditing, more courses.\u0027It was beneath Cruise to have his own hotel card, so we had to make sure that he could go through all these doors and they would open and close perfectly. There\u0027s hundreds of doors, with magnetic locks and punch codes. If it took him 30 seconds to go down a hallway, no one else was allowed to use it, same with any public areas and even the urinals. If anything was out of place, like someone had pissed on the floor, Cruise would tell the security. Sometimes it would get back to Miscavige, then someone would really be in trouble.\u0027He had his own private jet so he could go in and out without anyone seeing, Miscavige also got granted use of it. We\u0027d know weeks, if not months, in advance if he was coming, he never just popped in for a day or two.\u0027There were times where he\u0027d have to do movie reshoots during his coursework, but he\u0027d be straight back, or they\u0027d even do it locally very secretly, where directors and producers would meet him at Flag. All his movies fitted around Scientology. The only person he did have time for is Miscavige, and the pair would ride around Clearwater on their motorbikes or go to the movies.     Brendan had befriended Cruise\u0027s mother Mary Lee, who converted in the mid 2000s           While working as the PR officer for a fundraising unit he invited Mary Lee to an awards banquet. Above is her thank you letter to Tighe          Invitation to Brendan to start the Operating Thetan Level 2 - there are eight levels in Scientology, which followers study and it costs a lot of money\u0027When I witnessed it for the first time, I thought I was going to have a heart attack, they were putting on their motorbike gear on a public street, in full view of everyone. They\u0027d then drive to the movies, which they\u0027d do a lot, I don\u0027t know how no one ever noticed them. They\u0027d then ride back, talk for an hour by the road, then go their separate ways,\u0027 says Tighe.\u0027Cruise emulates Miscavige in every way.\u0027But it was his relationship with children Isabella and Connor which stuck with Tighe. Nothing got in the way of his studies, family was second to Scientology, The kids would even stay in different lodgings.\u0027Although he was at the Osceola, he\u0027d rent a few rooms at The Sandcastle for his staff, Isabella and Connor, and their teachers and caretakers. I never, ever saw him with his kids apart from one time in 2007 when it was his birthday on the 4th of July. I don\u0027t want to paint a bleak picture, but I was watching hundreds of cameras and I never saw them with him. They\u0027d even be making faces into the cameras.\u0027 \u0027They would be taken to amusement parks, do schooling in their hotel rooms. I heard staff talk about how they constantly had to make sure that the kids were on Cruise\u0027s side. By the mid-2000s, Cruise, who came from a strict Catholic upbringing in Louisville, Kentucky, had converted his mother Mary Lee to Scientology, and his three sisters - Cass, Marian and Lee Ann - they were all working for him in some capacity.          Cruise is the only one with a \u0027direct line\u0027 to leader David Miscavige (pictured), Tighe claims \u0027Cruise\u0027s mom was always there at Flag, she was a lovely woman, we would talk for hours sometimes, she was so nice. His mom always remembered my name. I would feel safer talking to her when Cruise wasn\u0027t in town, I wouldn\u0027t want to get caught by him. \u0027She was getting lots and lots of auditing and was very happy about it, she was so proud of her son, she was the sweetest woman in the world. My take on it was that he was still a mommy\u0027s boy, but his sisters were under his thumb.\u0027After I left security in 2009, I was the PR officer for a fundraising unit and organized an awards banquet and show. Mary Lee was personally invited by me and sent me a thank you letter.\u0027The two-sided letter said: \u0027Beings of this universe, The entertainment was great, the food was great, the table decor was great could have danced all night. Much love, Mary Lee South.\u0027Yet Tighe tells a different story about his sisters and Cruise\u0027s attitude to them. \u0027He wanted all his sisters and their children at the same super high level as him, being super dedicated Scientologists and not dragging him down in anyway. \u0027They would work for him either in management or housekeeping, but, in talking to his family, it was always about making him happy.\u0027Nothing was left to chance with Cruise and when he orced from Nicole Kidman in 2001, it was leader Miscavige\u0027s chief aim to find him a girlfriend.          Tighe said he had met church member Kirstie Alley several times. He also claims to have helped Kelly Preston get a birthday gift for TravoltaTighe would also accidentally get the reports on Cruise\u0027s latest brainwaves, who would then make handler Davis fire off a note to Miscavige. In a Scientology promo video from 2008, Cruise was interviewed about what the Church means to him, and he\u0027s seen laughing on camera. The clip went viral and Tighe says Cruise wanted the clip played continuously on Scientology TV, which he wanted created just for him.\u0027Tommy would get slapped around for the littlest thing that Cruise was not happy about. Tommy was the buffer between Cruise and Miscavige, Miscavige would never directly deny any Cruise\u0027s requests, but usually they\u0027d go through Tommy, who\u0027d then have to handle it delicately,\u0027 says Tighe.\u0027For example, after he got the Freedom Medal, in one of the reports, it said that Cruise wanted to create a TV network on Scientology. He was so pumped up about his medal that he wanted them to create a video of the ceremony, then play it 247 on some new channel he wanted. \u0027He wanted the full interview, the one where he\u0027s laughing his a** off, on the TV network, he thought it was the best thing ever.

San Francisco does have a 420 code, but it refers to ‘juvenile disturbance’, a tenuous connection at best. The California penal code does have a 420 section, but it refers to the unlawful prevention or obstruction of a person from entering public land.As for the births and deaths of musical luminaries: Bob Marley died on May 11 Joplin died in October Morrison in July Hendrix in September. Even the chemical composition for cannabis is out, coming in at 483 known compounds.          There are many theories regarding the provenance of the term 420 including that it\u0027s the police code for \u0027marijuana smoking in progress\u0027, though most have been debunkedHowever, that is not to say the most legitimate-sounding provenance is disappointing or in any way less delightful than the theories above.The term 420, quite appositely, is thought to have been created by a group of high school students looking to arrange a time to meet up, smoke marijuana and search for plot of land grow more of the cannabis plant.According to High Times, the cannabis magazine, in 1971 five students at the San Rafael High School in California decided to meet every day at 4.20pm to smoke marijuana by the school’s statue of Louis Pasteur. The password for the meeting was ‘420 Louis’. The five students called themselves ‘the Waldos’. The magazine then says the term faded into obscurity only to gloriously be brought back by a connection to the Grateful Dead band, at whose shows mysterious 420 flyers began popping up.In 1998, High Times officially declared the Waldos as the true creators of the term 420.Cannabis laws in the UKCannabis in the UK is classified as a Class B drug, alongside amphetamines like speed and certain opioids.People stopped for possession of cannabis for the first time get a written warning. A second offence may result in an on-the-spot fine while a third stop will result in an arrest.The maximum penalty for possession of cannabis is up to five years in prison, an unlimited fine or both.          Though recreational cannabis isn\u0027t legal in the UK, many people smoke it in Hyde Park on 420Cannabis laws in the USThe tide against smoking of marijuana is slowly turning in the US. The drug was first legalised for recreational use in the US in 2012 with Colorado and Washington states.As of April 2018, nine states and Washington DC have legalised recreational use of marijuana: California, Nevada, Maine, Massachusetts, Alaska, Colorado, Oregon, Washington, and Vermont. Over half of all US states allow marijuana for medicinal use.Cannabis in AustraliaRecreational use of marijuana in Australia is currently illegal. If someone is caught in possession of marijuana, the punishments they face range from on-the-spot-fines to being charged with a criminal offence or even being sentenced to prison, depending on what state they are in. However, the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes is legal. In April 2018, the Federal Health Minister, Greg Hunt said: ‘Faster access, better access … there will be a one-stop shop for accessing medicinal cannabis,’.When is Kate Middleton due to give birth? Birthing rules Kate Middleton must follow when the latest royal baby is bornPatrick Melrose: All you need to know about Benedict Cumberbatch\u0027s new show Britain\u0027s Got Talent 2018 Spoilers: Acts to watchHow to watch Beyonce at CoachellaCannes Film Festival 2018: Everything you need to knowBritain\u0027s Got Talent 2018: Everything you need to knowACM Awards 2018: All you need to know about the country music awardsWhat is 420 and when is \u0027weed day\u0027?Sting and Shaggy album 44876 is comingLost in Space Netflix series: Everything you need to know"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/15/10/4B14CE4600000578-5617539-image-m-2_1523784441050.jpg","title":"Meghans family left dark royal wedding invite","story":"    A 19-year-old Meghan Markle is pictured on her paternal grandmother Doris\u0027s 85th birthday in Florida, USA           Meghan Markle on her high school graduation day, accompanied by her father Thomas MarkleOne of Meghan\u0027s uncles reportedly said: \u0027I talked to Thomas last week and he didn\u0027t seem to know what the problem was.\u0027He told me he hasn\u0027t heard anything and he didn\u0027t even know if he would be walking Meghan down the aisle.\u0027 The newspaper says the family are waiting to find out if the \u0027controversial behaviour\u0027 of some of Meghan\u0027s relatives has left them frozen out of the wedding. Meghan\u0027s nephew is a CANNABIS farmer who is planning a new...Did Meghan and her ex split up over a pasta dish?

Unity and a common cause are ‘paramount to the beliefs’ of the hairless space explorer, he told devoted RemainersThis was the converted preaching to the converted, a ticket-only event in which any Brexiteer foolhardy enough to heckle would have been silenced by a phaser blast, Vulcan death grip – or a tut from the ladies of ‘Bath for Europe’ (in EU-blue berets with gold stars).‘Since the 2016 referendum,’ Sir Patrick said, ‘there has been a concerted effort by many –including government – to shut down debate and to tell us that we should simply trust ministers to get on with it because Brexit is an irreversible process – that we shouldn’t worry about the cost and complexity of it, or the litany of broken promises. Well, today we say that’s not good enough. Our country’s future is at stake and we will not stand idly by.’The People’s Vote campaign hopes to head off Britain’s departure from the EU next year. It calls on Parliament to give the public a vote on the terms of the final deal, with the chance to remain in the EU if they vote against it.Burning green pellets is ‘filthier than using coal’…and...Price of scampi may rise because catches of scampi tails...Share this articleThe £1million campaign brings together nine grassroots organisations, and is fronted by those giants of politics, Tory MP Anna Soubry and Labour’s Chuka Umunna.Stewart, 77, is no stranger to parallel universes, being both a star traveller and mutant professor Charles Xavier in the X-Men Hollywood films. ‘It is not Charles Xavier standing here in front of you, although I can assure you that if he was he would have voted Remain,’ he said, thus imposing political views on a second fictional character.He said Picard would have felt the same way, adding that the character believed ‘in the common interest’ and ‘always had at heart the needs of everyone, not just an elitist few’.The day Britain joined the then European Economic Community on January 1, 1973, was one of the best of his life, Sir Patrick said, adding that he would carry his blue British passport with less pride that the burgundy EU one. ‘Now that we are learning the real cost of Brexit, I want to urge that we think again,’ he added.There were plenty of hysterical pro-Brussels figures in attendance. Former EU commissioner Lord Mandelson and ex-Blair favourite Lord Adonis were purring at this clunking celebrity intervention.

Green MP Caroline Lucas, Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, Labour MP Chuka Umunna, Conservative MP Anna Soubry and comedian Andy Parsons pictured at a rally to launch People\u0027s Vote - a campaign demanding a vote on the final Brexit deal, With Parliament expected to debate the terms of a settlement in the autumn, the motley crowd that has come together as the People’s Vote has little time to reverse opinion.They certainly won’t change the minds of the hardy group of Brexiteers who stood outside yesterday. ‘Newsflash: Remain Lost!’ read one of their placards, reminding Remainers entering the venue that the British public had already had its say, and there is no justification for a re-run. ‘I voted to leave the EU, but only started to campaign actively after people who dared to declare they voted Leave were accused of being racist,’ said Lucy Harris, 27, of the London For Leave group.Arch-Brexiteer Sir Bill Cash MP, chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, accused the fledgling group of attempting to sabotage the referendum result. ‘They are defying the British people, who made a decision given to them by Parliament itself.’ The group’s new publicity push comes as peers prepare to force the Prime Minister to reconsider Brexit via a series of votes in the House of Lords. One amendment could make the UK remain in the EU customs union. This would make it impossible to agree trade deals around the world.Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, an architect of the Leave victory, dismissed Sir Patrick’s remarks, saying the UK would ‘boldly go’ into areas of the world it has neglected.When Andrew Marr suggested on his BBC1 show yesterday that British trade negotiators might be confronted by ‘alien spacecraft waiting to zap us’ in these far-flung places, the Foreign Secretary assured him that they were ‘friendly, wonderful places where we can renew old friendships, rebuild relationships and develop fantastic new free-trade deals’.In any case, Brexiteers have little to fear from the intrepid Captain Picard. He is not due to be born for another 287 years (date of birth July 13, 2305), although there is no guarantee that diehard Remoaners won’t still be arguing about Brexit even then."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/14/00/4B22331600000578-0-image-m-27_1523663646017.jpg","title":"The security services knew British diplomat Donald Maclean betrayed country","story":"    At the start of 1951, Donald Maclean\u0027s (pictured with his wife) name was cropping up on lists of suspects as \u0027Homer\u0027, the mole in the British embassy in Washington who during and after the war had leaked state secrets to the Soviet UnionBut the threat of exposure was a concern and a disturbed Maclean started to binge-drink again. It made him reckless. He got into a silly alcoholic argument at a party and burst out: \u0027I\u0027m a member of the Communist Party — have been for years!\u0027This wasn\u0027t even true. He\u0027d never been a party member, not even in his radical Left-wing days at Cambridge. It was a pointlessly dangerous thing to say that might incriminate him.But when it was reported to the Foreign Office and the security services, they declared that it was \u0027obviously not to be taken seriously\u0027. It was all put down to the drink talking.Maclean, the highly respected head of the Foreign Office\u0027s American Department, with a glittering career already and tipped for even greater eminence in the future, was not considered in any sense a liability — even when, at another party, he drunkenly shouted at one of his oldest friends, \u0027I\u0027m a Communist agent\u0027, and challenged him to report it.The spy who beat his wife: The tall, charming and...Pin-point destruction: Satellite images reveal how Syrian...Share this articlePhilby, however, was alert to the danger. When he heard of this outburst, he could see that his comrade\u0027s days were drastically numbered, and he contacted Moscow for instructions on how to get him out.He then briefed his fellow spy and Cambridge recruit, Guy Burgess, to warn Maclean that he was going to be rumbled any day, and to set up an escape plan.Meanwhile, the spy-catchers were getting closer as they eliminated other suspects. To the incredulity of George Carey-Foster, head of Foreign Office security, the spotlight was shifting to Maclean.Carey-Foster found it hard to believe that such a trusted friend and colleague could really be the guilty party, yet the evidence increasingly pointed to him. An appalled Foreign Office had to accept that Maclean — the brilliant man many of them had expected to run the show as Permanent Secretary one day, the star they had hitched themselves to and protected, had to be Homer.          In May 1951, Maclean left the house (pictured) on SurreyKent border and travelled to France with fellow spy Guy Burgess before defecting to the Soviet UnionThey were paralysed with indecision about how precisely to bring him in. They were also too embarrassed to name Maclean, one of their own, to the Americans.The only action agreed at this point was to put a tap on his phone and a tail on his movements. His mother\u0027s phone was also tapped, as was the one in the consulting room of the psychoanalyst he was seeing about his alcoholism.But a decision was made to hold off actually doing anything more until either concrete evidence could be obtained that would hold up in court or the suspect could be interrogated and confess. During this window of official inactivity, the most senior spy ever detected inside the British government was, amazingly, allowed to go about his business unhindered.He lunched with old friends in the respectable establishment surroundings of the Garrick, Army and Navy and Travellers clubs. He had tea in the office. And, all the while, the watchers from MI5\u0027s surveillance unit, A4, loitered on street corners and silently followed him.Maclean himself must have suspected his nemesis was getting closer. Sensitive files were being kept from him his superiors seemed awkward around him there was the echo of the tap on his telephone.Clearly, he was worried. An old acquaintance he ran into thought him shabby and morose, \u0027untalkative, with his hands thrust deep into his tweed coat pockets and his shoulders hunched\u0027. He seemed defeated, exhausted by the worlds which he had strived to straddle for so long.Elsewhere in London, Burgess was in crisis talks with Anthony Blunt, another highly placed Cambridge alumnus working for the Soviet Union, who was embedded in MI5.          Kim Philby, the wily undercover master-spy who had recruited Maclean as a Soviet agent, briefed his fellow spy and Cambridge recruit, Guy Burgess (pictured), to warn Maclean that he was going to be rumbled any day, and to set up an escape planBlunt passed a message to Moscow that if Maclean was arrested and questioned, he would almost certainly blab, putting the whole network in danger.So far, Moscow had hesitated about getting Maclean out: now the instruction came back: \u0027We agree to your organising Maclean\u0027s defection. We will receive him here.\u0027Burgess met Maclean for a drink at the Reform Club, where he told him that MI5 were onto to him. Maclean wasn\u0027t surprised. \u0027I\u0027m being followed by the dicks,\u0027 he said, pointing out two men in the street jingling their coins in a policeman-like manner. \u0027I\u0027m expecting a summons any day.\u0027But he was reluctant to defect, abandoning his wife Melinda and his family, especially since she was pregnant. The word came back from Moscow: he had no choice.Philby then sent a coded message telling them there was no time to lose. Get on with it.For the next few days, Maclean found it in himself to act normally. He renewed his railway season ticket and left his trousers at the dry-cleaner\u0027s for collection.In terms of escape plans, it helped that the watchers from MI5 chose not to follow him in the evenings or at weekends. Their presence in the Home Counties village where he lived would be too obvious. They saw him off from Victoria each night, then headed home.From Moscow came a new order: that Burgess, increasingly a liability because of his own excessive behaviour, would not only help Maclean to \u0027exfiltrate\u0027 but go with him for at least some of the way.The problem was how to get the two of them out, given that it was a safe bet the airports and ports would be watched. Moscow toyed with \u0027that classic spy-novel device, a submarine appearing at a discreet rendezvous somewhere along the coast\u0027, but time was too short.          Donald Maclean with his wife Melinda Marling and his two sons Ronald and Fergus in the 50sIt was Blunt who came up with the solution. There were cruise ships that left the Channel ports on a Friday night, then put in for brief stops for meals and shopping in France and the Channel Islands before returning on Sunday evening. As passengers were deemed not really ever to leave Britain, passport checks were virtually non-existent.Thursday, May 24, was another frantic day at the top of the Foreign Office, with furtive high-level meetings that ended in still more dithering about Maclean\u0027s guilt. They were still very cautious about condemning such a trusted colleague — and there was also the political consideration that managing how they broke the news to their opposite numbers in America was crucial.Not to tell them would be a breach of their intelligence-sharing protocols but nor did they want the story, which would be a sensation, to leak.A timetable was drawn up to put off his interrogation for a month, partly to give them time to deal with their opposite numbers in the U.S., and partly because Melinda was due to give birth on June 17, enabling them to search their house, if necessary, while she was in the nursing home.The next day — Maclean\u0027s 38th birthday — he went to work as usual and rang his mother to invite her for lunch. She had a previous engagement, she told him, and couldn\u0027t make it. She was never to see him again.He lunched with old friends instead — champagne and oysters at Wheelers in Soho — but was \u0027steady on his feet\u0027, according to the watcher tailing him when he went through the Foreign Office doors for the last time at 3pm.As he left that evening, he told colleagues he wouldn\u0027t be in for a few days because \u0027something has cropped up\u0027 . That left Sir Roger Makins, the deputy under-secretary, suspicious. He was in the know about Maclean and rang the head of security to alert him.But there was no reply and, running late for a social engagement, he concluded that, as Maclean was under surveillance by the Security Service, there was no need to raise the alarm.No one in the Foreign Office had been told the surveillance teams knocked off when Maclean took his train home. The team\u0027s last sighting of him was recorded as \u0027after a drink, he boarded the 6.10 pm train for the Whitsun Bank Holiday\u0027.And, officially, that was the last that was ever seen of him.At home that evening, the family dined on a special ham Melinda had spent the day preparing, and birthday cake. To Melinda\u0027s annoyance, a man she did not know arrived, introduced as \u0027Roger Styles\u0027. It was Guy Burgess.Dinner was a chatty, \u0027normal\u0027 meal, with no one showing any sign of strain. Afterwards, Maclean went upstairs and packed a double-handled Gladstone bag because, he told her, the two of them had to go away on business. He might be away a night or two.

They fled to safety through an upstairs passageway leading to their newsagents shop in Waterfoot, Lancashire.The couple, who are President and President Elect of Rossendale Rotary Club, later discovered their employee Hitchin was behind the fire after he was spotted on CCTV.Hitchin, of Newchurch, had been telling fellow villagers he \u0027hated\u0027 the Watts after they were obliged to declare his cash in hand payment to benefits officials.He was jailed for three and a half years after he admitted arson being reckless as to whether life would be endangered at Burnley Crown Court.          Hitchins tried to torch the home of Adrian Watts and his wife Caroline after developing a grudge against them following the benefits cutIn a statement to police Mr Watts, a grandfather who has run the newsagents store since 1985 said: \u0027One of the most upsetting details was finding out Neil was telling people in the local community how much he hated us. It has taken us four weeks to get our house back to a liveable state and we are exhausted.\u0027There have been some nights where I have dreamt of being trapped in a burning building. \u0027Had they not had smoke alarms then the outcome could have been a whole lot worse.

He did a good job, he worked seven days a week and we increased his wage when he had to pay tax.\u0027We did everything we could for him. At the time I would never have said it was Neil, I didn\u0027t think that he had that sort of spite in him.\u0027You just can\u0027t compute how somebody could do that to you. We used to get on really well. I was just incredulous and disbelieving. But the fact is he had a grudge while he was still working for us. If we hadn\u0027t had a smoke alarm we wouldn\u0027t be here now.\u0027  The couple who were targeted said they couldn\u0027t believe Hitchin had become so consumed by the pay issue. Left: Victims Adrian and Caroline Watts and his wife. Right: Mr WattsThe court heard Hitchin had been employed by Mr Watts for five years, delivering newspapers in the area. He was paid cash in hand for his work.Prosecutor Richard Archer said: \u0027At the same time was claiming benefits and did not declare this. Mr and Mrs Watts properly declared the money they paid their staff through the books and the job centre became aware of his employment. He was interviewed about this and as a result his benefits were reduced.\u0027He continued to work there but felt aggrieved. He spoke to a friend of his and told him of plans to fire bomb the job centre - but commented that he would need to cover his face as there was CCTV. After a while he switched his intentions to the newsagents as he blamed the Watts for his change in circumstances.\u0027This was more a personal vendetta than a commercial one. He didn\u0027t target the newsagents but the house next door where the Watts were sleeping.\u0027          Hitchin had been delivering papers for the newsagents for five years before the arson attackHitchin had a previous 2006 conviction for harassment. His lawyer Anthony Stephenson said in mitigation: \u0027A clear diagnosis of Aspergers Syndrome has been given in this regard. What compounds the circumstances in this case is that this is a man who had formed an almost siege mentality.\u0027He is remorseful and regretful. He never intended to harm but just to scare or frighten. He had formed an incorrect view of his part-time employers and thought they were dead set against him. When he was in drink and at a low ebb he committed the offence for which he stands here today.Sentencing Hitchin, Judge Jonathan Gibson told him: \u0027There was a significant risk of harm because you put accelerator through the letterbox late at night. If the smoke alarm wasn\u0027t working the consequences could have been a lot more severe.\u0027Luckily they managed to get out of the house via a back stair case. There was significant psychological harm when they reflected on what happened. You do have a previous conviction which shows an obsessive type of behaviour.\u0027This offence was committed in drink and was an attack as a result of ill-feeling and more than one person was endangered.Hitchin was also made subject of a lifetime restraining order banning him from contacting Mr and Mrs Watts. He also must not go within 500m of their house or shop unless to pass by on the main road in a moving vehicle."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/16/10/4B35374100000578-5620371-image-m-7_1523872412151.jpg","title":"Battery left charging overnight suddenly explodes shop gets engulfed flames seconds","story":"    A scooter battery sent sparks out while connected to a 13-foot-long cable in a store in China          The battery then exploded and burst into flames, setting 20 boxes of goods on fire instantlyAccording to KanKan News, the fire took place at the back of a delivery shop in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province.The battery first caught on fire at about 3:40am on April 13, video shows. Soon it burst into flames and explodes on the trolley.

Konstantin, from Moscow, said: \u0027So our team has been in many different places - I\u0027d say we have come through both ice and fire, but this trip to Baikonur was the toughest in all the senses of this word.\u0027 Pictured: His team standing at the base of the rocket in Baikonur, with metal platforms rising to the top on either side           The ageing spacecraft are kept in the enormous Baikonur Cosmodrome, which is based in a Russian enclave deep within Kazakhstan\u0027s desert steppe. Baikonur was the world\u0027s first and largest space launch facility, with both Sputnik 1 (the first artificial Earth satellite) and Yuri Gagarin\u0027s Vostok 1 (responsible for the first manned spaceflight) launched from it. Now the facility is home to two shuttles that sit gathering dust after the termination of the Buran Space Program in 1993. Pictured: Two members of the team stand on one of the abandoned craft, which is literally gathering dust           Konstantin said: \u0027I hope our story will be interesting for everyone and I will be invited to work in Roskosmos - I like to photograph spaceships. Also I need to say that as a result of this trip we decided to build our own rocket - which is what we are actively dealing with now. It was a long way ahead - only a little bit shorter than to Paris. There were a lot of interesting things to see (with no tickets, special tours, approvals and so on) and of course adventures.\u0027 Pictured: A small doorway at the spaceport           His five-man team journeyed 15,500 miles in total from their Moscow starting point and had to turn off their headlights to avoid being seen by guards. Konstantin said: \u0027Baikonur is 2500km from Moscow. Going there by car is the cheapest and easiest way. The plan was as easy as the following: using offline maps - we wanted to get by car as close as possible in the desert then leave a car and walk through the sand towards the buildings of cosmodrome\u0027. Pictured: The spaceport, photographed from the long grass on its periphery           Describing his journey, the photographer said: \u0027We didn\u0027t want to be seen from the cosmodrome - that\u0027s why we drove with the lights off, sometimes using portable torches to light the way. But soon the car got stuck and we had to continue walking - we still had about two days before the launch. We were heading towards the biggest workshop on the territory of the cosmodrome.\u0027 Pictured: A rocket they found at the base           Konstantin said he used many of the old buildings to hide from detection. He explained: \u0027All those abandoned buildings were just a perfect place to hide. There were many places not to be noticed or found by the cosmodrome workers\u0027          Two large buildings at the base were photographed at night, with the starry Kazakh desert sky bright overhead. Konstantin described the secret mission as an adventure           During the final leg of the journey - a walk - it was hard to remain hidden, he said, explaining: \u0027It took us about 6 hours to walk 22km - and it was a point when we saw the buildings of the cosmodrome, then we had to move like partisans in order not to be seen and we still had to walk 4-6 km to get to the point.\u0027 Pictured: Their prize, an abandoned shuttle           The team of adventurers also climbed into the space shuttle and took photographs of the cockpit, which contained many of the original dials and toggles           The audacious snaps were taken by Konstantin Kosmodemiansky, a blogger and photographer from Moscow who trekked 17 miles through the desert with his friends in order to capture the bizarre scene          The ageing shuttles reside in a massive spaceport that sits alone, miles from any other settlements.

I just remember thinking that I would never see my daughter again,\u0027 passenger Mercedes Weller said of another incident          Investigators discovered a cotter pin, that holds together essential components necessary for the pilots to fly the plane, was missing (pictured) after a dramatic aborted takeoff\u0027Every stop gap in place to enhance safety to a critical flight control was skipped, bypassed or improperly done,\u0027 the report read.The inspector said it amounted to \u0027careless (and possibly reckless) conduct\u0027 and \u0027deliberate and systemic acts of noncompliance\u0027 with Allegiant\u0027s maintenance procedures and federal aviation rules.\u0027They are clearly a repeat offender that show an unwillingness to admit errors unless it will not cost the company money,\u0027 he wrote.However, the FAA chose to give the company a slap on the wrist and instead work with it to improve procedures and compliance.In a fourth incident from 2015 highlighted by 60 Minutes, a pilot was fired for evacuating a plane when the cabin filled with smoke from one of the engines.In Captain John Kinzer\u0027s letter of termination, Allegiant accused him of ordering an \u0027entirely unwarranted\u0027 evacuation and not \u0027striving to preserve the company\u0027s assets\u0027.           Captain John Kinzer was fired for evacuating a plane when the cabin filled with smoke from one of the engines in a fourth incident in 2015He sued for wrongful dismissal after being unable to get another job as a pilot, with the case to go to court next month.Daniel Wells, a former captain who now heads the pilots union, said the case highlighted how pilots were told to play down incidents and faults.\u0027What I hear from hundreds of conversations with Allegiant pilots, is the management of Allegiant seems to denigrate the pursuit of safety,\u0027 he said. \u0027What I hear from the Allegiant pilots are they get a call from maintenance control,  says: You didn\u0027t write anything up, did you?\u0027Meaning you didn\u0027t notice any maintenance problems on the airplane. And that\u0027s a very clear message to send to pilots that the company is discouraging you from recording maintenance deficiencies.\u0027Other than cutting corners on maintenance and safety, many of the issues are blamed on the airline\u0027s reliance on very old McDonnell Douglas MD-80 planes.          Daniel Wells, a former captain who now heads the pilots union, said pilots were told to play down incidents and faultsThey are decades old, mostly bought cheaply from foreign airlines, and require a lot of maintenance with difficult to source parts, 60 Minutes said.The program noted the number of incidents started to improve recently as the airline replaced several of these planes with newer Airbus A319s and A320s.The small ultra-low-cost carrier in response called the 60 Minutes report \u0027unoriginal and outdated story that bears no resemblance to Allegiant’s operations today\u0027.Allegiant said it was a \u0027false narrative\u0027 and suggestions staff were discouraged from reporting issues was \u0027offensive and defamatory\u0027. Allegiant Air: The Budget Airline flying under the radar - 60 minutes investigation - CBS NewsAn FAA investigation warned of \u0027potential tragedies.\u0027 Officials hid it from the public"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/16/13/4B36B18100000578-5620989-image-m-20_1523882847521.jpg","title":"London beggars filmed using sign hide wad cash passersby","story":"The two beggars were sat in Leicester Square in London when an office worker spotted one of them \u0027counting cash\u0027 as the other shielded her with a signIn the clip one of the beggars can be seen writing on a sign and looking around while the other does something behind it. The unnamed man said: \u0027I recently recorded two  beggars in Central London writing signs to help them beg for money. \u0027But I noticed that they were hiding something while doing this.

Instead, he experienced the USSR primarily as a series of texts that landed on his desk each day. In Stalin’s World: Dictating the Soviet Order, Sarah Davies and James Harris reconstruct his claustrophobic, insular reality through a close study of his archive, shining a spotlight on the daily business of running a massive totalitarian state. It paints a portrait of the dictator as monstrous, paper-shuffling super-bureaucrat.RJB Bosworth takes a very different approach in Mussolini’s Italy. Via an astonishing accumulation of detail, he immerses the reader in a reconstruction of daily life under the fascist dictatorship. The results are surprising: I did not know that a quarter of Italy’s Jewish population were members of the National Fascist Party by the 1930s, nor that Topolino (Mickey Mouse) was regarded as a corrupting influence on Italian youth. And yet Mussolini’s own children read comics starring the American rodent even in Il Duce’s own household, his political experiment was a failure.Stalin’s World is very dense and Mussolini’s Italy is very long – common characteristics of books about dictatorships. Simon Leys’ Chinese Shadows has just over 200 elegantly written pages, and yet cuts to the heart of Mao’s Cultural Revolution with precision. Leys exposed the destructive evil of Mao’s regime at a time when “useful idiots” ranging from Jean-Paul Sartre to Shirley MacLaine were singing its praises in the west. His narrative fuses insights from his own travels in China with profound but lightly worn erudition. One moment Leys is discussing Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse‑tung, the next he is reaching back to its 14th‑century precursor, the Ming Ta kao.Latin America has endured many tyrants, spawning the genre of the dictator novel. Of all the celebrated examples of the form, I am most fascinated by Augusto Roa Bastos’s I, the Supreme. The 1974 novel provides a fictionalised account of the 19th- century Paraguayan dictator José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia y Velasco, AKA Dr Francia, AKA “the Supreme”, who ruled the nation between 1814 and 1840. The Paraguayan author’s interest in the Supreme was not purely historical Bastos wrote the novel while Paraguay was suffering under another dictator, Alfredo Stroessner Matiauda. However, the book is no simple allegory, it is also a profound meditation on power and language.And now for something completely different: Riad Sattouf’s The Arab of the Future. We know personality cults are strange, but that strangeness looks different from the perspective of a child. Sattouf experienced both Gaddafi’s Libya and Hafez al-Assad’s Syria while still a small boy. Kids don’t spend a lot of time reflecting on totalitarianism, but they do form strong impressions. His simple depictions of living in an almost-abandoned building for expatriates in Libya, or of watching Assad praying on TV are the kind of banal micro-details that would lose their significance in written prose. Captured in the panels of a cartoon strip, however, they attain a luminous resonance that lingers long after you’ve finished the book.• Dictator Literature: A History of Despots Through Their Writing by Daniel Kalder is published by Oneworld in the UK and is available in the US as The Infernal Library: On Dictators, the Books They Wrote, and Other Catastrophes of Literacy (Henry Holt)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02b2cc8b9849475587b64eabac332543c3fdc4f2/164_19_1121_673/master/1121.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=18cf7879f8460751e6000101d563802f 1240w","title":"somali british poet momtaza mehri named young peoples laureate for london","story":"The 24-year-old poet, with a background in biochemistry, wants young people in the capital ‘to see poetry as part of their every day’The 24-year-old Somali-British poet Momtaza Mehri, who has been chosen as the new young people’s laureate for London, is hoping to spend her year in the role convincing young people “to see poetry as part of their every day, rather than in some dusty tome, or academic niche interest”.Mehri, who has a background in biochemical science and wrote the poetry chapbook sugah. lump. prayer, has been shortlisted for this year’s Brunel African poetry prize and won last year’s Out-Spoken Page poetry prize. As laureate, Mehri hopes to encourage young people to voice their concerns and experiences through poetry.The poet, from Kilburn in north-west London, was selected for the role by a panel of arts organisations and poets, and is, according to Spread the Word’s chair of trustees Rishi Dastidar, “an inspired choice” and a “poet to watch”.“For young people to have an artist who is an ambassador for them, who brings their concerns, struggles and joys to those in authority, and the wider world, is vital,” Dastidar said. “Her poetry is precise and powerful, and rich with images that are haunting. She is not afraid to tackle the biggest of subjects, which, combined with her talent, is going to give the role a renewed sense of purpose and visibility.”Mehri said she was exposed to oral forms of poetry by her family when growing up, but only began writing for publication around four years ago. “Over time I honed, or found, my voice, and that allowed me to feel comfortable, finding the poetic voice I felt was most suited to me. Obviously at the beginning you’re very much inspired by your influences,” she said. “I think the poetry I write is interested in questions or ideas around disruption or movement, whether it’s movement of people or places, movement between different ideas, between how things change over different generations, and in themes of migration and urban spaces.”During her time in the role, Mehri will be looking to amplify the voices of Londoners aged between 13 and 25, “to let them lead conversations, to be as inspired by them as hopefully they can be inspired by me”. She will work with writer-development agency Spread the Word on youth-focused residencies across London, head a tour to six outer London boroughs, and co-host a special project for young London poets called The Young People’s Poetry Lab.Outgoing young people’s laureate for London, Caleb Femi, said that “poetry has the potential to play a vital part in self-expression and artistic enjoyment in the lives of young people”.“We need a dedicated person who can assist in integrating the joys of poetry into the everydayness of young Londoners,” he added. “We are extremely lucky to have a talented and dedicated poet such as Momtaza Mehri appointed as the new young people’s laureate for London. Her tenure is sure to be an extraordinary one.”Mehri said that she wanted to: “Reach everybody, to allow people to see poetry as part of everyday living in London, and all the different poetry traditions that people bring to London.”“I am very much aware of the fact that I came out of a very different poetic tradition, and what that’s brought to my writing of the English language. So I want to be aware of the fact that people are carrying different poetic influences, whether they consider themselves poets or not,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50df0731d04f515399dca70138e0ed94ba458f78/22_74_1998_1198/master/1998.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=888923474efca65b406214ea7dde4638 1240w","title":"jd wetherspoon closes all social media accounts","story":"Chair Tim Martin reportedly made decision after publicity over trolling of some MPsJD Wetherspoon is closing down all its social media accounts in a move that has been met with widespread scepticism.The pub chain’s decision was reportedly in response to the trolling of some MPs, but many commentators suspected it was a publicity stunt by the chairman, Tim Martin. The company said it was closing down the Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts for its 900 outlets. In a statement announced in a tweet that is no longer available, Martin said: “We are going against conventional wisdom that these platforms are a vital component of a successful business. I don’t believe that closing these accounts will affect our business whatsoever, and this is the overwhelming view of our pub managers.”Martin added: “It’s becoming increasingly obvious that people spend too much time on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, and struggle to control the compulsion. We will still be as vocal as ever through our Wetherspoon News magazine, as well as keeping the press updated at all times.”Martin is said to have taken the decision following recent publicity over the use of social media to criticise MPs and others, especially those from religious or ethnic minorities. However, the chain has failed to attract much of a following online, with just 44,000 followers on Twitter and 100,000 on Facebook. Much of its activity on social media has been devoted to fending off complaints. Martin’s statement said customers could use the Wetherspoon website and app to contact the company, or speak to pub managers.Media commentators predicted the move would backfire. The chain has also been targeted by pro-Europeans for its support of Brexit – Martin was a significant backer of the Vote Leave campaign – with calls from some to boycott its pubs. The company has often had to deal with hoax statements posted on social media. In November last year, the company was forced to refute a claim that staff had been banned from wearing Remembrance Day poppies while at work.Many of its 900 pubs have Facebook pages with fewer than 1,000 likes, meaning that anything they post is unlikely to be seen by users in their news feed. They are, however, still a magnet for bad reviews, which Facebook displays prominently.One pub, which has an overall star rating of 3.7, still has a review section headed “People talk about terrible service”, and both reviews on display are one-star complaints. The company’s corporate HQ location page on Facebook has also attracted one-star reviews, including one in which a customer claims her lost glasses were retrieved from a bin.The company has confirmed that no jobs will be affected by the move."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb4977df3c64b8f5e4e757e1481cefd2d12196ee/0_0_2427_1456/master/2427.jpg?w=1300\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=420ce6a15e495d77d7eec72dcea2bda4 2600w","title":"london fields lido did saving a pool mean losing a community","story":"When campaigners successfully reopened the open-air pool in Hackney, they had no idea it would turn their community into something unrecognisableOne summer day in 2003, the local residents of Hackney, north-east London, were invited on a tour of the abandoned site of London Fields Lido. Although closed since 1988, the pool was not empty. Squatters had moved in, and held raves in the old pool tank – much to the annoyance of campaigners, who had cleaned it up for community events. The tour was to introduce locals to a bold new redevelopment plan for the lido: to reopen the pool, install a cafe and evict the squatters.As the locals were shown around, the squatters sat in front of the changing rooms, where purple buddleia had begun to grow above the doors, and watched them. One woman on the tour, meanwhile, enquired whether she would have to swim if she wanted a coffee. It was a moment that seemed to capture the extremes of life in Hackney: young homeless people facing eviction, and an affluent new resident who saw an opportunity for a latte.Campaigners, however, remember the 18 years spent trying to resurrect it. When the pool closed for refurbishment last year, it stayed closed for four months longer than expected, causing locals to anxiously recall the fate of Haggerston Baths a mile away. The grade-II listed building closed in 2000. Despite a 16-year battle, it did not reopen: an unhappy ending for local campaigners.Indeed, you could write an alternative history of Hackney through the story of its pools. As well as London Fields and Haggerston Baths there was the catastrophe of Clissold Leisure Centre, which cost £45m –nearly seven times the original budget – and closed in 2003 for four years following a flood, just 18 months after it had opened. There is also the furore over Britannia Leisure Centre, which despite a £300,000 facelift in 2016 is to be demolished as part of a major redevelopment that will include a leisure centre with three swimming pools, a school and 480 new homes – only 80 of which will be classed as affordable. Victoria Park was once home to the largest modern lido in London. It was demolished in 1990 to make way for a car park.The closure of pools has been disastrous for Hackney schoolchildren. In 2006, a feasibility study on Haggerston Baths found that four out of the five secondary schools surveyed did not provide any form of swimming, due to lack of funding or facilities. At one point in the mid-noughties there was only one swimming pool with lanes to serve a population of more than 200,000.In the last decade and a half, the gap has grown more visible, as Hackney has become one of the hippest destinations in London, with its chic restaurants, boutiques and cafes. On a hot summer weekend, there are so many people in the park that it looks as if there’s a festival underway. And at the heart of it all is London Fields Lido.Caroline, who serves freshly baked croissants and toasties at a kiosk in the lido, has lived in the neighbourhood for 33 years and has seen the new arrivals flood in. Her flat overlooks the park and she complains about the impact of the crowds – the shortage of toilets and the noise. She regrets the loss of community spirit, and feels that, with rare exceptions, the incomers don’t know how to be good neighbours. ‘I think they’re afraid, they don’t want to mix,” she says. “People walk past you as though you’ve got green wires coming out of your head.”The original Lido is an island beach resort in Venice. It became the popular name for open air pools in the 1930s, bringing continental holiday glamour to gloomy British summers during a boom for building outdoor pools. It was with this ambition that London Fields Lido opened in 1932.As Janet Smith reveals in her very enjoyable history Liquid Assets, the fashion for lido-building was driven by an egalitarian ethos. When Morecambe’s open air pool opened in 1936, Sir Josiah Stamp, a director of the Bank of England, declared: “Bathing reduces rich and poor, high and low, to a common standard of enjoyment and health. When we get down to swimming, we get down to democracy.” London County Council (LCC) was particularly zealous in its lido-building programme. Herbert Morrison, leader of the LCC in the late 30s, wanted London to be a “city of lidos”, with every citizen within walking distance of an open air pool.Margaret Thatcher signalled the end for public swimming with her war on local government spending. London Fields Lido was just one of the many casualties in the 1980s as councils cut their budgets.Mike Martin remembers standing in front of the bulldozer at 7am. He was part of a campaign to save London Fields Lido, which had halted the council’s plans to demolish the pool – but he and his fellow campaigners were then tipped off that the demolition team had somehow not got the message and had turned up to do the job anyway. The lido was saved in the nick of time.In their determination to resurrect London Fields Lido, campaigners including Martin joined forces with architects and the Environment Trust, and presented plans for the pool to the community in 2003. Hackney council finally agreed to fund the renovation in 2004.The transformation that has taken place in the neighbourhood since was initially driven by campaigners seeking to regenerate the borough – not only at the lido, but also a few minutes away on Broadway Market, a street below London Fields that was once a drovers’ route into the city. It hosts a hugely successful Saturday market launched by local residents and traders in 2004, two years before the pool reopened. Time Out calls the street “a promenade for the East End fashion set”.Many people are boosters of the newly revitalised area. “What does it say about the last 30-odd years of government in this country that people from other parts of the country are travelling down to London to spend the weekend in a park?” asks Hackney councillor Jon Burke, who is responsible for energy, sustainability and community services, including lidos. “Where have we gone so badly wrong that Liverpool, Sheffield, Leeds, Newcastle, Hull, don’t offer this standard of living to everybody?”For some of the campaigners who kickstarted the regeneration, however, there is a rueful recognition of the role they may have played in changing the character of the neighbourhood. Liz Veitch, a retired teacher, says that when she first moved to London Fields 25 years ago, she could almost see the tumbleweed blowing down Broadway Market, a street that had once been home to a popular East End market. Hackney council made a number of failed attempts to revive it, but it was only when local residents took on the challenge that the market succeeded. Her late husband, journalist Andrew Veitch, played an instrumental role in the market’s success, setting up a community interest company that he ran for 10 years. The revival of the market was a catalyst that helped transform London Fields into a destination for hipsters, swiftly followed by the reopening of the lido.“In the beginning it was local people trying to make what was a beaten up area a bit more attractive,” says Veitch. “People who moved in here, like us, felt they ought to do more in the community. I would say that the people buying into this area do not seem to share the same sense of community. The youngsters buying or renting these flats are too busy trying to live, but also there is an air of entitlement amongst amongst some of the more affluent members of the next generation. Thatcher’s children if you like. They don’t get involved here. When we were growing up, it was a mantra that was part of our upbringing - if you’re in a community you join in and do what you can.”When Hackney Council began selling off properties in Broadway Market at the start of the millennium, resulting in the eviction of popular local independent businesses, there was a huge campaign to stop the demolition of Cafe Francesca, run by Tony Platia for 30 years. Gentrification became a very dirty word, as Hackney council was accused of betraying the neighbourhood and getting into bed with the property developers.“The lido does not reflect the demography of Hackney,” says Josephine Bacon, who runs the lido user group. “It’s very white, it’s very middle class, it’s quite young. Hackney and Better’s advertisements promote swimming for everyone, saying come and join in, and they have photographs of black people on their posters and banners. Of course there are some black people there, but hardly any. And probably not very many unemployed or low income swimmers either. And I’m not really sure why - whether because it’s too expensive or because London Fields has become a chi-chi area. I don’t know what can be done to make it more inclusive.”It’s a problem that goes beyond Hackney. Swim England’s research in 2015 revealed that ethnic minorities are half as likely to know how to swim as white members of the population. The closure of Hackney’s pools in the noughties may also have had an impact on the next generation of swimmers. It may, however, be true that the number of options is increasing: London Fields Lido is dwarfed by the London Aquatics Centre in Stratford, a legacy of the 2012 Olympics that is home to three pools. The once run-down neighbourhood of Hackney Wick, on the edge of what was the Olympic Park, is now touted as the next London Fields – but that has also meant the demolition of Vittoria Wharf, forcing out a community of poorer residents and artists.London Fields Lido “is not a country club for the affluent,” Burke insists. “It’s important that this facility is able to be accessed by people irrespective of their socioeconomic, ethnic, religious backgrounds.” He says he hopes that the new refurbishment of the changing rooms – which includes the introduction of internal cubicles and internal lockers – will broaden its appeal, as well as satisfying those who have previously been concerned about modesty or security.So far, it’s hard to tell. The newly-refurbished lido reopened in January many of the swimmers are young and white, more typical of newcomers to the neighbourhood than longtime residents. This may not be the classless vision of lido culture that its great political advocates imagined in the 30s when they built the pools in London and across the UK. It may not be the community that the campaigners imagined either, when they fought to revive the lido and what was then a run-down market street. But it’s now a fixture and a landmark – even if that’s as a symbol of ision as much as transformation.A version of this article appears in Tales of Two Londons, edited by Claire Armitstead Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/868df3251f60c7f0fe71cd49a179e83ddfeb27ff/112_592_2756_1654/master/2756.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7c5b3c438ae0dbe93ded39a57ac89b36 1240w","title":"landlords social parasites last people should be honouring buy to let","story":"The landlord of the year award is announced on Monday, bestowed by the home insurance provider Home Protect. “Landlords often get a bad rap,” the CEO explains on its website, and I’ll stop him there. They don’t get a bad enough rap.When they do make the news, you already know the story. Tory landlords dragging their absentee, ancient arses into parliament solely to vote down a bill that says rented properties should be “fit for human habitation”. “Lockdown” landlords bleeding councils dry, installing vulnerable people in micro-units, with inadequate fire provisions, so they can soak up treble the housing benefit. Who can forget the competition in the Daily Mail that offered up a buy-to-let property as top prize? This, from a paper that crucifies scroungers. Scroungers being people who live off others, and shirk their responsibilities. But back to landlords, eh?Landlord of the year. Lol! Rofbhawuild! (Rolling on the floor, banging my head against the wall until I lose my deposit.) Who is it going to be? One who lets you have a pet? Some of my friends are landlords, and I’m sorry to say it, but they are going straight to hell too. Imagine how satisfyingly overcrowded the underworld must be with landlords partitioning the seventh circle into seven more circles, charging each other extra for underfloor heating. The best thing you can say about them is that they are better than letting agents. But that’s like giving Stalin a humanitarian award for massacring fewer people than Genghis Khan. The fact is, they’re all rogue. Whether your landlord is a genial profiteer or an actual psychopath is the luck of the draw. Anyone can be one, if they have made enough money or inherited property, and those are two of the worst qualifications imaginable. Like anyone who thrives off the housing crisis, they are social parasites.I wonder what is meant by a “good” private landlord, worthy of recognition. Someone who charges below insane market rates, purely by choice? Who pays for top-quality repairs, when they could get a mate to do a botched job on the cheap? Who offers long-term secure tenancies, despite the fact there is no legal minimum? Who refrains from revenge evictions? Who isn’t Fergus Wilson? Someone who displays basic human decency, in an unregulated sector that encourages its opposite? Who acts, in other words, not like a landlord at all?If you are an oldster with a lodger, I’m sure you’re fine. But it’s the buy-to-let vampires, monopolising new builds, setting social inequality in stone, who define the term today. Try to understand these characters, so money-driven that they view people’s need to sleep indoors as the chance to turn a tidy profit. (Having said that, the main cause of homelessness in the UK is, by a long way, the termination of short-term tenancies, so maybe they’re not that committed to it.) No pets, no posters, no parties. That’s their mantra. No repairs. Don’t wear down the crap carpet. Just sit on a damp mattress and cough up the cash. All so they can keep expanding, squatting over lives like feudal incubi. If you’re one of these people, you can shove your property portfolio up your arse. And make sure you leave room for your award.The notion of houses as investment opportunities of any sort has been a cancer. Here’s a radical idea: buy a home if you can, then live in it, and do something else with your time. Something that isn’t about exploiting the less privileged. Apologies for taking a Daily Mail-sounding stance on this, but landlords: get a proper job.A University of Kansas professor studying friendship has concluded that it takes more than 50 hours of shared time to become anything more than an acquaintance, 90\u0026nbsphours\u0026nbspto develop a friendship, and more than 200 hours of time together to become close friends.

The types of experience matter, too – hours spent working together don’t count for as much, he has decided.

For the third time in 15 years, western countries, led by the United States, have taken military action against a majority Muslim, Middle Eastern country. Support for intervention is not limited to the hard right: that Syria should be bombed was the mainstream view of the American foreign policy establishment, along with Britain and France.Let us be clear that the use of chemical weapons is a horrific crime. But we do not know the full story of what happened in Douma to say this is not to engage in conspiracy theories, but merely to admit that it has still been only a few days since the reports emerged. Yet there seems to be little interest among pro-interventionists in asking even basic questions, or in allowing the UN to lead an investigation. We have been here before with the lies that led to the Iraq war, but that precedent does not seem to deter western leaders as they seek yet again to rush to claim the moral high ground.But if it is astounding that after failure in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya, the west has chosen military intervention again, what is just as disappointing is that the rest of the world continues to turn a blind eye. It is time for non-western countries to recognise that by not getting proactively involved in international diplomatic efforts on these big issues, they relegate themselves to second-tier players, and allow western leaders to define what “appropriate” and “responsible” actions are.There has been some progress. Long criticised for not living up to its global responsibilities as a major power, in recent years China has expanded its foreign presence and soft power, with the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Belt and Road Initiative and a greater presence in global peacekeeping forces. Or look at south-east Asia, a region that has seen decades of interstate peace while being at least as ethnically and religiously erse as the war-torn Middle East.But while governments as well as iniduals across Africa and Asia are frustrated and angered by self-serving western actions, most remain silent. And without alternative initiatives and engagement from non-western actors, the west ends up monopolising the discussion. It is time politicians and diplomats in other parts of the world seized the initiative and stopped accepting their second-class status in the affairs of the world.Western nations may resist the erosion of their influence. Remember how the west dismissed the brokering initiative of the African Union in Libya and instead resorted to military intervention? It is a firmly held, yet rarely spoken, view in western political and diplomatic circles, that the rest of the world is unqualified to play any role in such crises – even though when it comes to understanding the root causes of many geopolitical tensions, diplomats from countries that have been colonised or otherwise interfered with by foreign powers are surely better equipped than the former colonial powers to find solutions.A high-level UN delegation, not led by western diplomats but instead by others from Asia, Africa and the Middle East, working for the last few years with the Syrian government, might well have found some solutions, had President Assad been offered some form of guarantee that he would not meet the same fate as Saddam Hussein or Muammar Gaddafi.After this latest strike by the west, the rest of the world needs to say “enough is enough”. Large, non-western countries or blocks such as India, Japan, China, Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and others such as the African Union, need to not just speak out against strikes, as China already has, but also work together to propose – and perhaps even implement – a different, non-violent and diplomatic platform. Allowing the west to dictate terms is last century’s norm.• Chandran Nair is chief executive and founder of the Global Institute For Tomorrow, a Hong Kong based thinktank"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f1fe237e87cd6d35e321869c571294215f6054c/84_245_3408_2045/master/3408.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8bd9e20e4a5af27771ced1b8a6d549db 1240w","title":"theresa may children windrush ministers","story":"One of the most appalling elements of the Windrush generation immigration scandal is that the mess is so easily fixable. The government has long had the right and the facility to grant indefinite leave to remain to those whose presence in the country may be technically questionable but socially desirable. That it has chosen not to do so tells us much, as does today’s revelation that No 10 has snubbed a plea from Commonwealth heads of government for talks about the debacle.The government has not acted decisively so far because it has not felt compelled to do so. For many months now, the Guardian reporter Amelia Gentleman has trodden a lonely path in trying to highlight these stories, without exciting the sort of supplementary interest from other media that might persuade ministers and their advisers that failure to do so placed their own futures in jeopardy. But in recent days, other newspapers and broadcasters have begun to expose the government’s failure to act. The equation, and with it the level of risk to politicians and bureaucrats, has changed. That speaks to the power of the media even now to hold the system to account, a vital component of our democracy. But it also says some sorry things about Theresa May and those who do her bidding.This is a government that lacks purpose and obvious competence. We see that in its stewardship of the NHS, the benefits system, and most of all, its muddling towards an ill-considered, undefined, illogical Brexit. But what is just as disturbing, given the might of government and the extent to which its activities have a direct effect on people’s lives, is the lack of any moral grounding or emotional intelligence. It wields power disproportionately and clumsily. It tramples on the cares of ordinary people like a drunk in hobnail boots.It is said that up close, May herself is thoughtful and personable, but when it’s time to go to work, she is the leader who thought the best way to allay immigration concerns was to hire vans with advertising boards telling undesired immigrants to “go home”. She is the one who sent the signal to her officials that, henceforth, those whose immigration status was questionable should find Britain a “hostile environment”. She is the one who went to Grenfell and, initially at least, couldn’t spare the time to speak to victims. She runs a government that tells the infirm that they must work and disabled people that they aren’t really disabled.Leaders lead. Followers follow. If you look at May’s bloodless, technocratic approach to government, you easily understand how those who serve her feel able, or perhaps compelled, to do their jobs unburdened by any demand for compassion or empathy. She sets the tone. She must change it. She could start today by meeting the Caribbean leaders and responding to their concerns, as well as those voiced by 140 MPs from across the political spectrum.Of course, that will require political navigation. She knows that after the poisonous Brexit campaign – and thanks to her lieutenants, messrs Gove and Johnson – the public expectation is that by fair means or foul, she will be tough towards immigrants. But even her own logic dictates a different approach. Along with the “deep and special” relationship she envisages with the EU post-Brexit, her ministers promise a new and vital recoupling with the Commonwealth. How does this mistreatment of its people, this trashing of historic ties and this deaf ear to the concerns of its representatives, forward that strategy?It could be that, in their calculations, ministers believed that there would be no groundswell of support for middle-aged black people, irrespective of any ties they have or the contributions they have made to communities up and down the country. In that, again, the technocrats are being proved wrong by the media, MPs and the public. That may be the only heartening development so far in this sorry affair.• Hugh Muir is associate editor of Guardian Opinion"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21652220c12e4a62c5360786df0c1f2077c63afc/0_72_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9202cac8def0663fc46e54790cbc4809 1240w","title":"university pensions strikes union campaign","story":"They have not done so with any great faith in Universities UK’s commitment to sustaining existing levels of provision, nor with any conviction that the employers’ underlying determination to reduce their pension liabilities has suddenly disappeared.This was a decision driven more by short-term calculations about what further strike action in the summer term might deliver than about accepting Universities UK’s claim that it now recognises “the clear wish of staff to have a guaranteed pension comparable with current provision”.Let’s be clear: the employers have not shifted their position because they have been enlightened or become newly benevolent. Fourteen days of strike action, the ongoing work to rule and the threat of significant disruption to the exam period forced them to change their tune and belatedly to recognise that the campaign to defend a defined benefits pension scheme might have some justification.The dispute has changed the union: thousands have joined up, moribund branches have revived, and a process of radical political education has taken place. While ordinary members have become experts in superannuation schemes and actuarial arguments, we have all learned that the debate is about far more than pensions. Instead it concerns the broad direction of travel of the university sector under neoliberalism. Pension obligations, far from being a technical and opaque issue, are in fact one of the main constraints on the ability of entrepreneurial-minded institutions to operate as autonomous companies in a higher education (and shiny new buildings) market.Many branches have already started to ask some fundamental questions about governance and democracy – not just about the secrecy and lack of transparency of the USS valuation process, but about decision-making in their own institutions. FOI requests about how resources are allocated and campaigns for democratic representation on decision-making committees and structures are likely to become bread-and-butter elements of branch agendas.The dispute has further illustrated the precarious position of hourly paid staff who can barely afford pension contributions. At the same time, it has highlighted the bloated nature of a higher education system that gobbles up tuition fees in order to generate surpluses which it then spends on infrastructure and inflated salaries for vice-chancellors, while pleading poverty when it comes to adequately compensating staff.Acceptance of the offer does not signal the end of the pensions campaign. The composition and work of the proposed panel needs to be scrutinised. The issue of fair pensions must not be kicked into the long grass. The suspension of the action, however, will make it harder to maintain the energy and militancy that emerged so dramatically during the strikes. As the academic Jack Saunders has noted, a “pause” in a dispute is always dangerous: “With momentum gone, attention dissipates and people move on to new problems … Examples of workers successfully prosecuting disputes with a substantial pause in the middle are rare to non-existent.”Oversight of the expert panel is linked to the accountability of union negotiators to its members. And accountability has been in short supply in recent weeks. First, the University and College Union’s general secretary, Sally Hunt, proposed an Acas-aided deal with Universities UK – rejected vociferously by members – which was so unpopular that #NoCapitulation started to trend on Twitter. The union’s higher education committee then voted to put Universities UK’s fresh offer to members, even though this offer had not been negotiated with the union and dozens of branches had requested revisions and clarifications.Finally, the handling of the ballot itself raises questions about the conduct of the leadership, not least because the ballot was accompanied by a lengthy text from the general secretary urging a “yes” vote without any countervailing arguments.Yet democracy was everywhere on the ground during the strikes: in action committees, grassroots initiatives such as teach-outs and staff-student forums, lively branch meetings and indeed the grassroots rebellion against the deal reached at Acas. University staff will now have to rebuild these democratic spaces and galvanise themselves if they are to maintain pressure on both employers and their own negotiators to deliver a pension settlement that is meaningfully comparable to existing provision.Meanwhile, there is unfinished business. Ordinary union members and student supporters, radicalised by the dispute, are now set to play a key role in campaigns against university marketisation. They are best placed both to protect the memory of the dispute and to learn its lessons. They will need not only to scrutinise the work of the forthcoming joint experts panel in future revaluations of the pension scheme, but, more broadly, to coordinate the resistance against the corruption of public higher education by a market that knows the price of everything but the value of nothing.• Des Freedman is professor of media and communications at Goldsmiths, University of London, and is the author of The Politics of Media Policy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29200dcf527209559b1c861be12ef9ce4d9439c6/77_445_5139_3084/master/5139.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=33792879e25c87a79e279d1c12814f50 1240w","title":"the ingenious cyclewear victorian women invented to navigate social mores","story":"Patents by female inventors from the 1890s reveal the creative ways women made their body mobile through clothingMuch has been written about the bicycle’s role as a vehicle of women’s liberation. But far less is known about another critical technology women used to forge new mobile and public lives – cyclewear. I have been studying what Victorian women wore when they started cycling. Researching how early cyclists made their bodies mobile through clothing reveals much about the social and physical barriers they were navigating and brings to light fascinating tales of ingenious inventions.Cycling was incredibly popular for middle- and upper-class women and men in the late 19th century, and women had to deal with distinct social and sartorial challenges. Cycling exaggerated the irrationality of women’s conventional fashions more than any other physical activity. Heavy, layered petticoats and long skirts caught in spokes and around pedals. Newspapers regularly published gruesome accounts of women dying or becoming disfigured in cycling crashes due to their clothing.Fortunately, little was going to stop women riding and they rose to these challenges in a plethora of ways. Some took to wearing “rational” dress, such as replacing skirts with bloomers. While this was safer and more comfortable for cycling, dress reform was controversial. It was not unusual for onlookers who felt threatened by the sight of progressive “New Women” to hurl insults, sticks and stones. Other women adopted site-specific strategies to minimise harassment, such as cycling in conventional fashions in town and changing into more radical garments for “proper riding”.Some pioneering women came up with even more inventive strategies. Remarkably, some Victorians not only imagined, designed, made and wore radical new forms of cyclewear but also patented their inventions. The mid-1890s marked a boom in cycling and also in patenting, and not only for men. Cycling’s “dress problem” was so mobilising for women that cyclewear inventions became a primary vehicle for women’s entry into the world of patenting. The patents for convertible cyclewear are particularly striking. These garments aimed ambitiously for respectability and practicality. Inventors concealed converting technologies inside skirts, including pulley-systems, gathering cords, button and loop mechanisms and more, that enabled wearers to switch between modal identities when required.Alice Bygrave, a dressmaker from Brixton, lodged a UK patent in 1895 for “Improvements in Ladies’ Cycling Skirts”. She aimed to “provide a skirt proper for wear when either on or off the machine”. Her parents owned a watch- and clock-making shop in Chelsea and her brother and sister-in-law were professional cyclists. Her invention brings all of these influences together in an ingenious skirt with a dual pulley system sewn in the front and rear seams that adjusts height according to the needs of the wearer. Bygrave also patented her invention in Canada, Switzerland and America, and it was manufactured and distributed by Jaeger. It was a hit, and was sold throughout the UK and America. It even made its way to Australia.Julia Gill, a court dressmaker from north London, registered her convertible cycling skirt in 1895. Her aim was to “provide a suitable combination costume for lady cyclists, so that they have a safe riding garment combined with an ordinary walking costume”. This deceptively ordinary A-line skirt gathers up to the waist via a series of concealed rings and cord into what Gill called a “semi-skirt”. The lower flounce, when made from similar material to the jacket, creates a stylish double peplum. The inventor also recommended combining the skirt with some rather splendid “fluted or vertical frilled trowsers”.Mary and Sarah Pease, sisters from Yorkshire, submitted their patent for an “Improved Skirt, available also as a Cape for Lady Cyclists” in 1896. As the name suggests, this is two garments in one – a full cycling skirt and a cape. The wide waistband doubles as a fashionable high ruché collar. This garment is one of the more radical designs of the period because the skirt completely comes away from the body. Cyclists wanting to ride in bloomers could wear it as a cape or use the gathering ribbon to secure it to handlebars, safe in the knowledge they could swiftly replace the skirt should the need arise.Henrietta Müller, a women’s right’s activist from Maidenhead, registered her convertible cycling patent in 1896. Unusually, the inventor addressed an entire three-piece suit – a tailored jacket, an A-line skirt that can be raised in height via loops sewn into the hem that catch at buttons at the waistband, and an all-in-one undergarment combining a blouse and bloomer. Müller was committed to the idea of progress for women, and not content with trying to fix one element when she could see problems with the entire system. She was acutely aware of the politics and practicalities of pockets for newly independent mobile women. As a result, this cycling suit features five pockets, and Müller encouraged users to add more.These inventions are just some of the fascinating ways early female cyclists responded to challenges to their freedom of movement. Through new radical garments and their differently clad bodies they pushed against established forms of gendered citizenship and the stigma of urban harassment. Claiming their designs through patenting was not only a practical way of sharing and distributing ideas it was also a political act.These stories add much-needed layers and textures to cycling histories because they depict women as critically engaged creative citizens actively driving social and technical change. Importantly, they remind us that not all inventions are told through loud or heroic narratives. These inventors put in an awful lot of work to not be seen. They were successful in many ways, yet the nature of their deliberately concealed designs combined with gender norms of the time means they have been hidden in history – we have yet to find any examples in museums. As such, they raise questions: what else don’t we know about? How can we look for other inventions hidden in plain sight? And if we learn more about a wider range of contributors to cycling’s past, might it change how we think about and inhabit the present?• Dr Kat Jungnickel is a senior lecturer in sociology at Goldsmiths, University of London.

The problem was that dropping Raheem Sterling for Ilkay Gündogan was such a rare move – removing a forward for an extra midfielder – that it disrupted Manchester City’s rhythm. He has admitted it may have caused his players to wonder if their ultra-positive coach was “wary” of Liverpool and affected how they performed. By 57 minutes the tactic had failed and on came Sterling for Gündogan. Yet if Guardiola did more of this kind of adjustment the team would view it as less an experiment and more the norm and the Catalan would surely become as slick with Plan B as with his Plan A.Despite Agüero’s 30 goals in 39 appearances – 21 of which were scored in the Premier League – Guardiola remains lukewarm regarding the Argentinian. The manager believes City are better with Gabriel Jesus as the spearhead because of the Brazilian’s swifter link play that allows the side to play more fluidly. Although Guardiola is open to Agüero leaving this summer, it would be detrimental to let him go. Could Jesus step up and contribute the weight of goals required should Agüero depart? His figures suggest so but he is yet to enjoy a sustained injury-free period since joining in January 2017. This term Jesus has nine league strikes in 14 starts (13 in all competitions), and last year there were seven in eight. This is an impressive ratio that will have to be continued.Guardiola has Fernandinho, Gündogan, David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne as frontline midfielders. There is also Fabian Delph – who is not trusted in the position – plus Oleksandr Zinchenko, who is preferred at left-back. Yet the manager will bolster this area of the squad in the close season, for two reasons. First, Silva is 32 and Fernandinho turns 33 next month so each will have their game time managed next season. Second, Guardiola’s is a fierce football ethos based on midfielders being the prime personnel on which his teams are founded. In saying once that Fernandinho can play all 10 outfield positions Guardiola made the manifesto clear. Borussia Dortmund’s Julian Weigl, 22, is among those the manager will consider in the transfer window.The perennial question of who will replace Vincent Kompany remains despite the captain’s late-season run of fitness which has taken his league appearances to 15 (19 in all competitions). Guardiola hopes Aymeric Laporte’s January recruitment can help provide an answer, as the Frenchman competes with Kompany, Nicolás Otamendi and John Stones for a place. Yet Kompany’s injury proneness means Guardiola has only three central defenders he can rely on for a position in which his system often requires this number. Expect Kyle Walker and Benjamin Mendy to be shifted across from full-back on occasion but West Bromwich Albion’s Jonny Evans, a career centre-back, may again be of interest.This may be counterintuitive after City were dumped from the Champions League quarter-finals, 5-1 by Liverpool, but Guardiola must not lose courage in his quest for ever more perfect football. Given how invigorating City are to watch, next season’s fascination will be whether the Pep way can conquer Europe, while he tries to retain the Premier League crown. To do so he has to solve the issue that plagued him at Bayern Munich, between 2013-16, and in two continental campaigns at City: how to fill the gap in the XI where he fielded Lionel Messi for his double European Cup-winners, Barcelona. The Argentinian was Guardiola’s genie in a bottle, his go-to when the club needed to pull away from an opponent who came at Barça, just as Jürgen Klopp’s men did at City this month. Guardiola has to find another way, and if he maintains the brave desire to always dazzle, the result could be a Messi-less City who are even better than his gilded Barça."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c835b8d0891a3d5a34ba44ba9cfe58a71d22f8f/0_73_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=36ae84c88c476c7204184836ed99f5c5 1240w","title":"psg ligue 1 title project monaco","story":"PSG smashed their closest challengers 7-1 to win the Ligue 1 title but they need some new ideas to progress in EuropeBy Adam White and Eric Devin for Get French Football NewsFew clubs could canter to a treble and end the season disappointed, but Paris Saint-Germain have made a habit of it recently. They won the Coupe de la Ligue earlier this month, wrapped up the Ligue 1 title on Sunday night with a ludicrous 7-1 trampling of Monaco and are likely to pick up the Coupe de France in a few weeks’ time. You might think that such an effortless domestic campaign would be stabilising for the club, especially after they were ambushed by Monaco last season, but the PSG “project” is under more pressure to develop than ever.PSG have won the last seven domestic cups in France and only missed out on the league last season due to Monaco’s irresistible form. Monaco’s threat has been removed this season, largely by themselves. Leonardo Jardim had hopes of defending the title but that proved impossible after his team lost so many significant players. Jardim accepts that the club moves in cycles – winning the title was the culmination of one such cycle, which allowed them to sell their main assets and start again €300m better off. With Monaco in transition this season, PSG were free to gallop clear.Of course, PSG took the opposite approach last summer and splurged €400m on Neymar and Kylian Mbappé – employing their usual “solution”. Despite all their managerial changes and new players – Zlatan Ibrahimovic in 2012, Edinson Cavani in 2013, David Luiz in 2014, Ángel Di María in 2015, Julian Draxler in 2016 and so on – their results in Europe have remained disappointingly consistent. The limp Champions League exit at Manchester City that hastened Laurent Blanc’s departure in 2016 was no worse than the debacle in Barcelona under Unai Emery the following year. And the less said about their inept second-leg display against Real Madrid this season, which will cost the Spaniard his job, the better.Their defeats in Europe over the last three seasons have not led to wholesale changes at the club. More big-money stars are expected to arrive this summer, with Paul Pogba a target, FFP-willing the manager will be replaced again and the new boss will also take over without having unanimous support from all factions of the club.The club’s owner, Emir Al Thani, seems to have chose Thomas Tuchel rather than Porto’s Sérgio Conceição (sporting director Antero Henrique’s first choice) or Carlo Ancelotti (the option favoured by some of the key players). At first glance, Tuchel seems to be a smart appointment. He has a reputation for being an innovative and versatile coach who can build a successful side if given time and the right conditions. PSG could finally develop some identity. But again, Tuchel looks set to be forced into the same box as Blanc and Emery, underlined by a reported two-year offer, which reeks of the same short-term thinking.For Tuchel to succeed in Europe, PSG’s hierarchy have to throw out the methods that have repeatedly hindered their progress. They need a more holistic, longer-term approach to squad development. Last summer they should have signed a goalkeeper, a defensive midfielder and a left-back but they prioritised bringing in two forwards for the sake of brand recognition. The influence of a cliquey squad needs to be broken. Divisions in the camp are so ingrained that Le Parisien designed a Venn Diagram outlining each social group the Brazilian contingent supposedly has so much power that Emery was dissuaded from removing Thiago Silva as captain after the loss to Barcelona last season. Some players are afforded too much latitude, none more so than Neymar, who threw an extravagant, drunken birthday for the entire squad nine days before the Real Madrid tie, was allowed to go back to Brazil and miss domestic cup matches, and clashed with Emery in training.The club’s focus on huge signings and established names continues to squeeze out developing, homegrown talent. Emery often looks like a passenger but, to his credit, he has made strides in giving more opportunities to established youngsters Giovani Lo Celso, Presnel Kimpembe and Adrien Rabiot have been occasional bright spots this season, although none of them have shone consistently throughout the campaign. PSG generally ignore the depth of their own academy – in contrast to Monaco, Lyon and their European “peers”, who often have a core of youth graduates interwoven with established players.Despite their inevitable treble and some effervescent displays in the league, PSG have stagnated this season. The club lacks direction, heart and a clear philosophy for developing players. They will not make any progress until they stop indulging in short-termism and pandering to their stars. • Lyon’s 3-0 victory at home to Amiens was their fifth straight win in the league, an impressive run considering the absence of Nabil Fékir. He returned from injury on Saturday and looked slightly rusty. His return to fitness is a welcome one – especially if he can replicate the form he showed earlier in the season – but Bruno Génésio now must figure out how to combine his captain with in-form Memphis Depay. The Dutchman was at it again on Saturday, scoring and setting up a goal, but there are worries now about how the pair will play together given that both seem to only be at their best as the sole focal point of the attack. Third place is still Lyon’s to lose, but Marseille also have a fairly easy run-in, so they need to get their tactics right.• Marseille’s dramatic win at Troyes on Sunday afternoon took them level on points with Lyon. Things looked to be going seriously awry for Marseille after Samuel Grandsir opened the scoring in the first minute with a bullet header. The match was an open affair throughout, with both teams badly needing a win, but Marseille picked up all three points thanks to Florian Thauvin’s superb late winner. Things are looking up for Marseille. Adil Rami is also back from injury they have a favourable draw against RB Salzburg in the Europa League semi-finals and have five games left in the league where they can secure a place in next season’s Champions League.• Relegation also remains a tight affair. Troyes’ defeat to Marseille and Lille’s draw against Guingamp have given Metz a shred of hope. Nolan Roux was the hero for Metz this weekend – his brace in their 2-1 win at Rennes means he now has 14 goals this season – but the team as a whole played with a relentlessness they had been missing of late. They are still bottom of the table, five points from the play-off position, but their remaining fixtures are more than kind so a great escape may yet be possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87bccb711951cdd65b4a84b3fe397c7253c9dd22/27_576_3536_2121/master/3536.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=cd6df0cf796c0bf8d13b2729b09f38be 1240w","title":"domenico tedesco joy european football schalke borussia dortmund","story":"The 32-year-old coach has transformed Schalke with a defender three years his senior and victory over Dortmund in the Revierderby left them on the verge of the Champions LeagueIt began with a 31-year-old rookie boss, with just months of head coaching experience, no European football to look forward to, and a public needing to be won over. On Sunday afternoon, it reached an apparent denouement, gloriously, with sweet victory over their fierce local rivals Borussia Dortmund, with Champions League football within touching distance and with that coach, Domenico Tedesco, wildly celebrating with the fans as Schalke enjoyed their best day in recent memory.Fittingly, as the jubilant players approached the hardcore on the Nordkurve, Tedesco – now a seasoned 32 – took centre stage clasped to his defensive rock, the Brazilian Naldo, three years his coach’s senior. This moment highlighted much of the respect that Tedesco has garnered from players who were weary, possibly sceptical and whose expectations had been lowered after a poor season under his predecessor, Markus Weinzierl, which had left Die Königsblauen as close to the relegation play-off as they were to Europe. Speaking to The Independent’s Archie Rhind-Tutt last month, Naldo called Tedesco “the best coach I ever had” in a decade and a half of senior football, which is some claim. Tedesco’s preparation and eye for detail has got the best out of a good but not outstanding squad, with the veteran Brazilian a good example of that. The towering centre-back has played every minute of Schalke’s Bundesliga campaign in a defence that has conceded fewer goals than any team but Bayern Munich.With two younger, nippier defenders either side of him in Tedesco’s three-man backline – in Sunday’s case, Benjamin Stambouli and 21-year-old Thilo Kehrer - Naldo’s slowing pace hasn’t been much of an issue. His power has come to the fore, and he has also chipped in with seven goals – he followed up his memorable headed leveller as Schalke came from 4-0 down to draw at Dortmund in November with a trademark rocket of a shot from a free-kick to seal Sunday’s win. The highlight reel will give the fans a great deal of pleasure post-season, but it’s everything in between that makes Tedesco’s work so impressive. To say Schalke’s supporters have overbearing expectations from past, pre-Bundesliga glories would be unfair, but this is a demanding club with significant pressures. They expect brave, attacking football. Tedesco’s style has been courageous in another way – bucking tradition, prizing defensive organisation and containment.The coach knew he was taking a risk, with the unloved Roberto Di Matteo’s defensive tactics not tolerated when results began to turn. While Tedesco’s side may be more graft than craft, however, they have shown that defending well and being ambitious are not mutually exclusive. They are totally committed, and that has come across well to the faithful. The opening day win over RB Leipzig set the tone for gritty, possession-light football punctuated by swift counters, normally emanating from wide. That was again the template here, with Daniel Caligiuri prominent at wing-back, creating the opener for Yevhen Konoplyanka and teeing up Naldo’s piledriver amid a lung-busting performance that stretched Dortmund’s defence at one end and helped keep their mastery of the ball strictly sterile at the other. Caligiuri, who was drifting at Wolfsburg, and Konoplyanka are two more players out of whom Tedesco has coaxed much more their previous coaches. Before the match, Dortmund’s sporting director, Michael Zorc, trailed the possibility that Stöger might still stay, highlighting a run of just one defeat in 12 Bundesliga games that set Dortmund back on course for Champions League qualification. Gratitude can only stretch so far, though. It’s hard to see how any Dortmund coach losing successive away games 6-0 at Bayern and then the Revierderby could be considered a long-term bet. As Stöger stood passive, stony-faced, almost motionless as his side eventually rolled over, the difference in demeanour between the Austrian and the livewire Tedesco – jumping, clapping and wildly gesticulating across his technical area – did not go unnoticed.“One coach lived the derby,” wrote Der Westen’s Peter Müller. “He was sweating his polo shirt all the way through. The other coach was able to put his yellow jacket back in the cupboard after the game with all the creases in the right places.” Tedesco was only getting sweatier at full time, beckoned into the Nordkurve to lead chants by the fans in the ultimate honour.“It’s a privilege to stand in the Nordkurve,” Tedesco said, not for a minute forgetting the power of the collective. “The whole team deserves to celebrate with them.” Having done his work – Schalke are now four points ahead of Dortmund and need an absolute maximum of five more points in four games to mathematically seal a Champions League spot – he now needs sporting director, Christian Heidel, to do his. They will lose Leon Goretzka – who has already signed for Bayern – and the similarly out-of-contract Max Meyer at the end of the season, and the squad needs to be beefed up in terms of numbers and quality with a return to Europe to negotiate. Yet with Tedesco at the helm, negotiating slightly choppier waters ahead doesn’t seem so much of a daunting prospect.• Bayern celebrated their sixth successive title in relaxed fashion, with many of the players bringing their children on to the pitch before the home game with Borussia Mönchengladbach. Yet once they eventually got underway – with Thiago Alcântara junior not too happy at having to leave the field – it was back to business. Josip Drmic’s early goal only served to provoke Jupp Heynckes’ side, missing a clutch of rested key players but pitiless, demolishing the nearest they have to a bogey side 5-1. The standards for Heynckes’ successor, Niko Kovac, are already clear.• Kovac’s current club, Eintracht Frankfurt, aren’t over the moon about the way the succession went down, with sporting director, Fredi Bobic, chiding Bayern as “unprofessional”. Seemingly half the sports photographers in Germany were waiting for Kovac as he took the bench for Saturday’s match at Bayer Leverkusen, in which his team gave a strong first-half performance before being blown away by Kevin Volland’s late hat-trick. Kovac still has plenty on his plate before moving back south, with a top six finish up for grabs – plus, potentially, two meetings with his future employers should Bayern and Eintracht both win their DfB Pokal semi-finals this week. • Hamburg’s and Köln’s threatened revivals were truncated by losses at Hoffenheim and Hertha respectively – and both will be eight points from safety if Mainz beat Freiburg in Monday night’s game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e99be583ef877126d4ee9ba9440e9a0485a65bdc/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2b650163336701d54b97969d5a984b3b 1240w","title":"premier league 10 talking points from weekend action","story":"José Mourinho needs to make drastic changes, Rafael Benítez is getting best out of his players and Jordan Ayew is on a missionHaving so meekly allowed Manchester City to claim the Premier League title, a process of rebuilding Manchester United into future champions starts now. The non-inclusion of Marouane Fellaini, Daley Blind, Matteo Darmian and Luke Shaw in José Mourinho’s match‑day 18 for this game at Old Trafford indicated where a long-awaited clear-out of David Moyes and Louis van Gaal recruits is likely to begin. But it will take more than that to revitalise United. The shapeless sludge of this performance against West Brom was no anomaly. Chief among the reasons United have been left in City’s wake is Mourinho’s inability to get the best from his purported stars.

The question now is whether Manchester City can follow up their achievements next season by winning the prize that the club covets more than any other. Despite Guardiola’s insistence that winning the Premier League was more of an achievement, the failure to add to the two Champions League titles he won at Barcelona is what he will ultimately be judged on. Recruiting another central midfielder to ease the burden on Fernandinho will be a major priority this summer, as will providing extra ammunition to the forward line given Sergio Agüero’s troubles with injury.

Defeat at Burnley, who scored their goals in the sixth and ninth minutes, left Claude Puel’s side nine points off seventh place, thus highly unlikely to be playing in the Europa League next season. The club’s owners continue to count the cost of a misplaced faith in Craig Shakespeare’s credentials to be a permanent manager rather than caretaker or assistant. Puel’s appointment in October after just two victories in nine games proved a far more adept decision but Leicester’s record of having now lost more games (12) than their 11 wins indicates a squad still failing to live up to its potential. And this is likely to be the last season Riyad Mahrez is around at the King Power Stadium.

Yet another in Crystal Palace ranks excelled in the M23 derby on Saturday to suggest he could yet have a role to play in Russia. This was Ruben Loftus-Cheek’s best performance at senior club level, the Chelsea loanee driving the hosts forward in a dominant opening period. After more than three months out with ankle trouble, the 22-year-old has swiftly recaptured form. “He has qualities,” said Roy Hodgson. “He was very good at screening, keeping the ball. He’s very good at beating players. His workrate has been very good. If he can play regularly for the last part of the season, then we will see him doing more and more as a player.” A place in the World Cup squad is far from outlandish.

They will probably avoid relegation from the top flight – beating Everton at home next weekend would practically confirm that – and if they do they will have debunked the notion a team can only survive if they have a core of wily Premier League veterans. Only three of the 24 players used by David Wagner this season had Premier League experience and two of those barely featured this season (Dean Whitehead has played 65 minutes, while Martin Cranie made three appearances before being sold in January). Huddersfield’s players do have experience of keeping cool in high-stakes duels, thanks to their play-off triumph last year, and the benefit of playing for one of England’s best‑run clubs.

Despite an exhausting midweek win against Manchester City in the Champions League there was no let-up from Jürgen Klopp’s team as they took their goals tally under the German to 300 in 148 games. Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané have scored 82 goals this season – the highest total from Liverpool’s three leading scorers in a single campaign. The manager wants more. Klopp said: “Three hundred is really a massive number. I love watching that kind of football but I don’t want to be the entertainer and it is like: ‘Oh we had fun but we didn’t win anything.’ I know the reason we come here together is to win things but I think the way you try to do it is important.” Andy Hunter• Match report: Liverpool 3-0 Bournemouth• Salah says European triumph is more important than goals recordThe best coaches improve players and, by that criterion, Rafaek Benítez must be regarded as exceptional. An alarmingly limited and inexperienced Newcastle squad are up to 10th, on 41 points, having just secured a fourth straight win, at Arsenal’s expense. Since New Year’s Day they have collected 22 points from a possible 36. Much of that is down to the extraordinary progress made by, among others, Jonjo Shelvey, Jamaal Lascelles, Mo Diamé, Ayoze Pérez and Paul Dummett since August. “Staying up is a fantastic achievement in what has been a very difficult season,” said Benítez, whose January loan recruitment of the Sparta Prague goalkeeper Martin Dubravka and Chelsea left winger Kenedy have proved shrewd. “Every week the whole team is progressing and improving. I’m really pleased.” Louise Taylor• Match report: Newcastle United 2-1 Arsenal• Jonathan Wilson: Arsenal fail to learn their lesson• Wenger says Arsenal defeat at Newcastle was ‘a worry character wise’There were a number of variables at work at St Mary’s. First was the bullish strength of Olivier Giroud, whose determination to make the most of every moment led to a change in attitude throughout the team. Then there was the mental frailty of Southampton, perhaps to be expected of a club in deep relegation trouble. And finally there was a tactical tweak and the rare sighting of a Blues back four. Conte’s preference for a three-man defence is renowned, the security it provides being the bedrock on which the rest of Chelsea’s play is built. It also puts a lot of stress on the wing‑backs to deliver from forward positions. Last season they rose to the challenge, this time not so much. Marcos Alonso remains a potent threat but not in this match, and when he stepped back to allow Willian and Pedro to roam the wide spaces Chelsea posed a very different set of questions. Paul MacInnes• Match report: Southampton 2-3 Chelsea• Hughes tells Southampton players to ‘get details right’ to survive• Kirby sends Chelsea into Women’s FA Cup final against ArsenalEvery club in the relegation battle needs a talisman to provide hope and inspiration, and Swansea have found theirs in Jordan Ayew. The 26-year-old has been a player transformed since Carlos Carvalhal took over as manager, scoring six times but bringing far more than just goals to a team who were so prosaic and toothless in the first half of the season. Ayew’s ability to hold the ball up, together with his skill and trickery, gives Swansea an attacking dimension badly missed during his three-match ban. He returned against Everton, playing alongside his brother André, and was a constant threat, linking play, creating chances and scoring an equaliser – his 11th goal of the season – with a wonderfully taken half‑volley. “We know that we will always fight and die for this club, because it has given me and my brother so much,” Jordan said afterwards. Stuart JamesTottenham’s excellent run of 14 games without defeat came to an end against a resurgent Manchester City clearly with a point to prove but Mauricio Pochettino will be concerned that his side can pick themselves up quickly for Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United. For all his success in making Spurs into genuine contenders, Pochettino has yet to win a trophy as a manager while it is now a decade since Tottenham supporters were last able to celebrate some silverware, the 2008 League Cup. Even if he has previously insisted that the domestic cup competition would not make up for failure elsewhere, with a top four place almost in the bag before Tuesday’s trip to face Brighton in the league, there is no reason why their manager cannot approach their semi-final full of ambition.

Broad beans are a labour of love in my kitchen – I love the neat green beans, but not the bitterness of their opaque cases – so it’s a double podding affair.

Here are the main points.I am conscious that there are issues around the cost of applying for no time limit applications and I think it is important that we work together going forward to find ways to make this easier ...When pushed on whether this meant she was going to waive the fee, as the BBC is reporting (see 1.39pm), she replied:I think it is important that we look at a range of measures that remove the deterrence from people for making contact with us.She also said the government was determined to sort this problem out.What I would say is I want to send a message to the West Indian community. We invited you here. We wanted you to come to the UK and help us rebuild after the second world war. We absolutely have a duty to make sure that those who have not had their status regularised - and there may well be many of them - have the opportunity now. Come and get in contact with the Home Office.I think I have been very clear how sorry I am about this whole situation. These are people who we have welcomed to our country, who we relied upon after the second world war to help rebuild. So of course I’m sorry. I’m sorry for all of the inidual, heart-breaking cases. And we have to do better.She also said she accepted there had been mistakes.I’m very conscious that we have made some mistakes, which we cannot continue to make and I’m determined that we won’t. Because these people have contributed an enormous amount. And just because they don’t have a passport, or can’t prove how long they’ve been here, we should be treating them with sensitivity and sympathy, and not detaining them.In other interviews (see 12.30pm and 12.57pm) she said that some “Windrush generation” migrants had been deported because they did not have the right paperwork.We just want people to give us what records they have, work with us, so we can work with the DVLA, with DWP, HMRC, to build up a picture of their time here, so that we aren’t asking for this onerous burden of proof.This is from the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg.There will be an urgent question on the “Windrush generation” at 3.30pm.And then, after Theresa May’s Syria statement, Andrea Leadsom, the Commons leader, will make a business statement. Perhaps the government is scheduling a proper Syria debate after all for tomorrow (in which case there would be no need for an emergency debate tonight)?This is from my colleague Patrick Wintour, the Guardian’s diplomatic editor, on the “Windrush generation” U-turn.Nick Timothy, who was Theresa May’s special adviser when she was at the Home Office and in Number 10 until he left after the 2017 election, has joined those Tories saying “Windrush generation” immigrants are being treated dreadfully by the government.In the Twitter thread I quoted earlier (see 12.26pm), the immigration barrister Colin Yeo says policies implemented while May was home secretary (and Timothy was working for her) have exacerbated the problem.ITV News have now released a clip of Caroline Nokes, the immigration minister, conceding the some “Windrush generation” immigrants have been deported. This is from ITV’s Paul Brand.Asked if some people have been deported as a result of not having the right papers, Nokes said:There have been some horrendous situations which as a minister have appalled me. When it was put to her that she was saying yes, and when she was asked how many people had been deported, Nokes replied:No, I don’t know the numbers. But what I’m determined to do going forward is say we will have no more of this. We want people to have confidence to come to the Home Office. We want to give them a message of reassurance, because I value these people.According to Channel 4 News’s Cathy Newman, the immigration minister Caroline Nokes told her in an interview being broadcast tonight that some “Windrush generation” immigrants have been deported in error.Colin Yeo, a barrister who specialises in asylum and immigration cases, has posted a very good thread explaining how the problems facing the “Windrush generation” immigrations have been exacerbated by relatively recent policy decisions taken by the government. It starts here.Tony Blair opened the speech that would launch Britain into war with Iraq with these momentous words: “It is right that this house debate this issue and pass judgment. That is the democracy that is our right but that others struggle for in vain.”Ever since that fateful day in 2003, MPs have jealously guarded the right to authorise military action. In 2006, it was endorsed by a House of Lords constitutional inquiry and enthusiastically advocated by the future foreign secretary William Hague in 2007.Limiting the royal prerogative, on which matters of war and peace have always relied, was taken as one of the tokens of a modernising Conservative party. In 2011, the coalition government pledged that it would observe the convention, except in circumstances of an emergency.Yet a vote in parliament was still a negotiable affair. There was no debate before the significant escalation of British involvement in Afghanistan in 2006, and approval for involvement in Libya in 2011 was only asked for, and given, after it had begun.Legal experts pronounced the so-called convention to be more of a trend than a substantive change.In 2013, however, David Cameron sought approval for a punitive strike on Syria in circumstances very similar to Friday night’s, and on broadly the same legal basis. His defeat – or at least, the fact that he accepted it – appeared to mark a turning point. It was considered to have greatly strengthened the power of parliament.The following year, again observing the convention, Cameron asked for approval for intervention against Isis in Iraq. This time parliament approved the motion.It appeared that the convention that parliament has a say in the deployment of military force was meeting the first requirement of any convention - that it is respected by those who technically have the power to ignore it. The outstanding debate appeared to be only on when it was permissible to ignore it.That makes this morning’s attack by Penny Mordaunt, the international development secretary, so significant. (See 8.52am.) It is highly likely her position - that the intelligence on which a decision such as Friday night’s was based cannot be shared with MPs - will be echoed by the prime minister this afternoon.Opposition MPs, who have been demanding the recall of parliament ever since the chemical strike happened more than a week ago, will be furious. There are two significant reasons why May could have misjudged her strength.The first will be that MPs – possibly including some on the government side – will fight a straightforward defence of a hard-won power against its erosion by a government that has already shown scant regard for parliament in Brexit negotiations.The second is political rather than constitutional. The SNP leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, has repeatedly argued that a minority government like May’s has a particular obligation to consult parliament and carry it in order to have legitimacy for its major decisions. That is also a case that will be made today.Theresa May will meet Caribbean leaders this week to discuss the plight of the “Windrush generation”, the prime minister’s spokesman told journalists at this morning’s lobby briefing.That amounts to a very swift U-turn - No 10 had refused a request for a formal meeting - although the spokesman said that May herself did not know that Caribbean leaders had asked for a meeting on this until this morning.A meeting of EU foreign ministers, attended by the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has agreed on a strong statement in support of the airstrikes. They say: The Syrian conflict has entered its eighth year of continuous and widespread violence, persistent and brutal violations of international law, including abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law, by all parties as well as the repeated use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime and by Da’esh.The Syrian regime bears the overwhelming responsibility for the catastrophic humanitarian situation and the suffering of the Syrian people. We strongly condemn the continued and repeated use of chemical weapons by the regime in Syria, including the latest attack on Douma, which is a grave breach of international law and an affront to human decency.In this context, the council understands that the targeted US, French and UK airstrikes on chemical weapons facilities in Syria were specific measures having been taken with the sole objective to prevent further use of chemical weapons and chemical substances as weapons by the Syrian regime to kill its own people. The council is supportive of all efforts aimed at the prevention of the use of chemical weapons. This is the position expressed on behalf of the EU at the OPCW.Sajid Javid, the housing and communities secretary whose parents came to the UK as immigrants, has said that he is “deeply concerned” about the problems some “Windrush generation” immigrants are facing and that the government is looking into the problems “urgently”.The Guardian has been writing about this issue for a while, but one suspects that what is causing alarm in government is that papers like the Sun (here) and the Daily Mail (here) have now taken up this story with gusto. In an editorial the Sun even says the treatment of the Windrush immigrants has been “appalling”.This is from Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, explaining why he has released the legal opinion saying the Syria air strikes were unlawful. (See 11.03am.) Watson said:I commissioned this advice from Professor Akande, one of the country’s pre-eminent legal experts on international law, because I wanted to be certain of the legal position on the strikes. MPs and the public should not have to rely on the partial information about legality released by the government. There is a clear public interest in this expert and impartial advice from Professor Akande and that is why I am releasing it in full. The government should do the same with their advice.The government has published a summary of its legal advice saying the air strikes were lawful, but not the full opinion.This is from my colleague Polly Toynbee on Penny Mordaunt’s comments about their being no need for parliament to be consulted about the Syrian air strikes. (See 8.52am.)There have been at least three applications under standing order 24 (see 10.34am) for emergency debates on Syria, I’m told - one from the government and at least two from the opposition. It is not clear yet which will get called.(If this was a Labour conference, there would be a committee to agree a composite motion - combining wording from all three - but I’m afraid parliament doesn’t work like that.)Ian Blackford, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, told Sky News earlier that he had received a briefing from the government on the Syrian air attacks and that, on the basis of what he had been told, he was satisfied that the Assad regime was to blame for the chemical attack at Douma. He said:I would say that, having had a briefing which I’ve just come from, I am satisfied that this has been the regime in Syria that has been responsible for this, and of course they have to be called out in the absolute strongest terms.But he restated the SNP’s view that Theresa May was wrong to authorise air strikes without consulting parliament and before the OPCW investigation had concluded.The UK delegation to the OPCW has also been tweeting about today’s meeting. (See 11.12am.)Russia has denied claims made by the US administration, at a meeting of a global watchdog, that it may have tampered with the site of the recent alleged chemical weapons attack in Syria.A US envoy told a closed-door session of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), in The Hague, on Monday that they had reason to fear interference, following the attack on the 7 April in the town of Douma, outside the Syrian capital.“It is our understanding the Russians may have visited the attack site”, Reuters reported the the US ambassador Kenneth Ward telling his fellow envoys. He said:It is our concern that they may have tampered with it with the intent of thwarting the efforts of the OPCW Fact-Finding Mission to conduct an effective investigation.The Russian embassy in The Hague denied that the Kremlin had any intention into interfere in the OPCW investigation. The embassy instead claimed that the military strikes by the US, the UK and France had been an attempt to undermine efforts to get to the facts.“Russia confirms its commitment to ensure safe (sic) and security of the mission and will not interfere in its work,” the Russian embassy tweeted.The OPCW has 192 members, and Monday’s governing executive council meeting of 41 states was called by its chairman, the Bangladeshi ambassador, Sheikh Mohammed Belal, “to discuss the alleged use of chemical weapons” in Syria.The UK’s ambassador, Peter Wilson, said the OPCW had recorded more than 390 alleged incidents of illicit use of poisonous munitions in Syria since 2014. He said: The time has come for all members of this executive council to take a stand. Too many duck the responsibility that comes with being a member of this council. Failure to act to hold perpetrators to account will only risk further barbaric use of chemical weapons, in Syria and beyond.The European Union told the meeting that Russia and Iran should use their influence on the Syrian government to prevent it from further use of chemical weapons.“The EU calls upon all countries, notably Russia and Iran, to use their influence to prevent any further use of chemical weapons, notably by the Syrian regime”, the bloc said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/165594c0a018e5bc8fd44af1d6f1e0afe783a7f1/0_259_4368_2621/master/4368.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=753d6942c7d2626af14b48ca118c2500 1240w","title":"value of london flats slashed by grenfell style cladding","story":"Home in New Capital Quay, Greenwich, worth £50,000 rather than £475,000, owner toldA homeowner in a housing complex in London with Grenfell-type cladding has been told the value of her £475,000 home has collapsed and is now just £50,000.Galliard Homes, the developer of the 11-block complex in New Capital Quay in south-east London, is facing a £30m-£40m bill to replace the cladding and is locked in a legal dispute over who should pay.The dispute, which could take years to resolve, has left Cecile Langevin, 32, and potentially thousands of others up and down the country, with an unsellable flat.“It is like someone has taken away our life choices, our freedom,” she said. “And nobody is doing anything about it,” she added, in tears.Langevin has a two-year-old son and was due to give birth to her second child on Saturday. She had put their flat on the market in the hope of moving out of London to a bigger home.She got a Rics-approved surveyor to value her flat recently and was shocked when he came back with a £50,000 price tag. But now she realises the whole complex is blighted.“All ongoing sales in the development have fallen through. Banks are not lending to potential buyers and provide valuations of zero for flats in our development,” she said.Langevin is one of about 2,000 residents in NCQ in Greenwich, believed to be the largest private development found to have flammable cladding after the west London disaster that cost 71 lives.“I don’t sleep at night. I wake up most nights for a few hours and I write emails to people I think that can help,” said Langevin.“I can’t move very fast. What would happen if my husband was away one night? We are on the seventh floor. What if if I was there with my son and new baby and all the people were at the stairs and I couldn’t get out?” she asked.While cladding remains on such buildings, the fire brigade requires 247 fire patrol in case evacuation is needed, but in three cases so far in private blocks, including one in Croydon and another in Salford, this has meant leaseholders will face bills potentially of tens of thousands of pounds.“It is quite shocking that the residents are living in potential death traps while everybody else tries to deny liability for the cost of making them safe. There is the potential for the residents to bring group legal proceedings to recover the cost of fixing the buildings and for the considerable distress they must be suffering,” said Chris Haan, a lawyer at the London law firm Leigh Day.He has been approached by a number of home owners in NCQ and said they may have a case against the developers for breach of contract when they sold homes “fit for habitation when completed”.Langevin funded the flat in 2014 through some savings, a mortgage with a high-street bank and a £95,000 government loan under the Help to Buy scheme designed to help people without enough savings to get on the property ladder.Langevin believes that many other homes in the NCQ development were purchased on the Help to Buy scheme, which was heavily promoted by Galliard at the development’s launch.She has had no answer from Target HCA, which is administering the scheme, other than to say it is a “novel” request. “They are being evasive, because they know if they have to do this for me they have to do it for everyone who asks,” she said.Regardless of how much of the government loan she has to repay, Langevin is still subject to huge negative equity because the value of the flat has plummeted.She said she is at her wits’ end and suffering from stress over her situation. She said she can’t move out and rent to others because she would feel terrible “if they were caught in a fire”. It is also not permissible under her Help to Buy contract.She contacted the housing minister, Dominic Raab, but he did not reply. “I don’t think he cares about ordinary people,” she said. It is likely that thousands of private homeowners are in Langevin’s situation, with government data showing 301 blocks over 18 metres tall have Grenfell-type cladding, of which 130 are in the private sector and 13 are hospitals or schools. Of the public buildings, only seven have had their cladding replaced so far.A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “We have made clear that we want to see private sector landlords follow the lead of the social sector and not pass on the costs of essential cladding replacement to leaseholders.“We are keeping the situation under review and ministers are meeting industry representatives shortly to discuss this.”Campaigners said the cladding was causing financial ruin for homeowners.“The blight caused by Grenfell is national and the government doesn’t seem to be too bothered about that. So far, what we have heard from Greenwich and Croydon is just the tip of the iceberg,” said Martin Boyd, a trustee at the charity Leasehold Knowledge Partnership, a service that advises leaseholders on their rights over cladding and other issues.Galliard Homes declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bc02900b1907fcbf61529ccd20eb0562d42af86/1050_116_1288_773/master/1288.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c6bd69b46164f4ed104bd27e5d5228e5 1240w","title":"ben stokes ipl t20 england cricket joe root captain","story":"It’s 6pm at the Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore. A drowsy sun has already slunk below the stands, kites glide overhead and after three hours of intense training in the heat, where he has batted twice, thundered in with the ball for the first time in weeks and stayed late to work on his flying boundary catches, Ben Stokes strolls over for a chat.There is of course one almighty elephant in the ground. We both briefly acknowledge this but it remains just that. This is his first in-depth interview since the incident in Bristol on 25 September last year but regarding events that night Stokes must wait to have his say in court this summer after he and two other men pleaded not guilty to affray. For now it is only cricket, both England and Indian Premier League, that can be on the agenda in the Garden City.The Indian Premier League first, where the 26-year-old is in his second season and at his second side, Rajasthan Royals. Eoin Morgan, one of his two international captains, has recently credited the all-rounder’s MVP-winning stint with the runners-up Rising Pune Supergiant last year for “breaking down barriers” and causing the English invasion that has a record 12 players spread across six of the eight franchises.Stokes appreciates their presence in Twenty20’s great tamasha, rather than with their counties, is not to everyone’s taste back home. The subject of his £1.7m deal with Pune last year – a record for an overseas player – and new price tag at just a shade under, is one he squirms at. “Last year there was so much said about me and the money. I just shy away from it. I don’t want to come across as arrogant. I don’t know how to answer it. It’s just weird,” he says.Stokes is clearly enjoying his time with the Royals. The inaugural winners of the IPL in 2008, they are now trying to rebuild public trust in their first season back as the result of a two-year ban for the spot-fixing scandal that cost three players their careers. He has struck up a particular rapport with Shane Warne, the team’s mentor, while Jos Buttler is a familiar face in the ranks. But as is the case with England, all team-mates tend to gravitate towards him.His only off-field struggle in India has come from some of the commercial demands that pack out the schedule on non-match days. “They ask you to do things that are so far out of your comfort zone – it’s just not me,” he says, perhaps in reference to some lively Bollywood-style dancing of his that can be witnessed during the IPL’s numerous TV ad breaks.The feet are moving better on the field even if the returns do not yet jump off the page. His third match against Royal Challengers Bangalore – a high-scoring 19-run win on the day after the interview – is the most impactful yet, with a 21-ball 27 from No\u0026nbsp4, his first wicket of the campaign and a leaping boundary catch to remove Brendon McCullum that kickstarted the RCB struggle in their pursuit of 218.While the latter was a classic case of Stokes making the ridiculous look sublimely simple – his extra training 24 hours earlier sprung to mind as he sprung high – it is likely the bowling that will have given Stokes most satisfaction, purely for the fact he was charging in at full tilt for the first time in a long time.A pre-Christmas spell in New Zealand with Canterbury notwithstanding, the general lack of action leading into his return for England in February had affected his body. Bowling in the one-day series saw wickets follow but he found his legs seized up after spells. Then, just before the Tests that followed, some historical stress fractures in his lower back suddenly began to cause him grief and injections were required.Just 10 laboured overs were sent down in the two Tests that followed the jabs but Stokes says he is feeling himself again to prevent a recurrence he is remodelling his bowling action. The late step into the crease that pointed him to fine leg and left him needing to twist in order to straighten up is being eased out. He is happy with the results but the true test is in the middle.The return to the England camp – he has been restored to the side until the end of proceedings – was probably as smooth as he and his employers could have hoped for. Stokes says the squad’s response felt no different to before from his perspective – “it’s not like we hadn’t stayed in touch” – but admits watching his Test colleagues among them go down 4-0 in Australia was tough. “I lived every moment of the Ashes. I’m sure it was nowhere near the emotions of the guys out there but I was just as gutted.”Readjustment batting-wise took little time either, with one low-key score of 12 in the first one-dayer at Hamilton – “I was anxious. I was guilty of thinking too far ahead and trying to make an impression. It was like I was at the start of my career,” – before a less flustered unbeaten 63 steered Morgan’s side to a series-levelling win at Mount Maunganui.“I was really emotional after getting man of the match in that second game back. It was such a relief to perform and be there at the end. I had five minutes to myself after getting back to the dressing room, sat in my bubble and taking it all in. The lads appreciated that and gave me space. It was a great feeling.”“It’s all about what I’m going to do in the future. I just want to get us back to playing the way we want to play. We were so close to being one of the best teams in the world. We’ve slacked off in the past two years but knowing how close we were gives you that desire to get back there.”That slacking off, as he puts it, bottomed out with the 58 all out in Auckland – “It was like the pins in a bowling alley falling down in slow motion” – from which a 1-0 series defeat followed. From being one Test win away from holding all nine bilateral Test trophies in 2016, only for Pakistan to win at the Oval and square the series, England have five in the cabinet to match their world ranking of fifth.Root, Bayliss and the as-yet reformed selection panel have a job on their hands. The former is battling to turn half-centuries into three figures too – his last nine have gone unconverted – and it is a topic Stokes has been discussing with one of his new friends in India.“But the thing about Joe is he doesn’t bat for himself. If he thinks it is time to take a team down, he will go for it. That’s how he wants us to play as a team and as captain, he feels he has to set the standard. People can have a go at him but the bigger picture, that’s what he is trying to build. When it clicks – and that is coming – those scores will become 150s and 200s. Hopefully when people read what I have said here they will understand a bit more.”Doubtless much of the heat from the end of England’s sorry Test travails this winter was drawn by Australia’s ball-tampering scandal and before Stokes heads up to the dressing room at the Chinnaswamy, before his new team’s departure from the ground, his views on the topic are sought.“I’m keeping my mouth shut. Certain people said some things and it then comes back to get you …” he says, before stopping himself from elaborating on who and what he means. Given the aforementioned elephant, it is probably for the best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a372f794f94ff147e39720359e053fa8489f79f/0_103_3443_2066/master/3443.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=946dc874527a344b346ec63b35ed97ed 1240w","title":"my under 10 matches are the worst no end in sight to youth referee abuse","story":"While many acknowledge that the abuse and assault of referees is endemic in American sports culture, few people seem willing to do anything about itNearly every single day, a sports official becomes the victim of verbal abuse or physical assault. This isn’t just true of professional and collegiate referees – all of whom receive the protection of a security detail – but of the hundreds of thousands of referees who officiate youth and amateur recreational matches across the United States, many of whom are under 18 years of age.Referee administrator Tony Crush still remembers the first time he was physically assaulted while officiating a soccer match.At the time, Crush, then only 15 years old, began bantering with an adult league player after that player complained that Crush had failed to call a foul. The banter grew into a heated argument and, moments later, the player attacked Crush, knocking him temporarily unconscious.Stories like Crush’s take place on soccer fields and basketball courts and baseball diamonds across the United States: a 17-year-old frantically phones her father for help as a mob of angry parents gather around her car a 15-year-old girl sits dazed on the field after a grown man has put his hands on her chest and pushed her to the ground a 16-year-old picks himself up off the ground after being blindsided by a punch during a recreational soccer match.While many people acknowledge that the abuse and assault of referees is endemic in American sports culture, few people seem willing to do anything about it, and fewer still consider just how many of the referees on the receiving end of this abuse are still children.Many of the youngest and most inexperienced of these referees begin their officiating careers by working games at the youngest age levels. In theory, these assignments would provide young referees with the opportunity to learn their craft in a more stress-free environment than the one they might find in the more competitive older age groups. The reality, however, is that the younger age games often lead to the most referee abuse.“It is amazing to me how this would be considered child abuse if someone were yelling at their kid like that in a school setting or a work setting,” Hildman added.One former teenage referee wrote to the Guardian about his experiences refereeing under-11 and under-12 matches as a 16-year-old. In one particular match, a coach pushed him to the ground after a disagreement over a red card.The explanations for this abuse are myriad: parents feeling entitled to yell at the referee because of the escalating costs of youth sports the growing pressure to win in competitive youth sports parents, coaches, and players all expecting a level of officiating commensurate with the pros the broader society’s diminishing respect for authority figures.While there are many possible explanations for the rise in referee abuse, there are just as many potential solutions.In Michigan, for example, where amateur referee John Bieniewicz died after he was physically attacked by an adult player in 2015, activists in the referee community teamed up with state senator Morris Hood to try and pass legislation that would have created stiffer legal penalties for assaulting a referee. That legislation stalled despite the urgent testimony of Bieniewicz’s widow undaunted, Hood is reintroducing the bill this year.Yet even if Michigan were to enact stiffer penalties for referee assault, would that really be enough to change a sports culture that dehumanizes referees?“What is the moral compass that spectators can use to understand that their behavior, no matter what they perceive to be the blame of the situation, is crossing a moral line?” asked Chico Villarruel, a regional referee administrator for US Youth Soccer. “What is the civic discourse that we need to have that minimizes prejudice and racism and all of the other ‘-isms’ that we have in our world including the ‘-ism’ of the treatment of sports officials?”Such a civic discourse first requires a conversation between administrators, parents, coaches and players about the proper treatment of match officials, something that sports leagues across the United States are only beginning to incorporate into their programs.Other leagues and organizations are taking even more drastic measures. In Kentucky, one league has begun fining clubs $250 for every parent dismissed from a match for poor behavior, while another has gone even further, banning exhortations of any kind – positive or negative – from the sidelines.Villarruel believes that there may be an even simpler solution for changing the entire culture around youth and amateur sports in this country: empathy.“Ask parents and ask spectators to be a sports official for one year,” Villarruel said, “and maybe we’ll have a cultural change.”In England, one young referee was unwilling to wait for such a cultural change. After years of verbal and physical altercations with players, parents, and coaches, and deeply disaffected with the lack of response from the English Football Association, 18-year-old Ryan Hampson decided he had had enough.Last year, Hampson took the extraordinary step of calling on his fellow referees to go on strike. In March 2017, more than 2,000 referees across England took up Hampson’s call for a strike, earning the teenager an audience with some of the highest-ranking officials in the FA.“I’d say it takes a lot of guts to stand up and actually tackle this front on,” Hampson told the Guardian. “I’d say it can’t just be done by one person it’s got to be a team. There’s got to be a number of officials who will stand up and will do it and will bite the bullet and go for it and not back down. It takes someone who will genuinely have the determination to follow it through and not be frightened of any repercussions that could be possible from the authorities … saying, ‘No, I’ve had enough.’”In a political moment when teenagers across the country – from minority students in Chicago staging “die-ins” at City Hall to protest inequality in public education to the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School leading a national movement for stricter gun control laws – are organizing and protesting for their own protection, the idea of a strike by underage referees seems far less outlandish than it might have even six months ago.As Hampson points out, officiating for many is a paid job. If you wouldn’t accept verbal and physical abuse in the workplace, why would you accept it on the soccer field or on the basketball court or on the baseball diamond?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/928220a90061daa4b30b79cd2c514424dc4a1ecd/0_128_3543_2234/master/3543.jpg?w=3500\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fb90c3217a448f809a989e31ca5f4da 7000w","title":"share the dream the games that celebrated disability sports","story":"The 2018 Commonwealth Games was the most inclusive sporting event held to date, with 38 para medal events woven into the schedule alongside able-bodied events. Our photographer  Carly Earl met several of the starsThe 2018 Commonwealth Games was the most inclusive sporting event held to date, with 38 para medal events woven into the schedule alongside able-bodied events. Our photographer  Carly Earl met several of the starsShe is beaming with positivity, and not simply because she topped her T37 class, finishing fifth overall in the T38 final. At the Commonwealth Games she has felt a sense of inclusivity and support like nowhere else in sport.Indeed, for all the feats of athleticism, skill and determination seen in the past 11 days, arguably the most significant achievement has been the way para and able-bodied events have been seamlessly integrated to form a rich and highly watchable schedule. At the Commonwealth Games, even the medals table is a combination of able and para results.“It’s the best idea,” says Joseph of the shared format, which was introduced in 2002. “Being a para athlete, we look forward to the Commonwealth Games so much because here we’re just like any able-bodied person. We get to be with everyone else in the same environment. We don’t get that in the Paralympics and World Championships. It’s so great because it brings the focus on to para athletes. I love it.”What’s more, the attention has fallen on Joseph’s age and her talents rather than her disability: “I have messages saying, ‘You’re such an inspiration, you’re 15 years old and you’re competing with people who are 10 years older.’ It’s crazy,” she says. “And the athletes’ village couldn’t have been better. It was like home.”There were many tales of joy and woe on the track at the Carrara Stadium. Jessica Frotten of Canada crashed during the women’s T54 1,500m final while Madison De Rozario took gold for Australia her compatriot Kurt Fearnley took silver in men’s T54 1500m final, beaten by Canadian Alexandre Dupont by just 0.23 of a second.Humble, gregarious, apprehensive, confident, proud – whatever their disposition and whatever their chances of victory, the para athletes all shared a sense of positivity about the value of para sport.“Don’t look at disability, look at your ability,” Friana Kwevira told the media after winning bronze in the women’s F46 javelin, making her Vanuatu’s first ever Commonwealth Games medalist. “If I can make it, you can make it.”There was even a visually impaired photographer, Andrew Follows, and his guide dog, Leo, on the sidelines at the swimming and gymnastics to capture the action. He too shared their delight, saying his Games experience had been “absolutely epic”.In the para swimming, there was considerable success for Australian athletes. They claimed seven gold, contributing to an overall total of 73 medals alongside their able-bodied team-mates, thereby helping drive Australia to the top of the medal charts.Timothy Disken was one of the most remarkable competitors. Just six months ago he lay in a coma in Canada, with doctors unsure if he would survive emergency brain surgery. Disken suffers from hydrocephalus – the excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid on the brain. He roared back to fitness and claimed gold in both the 100m freestyle S9 and 100m breaststroke SB8. “I’m pretty on top of the world,” he said afterwards.In the lawn bowls, Ken Hanson made history as he became Australia’s oldest Commonwealth Games gold medal winner, aged 68. To do it he had to produce the shot of his life in the men’s B6B7B8 match, blasting away two Kiwi bowls from the jack, giving the Australians a last-gasp win.But it was not so much the stories of success that stood out as the spirit of togetherness that propelled the competitors. A fine example of this was in events that paired para and able-bodied entrants, such as Ann Muir, who operated as a “director” for her visually impaired team-mate Sue Curran, guiding her shots in. How fitting it was, then, that “Share the dream” was the motto of the Games."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/071b92d1b288a4c199ead3869c1a546abe84be03/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3c6f04c84f788ffb15e7224623d3b7ce 1240w","title":"cal crutchlow barry sheene motogp motorcycling","story":"In a universe of professional sportsmen and women happy to proclaim the incredible rigour of their winter training regimes, it was refreshing to hear Cal Crutchlow summarising his very different preparation for the MotoGP season a few minutes after climbing off his Honda in Argentina two weekends ago, having won the second race of the new campaign and shot to the top of the world championship standings.He spoke of spending the off-season on holiday in California with his wife and their one-year-old daughter. “It shows you don’t have to ride motorcycles all winter and do press-ups and pull-ups,” he said, “because I haven’t done one.”This is Crutchlow’s eighth season in MotoGP and perhaps it has taken him all that time to learn how to relax and make the most of his talent. His performance on the Rio Hondo circuit, in tricky conditions requiring the highest level of feel and intelligence, was that of a rider who has grown out of the years in which he always seemed to be having something to prove.On a chaotic day, when a drying track provoked a pre-start episode of chaos throughout the field over the choice of tyres, and which featured a performance of startling immaturity from the reigning world champion, Crutchlow was the one who kept his head. It was he who best assessed the changing nature of the asphaltrubber interface throughout the 24 laps and who took his victory, after a fierce four-way fight, with cool panache.He is 32 and did not achieve promotion to the top tier until he was 25. Contrast that with the most famous rider on the current grid, the seven-times champion Valentino Rossi, who was 21 when he graduated, or Marc Márquez, the champion, who was 20 when he won the first of his four titles and is only 25 (and rode on Sunday like a hot-headed teenager).Crutchlow also came into MotoGP from Superbikes rather than rising through the Moto3 and Moto2 categories, which offer a smoother ramp of preparation, and arrived at the top at a time when no British rider had won a grand prix for 30 years. There had been several decent prospects since Barry Sheene took his last victory in 1981 but none managed to make a significant impact. And he found himself on a grid packed with talent, from Rossi through Casey Stoner, Jorge Lorenzo, Dani Pedrosa and Andrea Dovizioso, all of whom won races during his first season.It was a little bit like Andy Murray trying to break into a top echelon occupied by Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic, and it took him a while to do it. Whereas the race winners were riding works machines, Crutchlow spent his first three seasons on a privately entered Yamaha run by one of the satellite teams. Gradually he worked his way up to become a challenger for podium places, despite some mishaps, and in the 2013 Dutch Grand Prix at Assen he landed his first pole position, going on to finish third, a few seconds behind Rossi and Márquez.For 2014 he announced a big move to Ducati, believing only a hook-up with a factory team would give him the chance of victories. After a year of mechanical unreliability and crashes on the Italian machines, however, he and the team parted company. Having gone from 12th to seventh to fifth in the championship standings in his three years, now he slumped to 13th, behind two younger Brits, Bradley Smith and Scott Redding.Needing to rebuild his career, he moved to another satellite outfit, the Monaco-based Team LCR. There he was given a factory-specification Honda RC213V, as used by Stoner and Márquez to win the world titles in 2012 and 2013. The rehabilitation took time and a third place in Argentina was the only top-three finish in a season which saw him haul himself back up to eighth in the standings.After a bad start to 2016, his fortunes were transformed not just by a win in wet conditions in the Czech Republic GP at Brno, ahead of Rossi and Márquez, but by a follow-up victory at Phillip Island in Australia after Márquez, the pole man, crashed on the first lap. This was the first time a British rider had won two grands prix in a season since Sheene in 1979.If 2017 was a year of marking time, with a single third place and six other top-five finishes, this season has started on a very different note. And now, after adding the points for fourth place in Qatar to his win in Argentina, he is the first British rider since Sheene 39 years ago to sit on top of the world standings.A huge draw in many countries, MotoGP will once again pack out Silverstone in August without managing to attract a wider British audience. This is a particular mystery since, season after season, it offers the most spectacular racing to be seen in any form of modern motor sport, with a compelling range of personalities and nationalities among the riders, who retain a sense of human agency long lost to Formula One.On Sunday, for instance, Crutchlow and his Honda were fighting for the podium places with an Australian on a Ducati, a Frenchman on a Yamaha and a Spaniard on a Suzuki.As long as he is on a non-works machine, the odds are still heavily against the Coventry-born rider mounting a season-long challenge for the title. But when he and his rivals meet again this weekend at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas, the Englishman will have a new status to defend."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a19e744236d19edeb1a8e60a2a9ea97d45e5b61c/151_229_4165_2499/master/4165.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8c4c899160d777de052aedb6d5765256 1240w","title":"cornwall once in a lifetime stack stevens stadium for cornwall","story":"Amid the onrushing tide of worrying world news stories, the outcome of a 123-person vote in Truro’s county hall might seem relatively trivial. If you live in Cornwall or have the faintest interest in the growth of professional club rugby union, however, Tuesday is as defining a moment as any in the county’s sporting history.No pressure on Cornwall’s councillors but the decision on whether or not to approve council funding for the proposed new Stadium for Cornwall goes way beyond sport. If you had a once-in-a-lifetime chance to boost your local region’s economy, offer hope to those young athletes not destined to become world-class surfers or sailors and create a lasting community legacy, would you grasp it? Or would you take the view that public money allocated for development is better spent on something other than a shiny ballpark which may never host sustainable top-tier football or rugby?Not all those voting are sports fans and political pressures also mean the vote could still go either way. The positive argument runs as follows: the council says ‘Yes’ and approves £3m of funding towards the stadium project, which it remains confident the government will match. This would remove the funding logjam that has delayed the much-debated £14.3m project for years.An initial 6,000-capacity complex with a 4G artificial pitch would be in use for 365 days a year, shared by Cornish Pirates, Truro City FC and Truro and Penwith College. There would also be a health club and Cornwall’s biggest conference facility attached, all on a site with excellent transport links to the rest of the far south-west.Crucially, the money is not being erted from stretched social care budgets or pothole-repair funds. It is ring-fenced development cash which, by law, cannot be used for anything other than the economic regeneration of one of the country’s poorer regions. Among previous beneficiaries of such funds have been the Eden Project, Tate St Ives and Newquay airport, all with the aim of convincing people it is no longer necessary to pass the Duchy on the left-hand side en route to somewhere better.The timing, from English rugby’s perspective, could hardly be more significant. On Thursday the Professional Game Board is scheduled to meet to discuss, among other things, the ongoing future of promotion and relegation to and from the Premiership. No one is suggesting the Pirates would thrive in the Premiership right now but imagine that potential avenue being forever closed. What price then a brave new world for the athletic sons and daughters of ancient Kernow?Perhaps the best person to consult on this cat’s cradle of related issues is Mark Evans, the former Saracens and Harlequins chief executive who has been assisting the bid. Like everyone else, Evans is unsure which way the Truro vote will go but is convinced a ‘No’ will kill stone dead any chance of professional club rugby taking root in the rugby-mad far-west.“If it doesn’t happen this time it’ll never happen unless a billionaire comes out of nowhere. The Pirates will go back to being a level 2 or 3 side with very little aspiration, and another heartland goes.”“Are we prepared to say the English league will always be propped up by extremely wealthy people? If all the revenue goes out of the changing room door,the game doesn’t grow. All that money could go into marketing the game or improving facilities. Some club ticket prices are getting ridiculous. We’ve got too many games which leads to too many injuries, which leads to oversized squads, which leads to a Championship that is totally dysfunctional. What we are doing to our second tier is nothing short of shameful. All the game has done is ridden the wave of higher and higher media rights. To which I would say a rising tide floats all boats.”Evans points to Australian Rules football, which has invested hugely in places previously without an elite AFL club, and thinks rugby should follow suit – how about a Brighton-based side, for example? – if the numbers stack up. “I want the game to be bigger via a managed-growth model, with a closed league and a percentage of central television money syphoned off to build up new markets. Premiership Rugby can’t have it both ways. They can’t say we want to be independent and control our own destiny and not have a growth strategy. I defy anybody to stand up and say: ‘This is working.’”Which is why this week’s decision in Truro resonates far beyond Penzance, Redruth, Camborne and every other Cornish rugby town. Here’s hoping that Hellfire Stadium, Stack Stevens Park or the Vickery Arena receives its green light, even in these uncertain economic times. Build it, to borrow from Kevin Costner in Field of Dreams, and they will surely come.Here are just a few of the fine, prolific wingers who have played club rugby in France this century: Bryan Habana, Joe Rokocoko, Nemani Nadalo, Drew Mitchell, Juan Imhoff, Sitiveni Sivivatu, Vincent Clerc, Cedric Heymans, Christophe Dominici, Emile Ntamack. It is some achievement, therefore, for Chris Ashton to have broken the record for inidual tries scored in the competition, eclipsing the previous mark of 21 by Clermont’s Napolioni Nalaga. Ashton, 31, has also been required to play 10 games at full-back and 11 on the wing as his coach Fabien Galthie wryly observed: ‘He has been a good find, eh?’ At this rate Eddie Jones will be tempted to dust down the ‘exceptional-circumstances clause’ relating to the availability of English-qualified players based overseasThe Champions Cup semi-finals. Welcome to the Pro 14’s finest hour, with three sides in the last four and an all-Irish final in Bilbao next month if Leinster can beat Scarlets in Dublin and Munster defeat Racing 92 in Bordeaux. Those who fancy Racing and the retiring Dan Carter to progress are forgetting the last time the Irish province featured in a semi-final at Bordeaux’s Stade Chaban-Delmas in 2000. Munster beat Toulouse 31-25 in a game so gripping it still ranks among the greatest European knock-out games.

On the last day before the applications deadline, she decided to go for it. “That’s when I got the courage,” she recalled. “I decided I’m going to be brave and bite this bullet. But I didn’t have an internet connection.”Fortunately a friend at a university in Johannesburg stepped in and she hit the button with just minutes to spare. “It was, ‘I hope nothing goes wrong when I click submit.’ There was this mini-celebration when I got the confirmation.” Now the last-gasp effort has paid off: out of more than 20,000 applicants from 191 countries, Moeti is one of 20 inaugural Obama Foundation fellows.The announcement, made via the Guardian on Monday, is the latest step in Obama’s political afterlife. The former president has spoken out against Donald Trump’s policies on only a handful of occasions, keen to avoid the criticism that he is leading the “resistance” or crowding out other Democrats. He is often at work at his Washington office writing a presidential memoir.But he has long taken a particular interest in the next generation of leaders in America and around the world. Speaking at a conference in Japan last month, Obama said he aspired to create “a million young Barack Obamas or Michelle Obamas” who would pick up the baton in what he described as the “relay race that is human progress”.The Obama Foundation describes the fellowship as a two-year non-residential programme that will bring together leaders who are “creating transformational change on many of the world’s most pressing problems”.The fellows are engaged in areas including healthcare, community organising, technology and the arts. Their work includes empowering parents and teachers to improve schools, ensuring deaf children have equal access to literacy tools and engaging with the healthcare system to treat addiction.Obama writes in an accompanying email: “These 20 leaders, representing 11 countries, are tackling some of the toughest challenges in their communities. They are doing the hard work – not for recognition, often without enough resources – because they have a vision of the world as it should be: a little more just, less isolated, more connected.”He adds: “I couldn’t be prouder of this group, and I can’t wait to learn from them and watch them grow over the next two years. The Foundation will facilitate hands-on trainings, leadership development, coaching, and personalized plans and strategies to help these leaders scale the work they’ve already started.”For nearly four years she has run amandla.mobi, a digital platform that has mobilised more than 200,000 people around various issues including police brutality and housing, and has a particular focus on black women in poverty.Moeti welcomed the fellowship’s aim to break down cultural barriers between activists.“It’s quite meaningful in this moment, when the right is rising, that the first US black president is doing something like this. I’m really looking forward to meeting the other fellows and finding out what they are working on.”Another 2018 fellow is Zarlasht Halaimzai, who came to Britain as a refugee from Afghanistan when she was 11. After training in psychotherapy and counselling, she visited the Calais “Jungle” camp in France and was struck by the lack of volunteers who could speak the refugees’ languages. She is the co-founder of the Refugee Trauma Initiative (RTI), which gives psychological help to thousands of refugees traumatised by war, torture and displacement.Halaimzai, 36, also applied for the fellowship on the last day before applications closed after being tipped off by a friend. “I’m thrilled to be part of it,” she said from northern Greece, where the RTI does much of its work. “It feels exactly the right thing for me.”The Obamas had been a personal inspiration, she recalled. “When he was elected it was the first time I felt, as a minority in the UK, that I could shoot for the stars because the precedent had been set. Their commitment to empowering people and changing things in a creative way is great.”The foundation said its selection of the 20 fellows weighed various factors including “geographic ersity, commitment to the Obama Foundation’s values, and existing work”.The first gathering will be in Chicago next month. There will be three more during the two-year programme, and fellows also get institutional support and are likely to meet Obama. Applications for its 2019 fellows class will open in the summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e8241a47c5971917604914feae373ebaf54885a0/66_234_1337_802/master/1337.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=82e683bec083e27128832807e2d46212 1240w","title":"belgium comes to terms with human zoos of its colonial past","story":"Sixty years ago, Belgium set up a live display of people from Congo for the 1958 world fair. Now the country is rethinking that legacySixty years ago on Tuesday, Belgium staged the opening of the 1958 world fair, a glittering 200-day celebration of postwar social, cultural and technological advances.It is said to retain an “important place in the collective memory of the Belgian nation”. A series of events are being held in the Atomium, the futuristic landmark built for the spectacle, in recognition.Yet as the Belgian capital indulges in nostalgia, one exhibit staged at the time is not being revisited: a live display of black men, women and children in “native conditions” laid on for the education and amusement of white Europeans.It was the world’s last “human zoo”.As of 1958, Belgium still ruled Congo, a piece of territory some 80 times its own size, and a source of great pride to the country. The mineral-rich central African state was not only hugely economically rewarding but garlanded Belgium, a small European nation in the shadows of Britain and France, with standing in the world.Expo ’58 was seen by Belgian politicians as a chance to burnish this achievement, sealing what was seen as a special bond with Belgian Congo.At the foot of the Atomium, a rejoinder to Paris’s Eiffel Tower, and the centre piece of the exhibition, eight hectares of land peppered by seven pavilions were dedicated to the themes of mining in Congo, its arts, transport and agriculture, among others. It was known as the Kongorama. In its three hectares of tropical gardens, Congolese men, women and children were put on show day-after-day, in “traditional” dress behind a bamboo perimeter fence.Human zoos were in no way a novelty to the west and had been held regularly earlier in the century in London, Paris, Oslo and Hamburg. In New York in 1906, a young Congolese man with sharpened teeth was given a home in the monkey house in the Bronx zoo.In the summer of 1897, King Leopold II had imported 267 Congolese to Brussels to be on show around his colonial palace in Tervuren, east of Brussels, paddling in their canoes on the royal lakes 1.3 million Belgians, out of a population of 4 million, visited, walking over a rope bridge to get the best view.That summer was bitterly cold and seven of the Congolese died of pneumonia and influenza, their bodies dumped in an unmarked mass grave in the local cemetery. But such was the popularity of the zoo and other exhibits that a permanent exhibition was to be later established at the site. Initially called the Museum of the Congo, it is now the Royal Museum for Central Africa.The 1958 exhibit was smaller in scale, but similar in content. A “typical” village was set up, where the Congolese spent their days carrying out their crafts by straw huts while they were mocked by the white men and women who stood at the edge.“If there was no reaction, they threw money or bananas over the closure of bamboo,” one journalist wrote at the time of the spectators.Another report told of people gossiping about “seeing the negros at the zoological gardens”.The Congolese on display were among 598 people – including 273 men, 128 women and 197 children, a total of 183 families – brought over from Africa to staff the wider fair.The colonial office was “very nervous about what this stay of such an unprecedented number of Congolese in Belgium might do”, according to Dr Sarah Van Beurden, a historian of central Africa.But housed in a dedicated building isolated from the Expo from which they could be bussed in and out, the Congolese complained of cramped accommodation, the strict limitations on visitors or excursions from the building, and, of course, daily abuse at the fair.By July, the Congolese artists and artisans, and their families, could take no more and some went back home. The human zoo, as the Congolese recognised it to be, closed down, and the rest of the fair carried on.Such a zoo was not to be staged anywhere again, and in January 1959, Congo won its independence. But for Guido Gryseels, the director general at the Royal Museum for Central Africa (RMCA), the permanent exhibition that grew from 1897, combating the prejudices that were at the core of the zoo and still, he says, persist, is the focus of his working life.On 1 December, following a €75m renovation, the RMCA will reopen five years after it last opened its doors to the public. There is a new visitors centre and a vast underground space that has doubled the museum’s exhibition area to 11,000 sq metres. But beyond the physical transformation, a much more significant change is about to be undertaken.When Gryseels took over the museum in 2001, the permanent exhibition had barely changed since the 1920s, he said. Along with Leopold II’s double L motifs looking down on visitors in almost every room, and the royal quotations celebrating the higher moral plane of the colonisation, the story that was told was of Belgium bringing light where there was darkness.“For 100 years we have been a colonial institution”, Gryseels said. “For most Belgians their first encounter with Africa is our museum. The initial impression of Africa by most Belgians was made here in this museum, and that is that the white person is better than the black person. We were there to civilise them. The Africans we portray here are naked with a spear without a culture of their own.”A reason for the inertia at the museum, he believes, is that in reality Belgian society has not wanted to rethink its colonial past. “It is very emotional here because every Belgian family has a family member who worked in Congo. All of them. A missionary, a teacher, an administrator. You ask any Belgian and they all have. So it is a very emotional debate.”There are some voices from the Congolese diaspora calling for the “decolonisation” of his institution, and its closure. But Gryseels says his job in the next nine months is to tell a new story about Belgium in the Congo.On the opening day, the minister of foreign affairs is expected to give a speech on Belgium’s colonial past in the presence of the royal family. “We have a responsibility for cultivating an attitude that a lot of Belgians have of being superior to black people”, Gryseels said. “And that is changing. But it is going to take a while.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad9660332dd870a443a851bd922b03f1f87e2d52/0_0_5313_3188/master/5313.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0fb846d13d70c78364904f370a61bdbc 1240w","title":"brits living in rest of eu are mainly of working age not pensioners","story":"ONS figures disprove popular view of British migrants retiring to sunnier parts of EuropeThe majority of British migrants living in Europe are of working age, even in Spain, the most popular EU country for UK citizens to settle in, new figures show.The Office for National Statistics data contradicts the widely held belief that most Britons in Europe are pensioners sunning themselves in southern France or Spain.ONS figures show two-thirds of the 784,900 British citizens recorded as long-term residents in the EU, excluding the UK and Ireland, are aged between 15 and 64 and more of them live in Spain than any other country. Estimates using data from the Labour Force Survey and the 2011 European censuses put the number of British people resident long-term in Spain at 293,500.France is the next most popular country to live in, with 152,900, followed by Germany, with 96,500, and the Netherlands with 45,300.The data has been published as part of the last of a series of ONS reports called Living Abroad: British residents living in the EU, designed to build a picture of those outside the UK who are affected by Brexit. Ireland has been excluded from the report partly because British citizens in Ireland and Irish citizens in the UK will not be affected by changes to citizens’ rights after Brexit.The report uses UN migrant data to show that, when it comes to emigration, the UK is the least Europhile nation in Europe. It came bottom when comparing the proportion of the population emigrating to another EU country, just behind Malta and Croatia.Of the EU countries, citizens of Luxembourg are most likely to move to another state in the bloc. That is likely to reflect its size and geographical location close to biggercities such as Brussels, Paris and Frankfurt.“Spain continues to be the most desirable location for the three quarters of a million Brits living in the EU. However, the EU as a whole is not the most popular destination for British expats, with more than half preferring to live in English-speaking countries,” said Jay Lindop, the deputy director of migration statistics at the ONS. For retirement, Spain is still the No 1 destination for Brits, followed by Portugal and Bulgaria, which rocketed up the league of nations attractive to British and Irish people just before the financial crash because of cheap property in Black Sea resorts.Among the countries with most British children under 15 are Luxembourg, Slovakia, France and Belgium.

It has found a hoard believed to be linked to the Danish king Harald Gormsson, better known as “Harry Bluetooth”, who reigned from around AD958 to 986.Braided necklaces, pearls, brooches, a Thor’s hammer, rings and up to 600 chipped coins were found, including more than 100 that date back to Bluetooth’s era, when he ruled over what is now Denmark, northern Germany, southern Sweden and parts of Norway.“This trove is the biggest single discovery of Bluetooth coins in the southern Baltic Sea region and is therefore of great significance,” the lead archaeologist, Michael Schirren, told national news agency DPA.The oldest coin is a Damascus dirham dating to 714 while the most recent is a penny dating to 983.The find suggests that the treasure may have been buried in the late 980s – also the period when Bluetooth was known to have fled to Pomerania, where he died in 987.“We have here the rare case of a discovery that appears to corroborate historical sources,” said the archaeologist Detlef Jantzen. Bluetooth is credited with unifying Denmark. The Viking-born king also turned his back on old Norse religion and introduced Christianity to the Nordic country.But he was forced to flee to Pomerania after a rebellion led by his son Sven Gabelbart. Bluetooth’s lasting legacy is found today in smartphones and laptops – the wireless Bluetooth technology is named after him, and the symbol is composed of the two runes spelling out his initials RB."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3458229.1523457216!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"travel insurance you really really don t want to leave without it","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“All those who don’t bother packing their travel insurance are making a mistake. The mere sight of the medical bills that can be incurred as a result of an overseas illness would be enough to give you a heart attack.” File photograph: iStockPhotoMore than half of the Irish people who leave this country every year don’t bother with travel insurance.This is despite the fact that it is one of the very few insurance products that has not spiralled in price in recent years, while not having it could easily cost you an arm and a leg and make a difficult situation immeasurably worse.Many of those with private health insurance policies which routinely cover overseas emergency healthcare figure they don’t need it, while those travelling within the EU where public health systems can be readily availed of at no cost are similarly disinclined.But all those who don’t bother packing their travel insurance are making a mistake. The mere sight of the medical bills that can be incurred as a result of an overseas illness would be enough to give you a heart attack, particularly if you are travelling to the US.If you have your appendix removed there, you will be out of pocket by more than €30,000. A minor cardiac event will cost at least €40,000 and a bad heart attack could cost you about €200,000. An angiogram will cost €25,000, and if you have to stay in an intensive care unit you can expect to wake up to a heart-stopping bill of €5,500 per night. An air ambulance to repatriate you could top €100,000.While private health insurance and the benefits of being an EU citizen will take some of the sting out of falling ill, neither will help you if you have to cancel your holiday or curtail it because someone close to you has fallen ill or, heaven forbid, died. Neither will be of much use if you are the victim of a crime while abroad. You will also have to stump up if you or someone you are travelling with needs to be repatriated in a non-conventional way.With all that in mind – and ahead of the start of the summer holidays – we thought we’d draw up a list of dos and don’ts when it comes to sorting out your travel insurance.1. Do take out your out travel insurance as soon as you book your trip, or take on an annual multi-trip policy if you are planning to take more than two trips overseas in any given year. A significant number of claims are down to changing family circumstances or a bereavement, and you have no idea when such things will happen.In an analysis of its own claims data since 2012, AA Travel Insurance found that on average, 30 per cent of claims made each year are lodged as a result of the holiday-goer needing to cancel or curtail their holiday pre-departure.“It’s very easy to fall into the trap of assuming you only need travel insurance while you’re actually abroad and leaving it until the very last minute before your departure to purchase cover,” says the AA’s Conor Faughnan. “Unfortunately, taking that approach can prove exceptionally risky as you could be left with a significant hole in your wallet if you’re forced to cancel your holiday at short notice for any reason.”2. Don’t take out a policy sold by tour operators, as they tend to be a lot more expensive than those sourced elsewhere. If you are booking a holiday with a tour operator you might be told that you will get additional peace of mind if you book the insurance with the tour operator also, as their reps overseas will have all the details of your policy should things go wrong. But in an era of digital communications, you should be able to access all the documentation you need handily enough on your smartphone.3. Do declare any pre-existing conditions that you have when taking out a policy, as you do not want to give the insurer any excuse not to pay out in the event that you fall ill as a result of that condition. And remember that if you have the results of serious tests or investigations hanging over you, it might be advisable to let the insurer know there is an issue. If you don’t, a subsequent claim could be rejected. If you have health insurance that includes medical cover when overseas, you will most likely not have to pay any additional premium for many pre-existing conditions.4. Don’t ignore the small print. Look at the size of the excesses and the exclusions. Insurance companies don’t get rich by giving money away and they sometimes do their best to make claims as hard as they possibly can. They also make the benefits of their policies crystal clear and hide the exclusions in very small print. For instance, phones are not covered in many cases, while other valuables can lose their cover if they are not with you at all times. And, if you hadn’t been storing your passport in a hotel safe when it is stolen, you can almost certainly forget about making a claim for its theft from your hotel room.5. Do use this handy trick. The documentation attached to a normal travel insurance policy is more than 15,000 words. The dense, dull prose makes it almost impossible to read. Rather than reading it in full, download a PDF version or copy the text into Microsoft Word and search for “not covered”, “excluded” and “exclusions”. At least that will give you a sense of what not covered by your policy.6. Don’t forget your European Health Insurance Card (Ehic). If you are travelling in Europe, it gives you access to public health services at no cost and, as most of the countries in the EU have a better public health system than we do, you should never worry about using it. If you have a smartphone, download the Ehic app to help you navigate overseas health systems. Remember, your card needs to be renewed every five years. And don’t ever pay for the card. Some sites will try charging for the service, but it is free through the official site, ehic.ie7. Do remember that some companies will reject any claim for a cancellation or curtailment if it is down to a pre-existing condition, even if the condition endures for years. So if you have an elderly close relative who was diagnosed with a serious illness several years previously and they pass away or become gravely ill while you are overseas, the cost of returning home may not be covered.8. Don’t forget to tell the police if you are the victim of a crime overseas. If you do not have a police report, you will not be entertained by an insurer. You will also need to make the official complaint quickly. If you leave a police report for longer than 24 hours, an insurance company might view your claim with scepticism.9. Do take a photograph of your passport and email it to yourself before you leave home. If it is stolen, having all the details on your phone makes it easier to get an emergency replacement. The reason you need to email it is to cover yourself in case the phone is stolen too.10. Don’t expect your insurance to cover natural disasters and the like. Some of the cheaper policies do not cover travel rearrangement expenses, accommodation and cancellations relating to “natural disasters” outside of weather disruption. If you want travel disruption cover, you will have to pay more for it, although not a whole lot – and such an add-on might only cost €15.“No doubt you know that Intana in Kilkenny run VHI Travel Claims,” started a mail from a reader called Mary. We’re not going to lie, we did not know that. But that is neither here nor there. Mary phoned them “a few days after my consultation with my GP and asked for a claim form, which arrived the next day. When I was speaking with the Intana staff member they asked me a few questions, nothing intrusive – their main concern (and I fully appreciate this) is that I was “well and stable” when I made my bookings – and they sincerely wished me well in my recovery.”Throughout February and March she phoned VHI MultiTrip multiple times with various queries about their form. “Each staff member I spoke to was professional, helpful and kind – which is so so important to me, as I am unwell. At one stage I phoned and asked to speak to their centre manager, and congratulated him on the service from his staff. I nominate each and every one of the staff I have spoken to for customer service people of the year. My premium with VHI MultiTrip is €58 .... I would pay 10 times that for the kindness I’ve received from the Intana staff.”What we give with one hand, we take away with the other. Catherine O’Flynn and husband both have VHI health cover. Their son has an international policy as he lives in the UK, and all three are long-standing VHI members.“I have had multi-travel insurance over many years with different companies – Woodchester, ” she says. Not long ago she set up a multi-trip policy with the VHI’s travel insurance department. “I assumed I was getting travel insurance, such as I had held over many years. Thats not how it has worked out.”She and her husband travelled to Rome on February 22nd and were due to return to Dublin on March 1st. Their flight home with Aer Lingus was cancelled as a result of the great snow – and rescheduled for four days later.“We are organised people, and decided to phone the VHI travel insurance department, expecting routine advice on how to claim for the four extra nights in the hotel and expenses for the extra unwanted period of time. We were quite simply stunned to be told that essentially, this is a health multi-trip policy with a payment of €40 for first number of hours and then €15 per day after that, a pittance.”She rang the VHI a second time to complain about what she believes is the mis-selling of a product. “We happened to come across several Irish people ‘stranded’ in Rome who were quite confident their lovely VHI multi-trip policy would cover their hotel and expenses arising from the extra stay.“A barrister friend has just told me he rang VHI MultiTrip, as he is travelling shortly and he, like us, had laboured under the impression he actually had travel insurance. He is making alternative arrangements for a trip coming up shortly. He rang because we told him of our dreadful experience with VHI MultiTrip travel insurance.”When we contacted the VHI, a spokeswoman said that as with many travel insurance policies, weather events that are sometimes referred to as an act of God are typically not covered by policies. She said cancellation and curtailment, crime and other elements of cover found in other policies were also contained within the VHI travel insurance policy.A couple of weeks ago, Pricewatch attended a Senior Times expo in Cork. The event was dedicated to things of interest to an older audience. One of the things that came up more than once was the difficulty many older people have in getting travel insurance. The refrain we heard repeatedly was that people are living longer and staying healthy for longer, and just because they hit a certain arbitrary age they don’t feel like their horizons should be shortened by outside forces.But too often they are.Ageism is rife in the travel insurance sector. Someone who tries to get travel insurance at 66 can often pay twice as much as someone aged 65, even though there is no difference in the level of risk the two people pose to companies. Someone who hits 70 or 75 will be told they can’t get any insurance at all with many companies.The European Court of Justice ruled that it was discriminatory and illegal to price car insurance based on gender a few years back, but no such restrictions apply when it comes to a person’s age.Companies can just refuse to offer a quote for someone once they hit a certain age, and there is no comeback.Meanwhile, there are companies that make it their business to offer travel insurance to older people. There is oktotravelinsurance.ie and goodtogoinsurance.eu, which you most likely will never have heard of, and the AA, which you most certainly will have heard of, while the VHI covers most of the travelling public in Ireland aged between 70 and 80.There can be restrictions on pre-existing conditions, and many insurers will insist policy-holders have private medical insurance. Age Action Ireland has a comprehensive list of the companies that insure older people - although it does make it clear that it is endorsing none of the companies and as with most things it is very important that you do your homework and are sure you are getting what you are paying for before you agree to anything.Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Michael Hamilton says his brother was not homeless and \u0026lsquowas dead a long time\u0026rsquoOfficer\u0026rsquos left thumb dislocated after he was pushed and punched in the faceDon Hannon, who donated part of liver to his sister, is first to complete The Ireland WayFormer-Irish player Paddy Wallace says fans feel they have been \u0026lsquoleft in dark\u0026rsquo over decisionNew statistics show Garda has been overstating number of sex crimes reportedCorporate enforcement director expected to argue inquiry is of public interestIncident happened when the woman intervened after a group of male passengers became rowdySuspect assaulted taxi driver with knife, forced him to drive over Border to DonegalGirl was struck in Kilcoole by light coloured saloon car that failed to stop after collisionAnyone seeing images of chemical attack in Douma would be \u0026lsquosick to their stomach\u0026rsquo\u0026lsquoWe were left to our own devices and no matter how much we tried to support her, we are now experiencing the greatest dread of all.\u0026rsquoMet \u0026Eacuteireann issues two warnings with conditions set to improve later this weekBusinesses will close if cars are not allow access Patrick St, organisation warns\u0026lsquoAll tools and incentives are there\u0026rsquo for developers to build more homes \u0026ndash MurphyWithout regular meetings relationships will decline, according to the TaoiseachMs Justice Aileen Donnelly query around rule of law in Poland gets \u0026lsquoexpedited\u0026rsquo statusCorporate enforcement body to claim to High Court inquiry will serve public interestSaying it with flowers \u0026ndash how a florist got her life back after tragic incidentAlleged misuse concerned payments for maintenance and engineering worksRape Crisis Centre concerned at new errors uncovered in sex crimes data since 2003Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":null,"title":"us uk and france launch strikes on syria","story":"  April 14, 2018US ambassador to UN says US \u0026lsquolocked and loaded\u0026rsquo if Syrians further use chemical weapons   April 16, 2018European ministers hold off from joining expected US measures against Russia Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3462566.1523813034!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mps could delay brexit with final deal renegotiation demand","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople’s Vote: the MPs Caroline Lucas, Layla Moran, Chuka Umunna and Anna Soubry want a referendum on the final Brexit deal. Photograph: Ben StansallAFPGettyMPs could delay Brexit if they are unhappy with a final deal by sending the British government back to Brussels to renegotiate it, according to a new analysis of the role of parliament in the process.A report by the Institute for Government, a think tank close to Whitehall, rejects the assertion by Theresa May’s government that MPs will face a choice between endorsing the deal or leaving the EU with no agreement at all.“The government has a massive political incentive to talk up the chaos that would ensue if parliament did anything other than approve its deal. It is not surprising, therefore, to hear ministers arguing that the only alternative is to leave the EU without a deal – meaning no transition period and no legal guarantees for UK and EU citizens,” said Raphael Hogarth, one of the report’s authors.“The facts, however, are messier. If parliamentarians object to a particular bit of the deal, or to all of it, they could ask the government to renegotiate. The real questions then would be political: could the present government survive this, and would the EU 27 be prepared to return to the table?”The UK and the EU hope to reach agreement by October on two major documents outlining the terms of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the union and its future relationship with the European Union.The withdrawal agreement, a treaty setting out the terms of the UK’s exit for the short to medium term, will have the force of international law once it is signed and ratified. The second document is the “framework for a future relationship”, a political declaration on the terms of the UK’s long-term relationship with the EU.The government has promised to put the withdrawal agreement and future framework, together, to a “meaningful vote” in parliament. If the motion is approved it will be followed by a Withdrawal Agreement and Implementation Bill, which will enshrine the agreement in British law.The Institute for Government report says that, although MPs will not be able to amend the withdrawal agreement itself, they can attach amendments to the “meaningful vote” motion obliging the government to seek a better deal.“MPs can force ministers back to the negotiating table and, if they do, the government’s timetable could be unachievable. If MPs were to send ministers back to Brussels to ask for significant changes to the deal, it is likely that Brexit would have to be delayed,” said Hannah White, another of the report’s authors.More than 1,000 people attended the launch in London on Sunday of the People’s Vote, a campaign to put the Brexit deal to the people in a referendum. MPs from four parties were at the launch, including the Conservative Anna Soubry, Chuka Umunna of Labour, the Greens’ Caroline Lucas and the Liberal Democrat Layla Moran.“We have got to get a majority in the House of Commons for the proposition of this people’s vote,” Mr Umunna said. “That means at the very least my party, the Labour Party, needs to be true to its values and support this.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orceThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3462394.1523798421!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"washington we need an exorcist","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Exorcist: William Friedkin at the steps where he filmed his horror film’s climatic scene, in the Georgetown neighbourhood of Washington. Photograph: Gabriella DemczukNew York TimesWhen you’ve got a demonic child in Washington splattering dark stinking bile, croaking gibberish, spewing vulgar personal attacks, lying to sow confusion, whining about the unfairness of the attempts of righteous men to compel the diabolical behaviour and head-spinning outbursts to stop, who do you call? The demon-buster himself, of course: William Friedkin, director of The Exorcist.Before Donald Trump became president the most frightening thing that happened in the US capital was The Exorcist, which brags on its DVD cover that it’s the scariest film of all time. It could well be, if the measure is moviegoers putting down their popcorn in unison when Linda Blair gushes green vomit. “That was oatmeal – the pea soup was just for colouring,” the 82-year-old Friedkin tells me as we have lunch at 1789 in Georgetown, Washington, a restaurant opposite the steep concrete steps where Jason Miller’s tortured Fr Karras fell to his death in a violent struggle with the demon.Friedkin offers an eerie connection to the Trump White House, noting that he edited the film at 666 Fifth Avenue, the accursed Manhattan building with the Number of the Beast at the centre of Jared Kushner’s money problems. The book and screenplay were written by William Peter Blatty, inspired by a news story he heard about in a religious class: the 1949 case of a 14-year-old boy in a Maryland suburb of Washington.Objects appeared to move around on their own in the boy’s bedroom, and he was violent and speaking Latin phrases. The boy, a Lutheran who grew up to be an engineer at Nasa, underwent an exorcism, first with a priest from Georgetown University and then with priests in St Louis.After studying up on the case Friedkin has decided it was “jive”. “It just doesn’t hold water,” he says, eating asparagus soup that looks enough like what came out of Linda Blair’s mouth to make me a little queasy.Friedkin’s career peaked in the early 1970s with The Exorcist and another blockbuster, The French Connection. Eventually he felt so out of touch with a Hollywood possessed by comic books and sci-fis that he began directing operas. Now he has returned to the subject that haunts him with a documentary called The Devil and Father Amorth, opening this month.Friedkin used a handheld camera to film an interview with Fr Amorth, the chief Vatican exorcist, who worried that “Satan rules the world” and was in the Vatican. He died in 2016, at 91. The director, who had never seen an exorcism, also talked the priest into letting him film the exorcism of an Italian architect named Christina with whom he had done the ancient ritual many times.“It was harrowing,” Friedkin says. “These five strong guys are holding her down. They’re sweating. Fr Amorth told me that during one of the exorcisms she accused him of his sins and they were real.”Friedkin took this footage to neurosurgeons and psychiatrists, and one psychiatrist challenged it, saying Christina did not show “the classic symptoms” of possession, such as her head turning 360 degrees and her body levitating.“I said, ‘Doctor, we made that up,’” Friedkin recalls dryly. “Blatty invented what we think of as possession and exorcism today, and I had to find a way to film it. Fr Amorth never encountered stuff like that, but he encountered other extraordinary occurrences and personality changes and voice changes. But there was no levitation or head spinning.”The film-maker says that for his documentary he did nothing to amplify the guttural growl of Christina, which evokes the terrifying voice used by Mercedes McCambridge, which was dubbed in for Blair’s in the possession scenes.“When she breathed into the mic you’d hear five or six sounds come out at once, like John Coltrane playing the sax,” he says. “When I first called her she said, ‘I’m in AA. I had a serious drinking problem. I am a lapsed Catholic, but I still have strong ties to the church. So in order to do what you want I’m going to have to start drinking Jack Daniel’s again and smoking cigarettes and eating raw eggs.’ And she wanted to have her own two priests with her at all times.”Friedkin is chock-a-block with such tales. He says the first of his four wives, Jeanne Moreau, installed a lifelong love of Proust in him by reading it aloud. Happily married to Sherry Lansing for 26 years, Friedkin says, he wasn’t really “Hollywood’s most combustible director”, as the Telegraph once called him. “I don’t drink,” he says. “I’ve never done drugs. I’ve never tried grass. But I think Miles Davis is a reason to live.”He does cop to slapping a couple of people to get the sad and angry performances he wanted, noting that another word for director is “manipulator”.He did not want Gene Hackman to play the iconic New York police detective Popeye Doyle in The French Connection. He gave the role to Jimmy Breslin instead. “He had exactly the look I had in mind, a Black Irishman,” Friedkin says.“The first day he was great, great, great. The second day he forgot what he did on the first day. The third day he didn’t show up. Comes Friday he shows up and says, ‘Hey, isn’t there a car chase in this movie?’ I said, ‘Yeah.’ He said, ‘You know, I promised my mother on her deathbed I wouldn’t drive, so I don’t know how to drive.’ I said, ‘You’re fired.’ ”He gave Hackman the part, and they sparred so much during filming that at the end he told a producer: “I may get away with this thing, but if I had to do The Gene Hackman Story I wouldn’t hire this guy.” He acknowledges now that Hackman is one of the greatest American film actors.After lunch Friedkin makes me descend the Stairway to Hell, the 75 steps in the movie’s climactic scene that I had avoided my whole life. I saw The Exorcist on my 21st birthday and was so unnerved I went to bed and missed my own party.Standing on the steps, Friedkin channels the demon, growling, “Your mother still rots in hell, Karras, you faithless slime.” Tourists taking selfies on the stairs look around, startled. And even all these years later I still want to crawl under the covers. – New York TimesThank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

Dr Mainen, who worked on AI before moving into study of the human brain, argues that the root cause of human depression is an inability to update their beliefs about the world in the presence of new information. He thinks that this ability, in human brains, is modulated by the chemical serotonin. If you don’t have enough serotonin in your brain, you can’t change your understanding of things easily enough.The broad sweep of this is relatively familiar to people interested in how the brain works....To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeTo continue reading this article log in to your Telegraph account.

Initially, emergency rations included only rice, vegetable oil and lentils. Ms Leidman warned that the coming rainy season, which normally starts between April and June, could make the situation worse.She said some of the feeding centres were in areas that could flood and, although steps were being taken to prevent the worst effects of the flooding, it was unclear what impact the monsoon would have on vital services.The rainy season also presents a greater risk of waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea, typhoid, hepatitis, malaria and dengue.Ms Leidman added: “The possibility of an outbreak of infectious disease can exacerbate malnutrition.

a range of activities, from bribing officials, instigating riots and even \u0026quotinciting ethnic separatism\u0026quot.The website also allows people to give information relating to foreigners

unclear why the website is available in both English and Chinese, although the expat population in China is growing.Chinese president Xi Jinping, has strengthened security laws in ChinaA report by state news agency Xinhua said those who contact the website \u0026quotwill be rewarded if the information is true,\u0026quot although no details were given by authorities.Last April, officials in Beijing offered rewards of between 10,000 (£1,100) to 500,000 (£55,600) yuan for information on spies.Communist China takes an extremely strict approach to its national security and state media have previously reported on web users in the country being \u0026quotlured\u0026quot by foreign spies when looking for jobs and friends online.China established hotlines for people to inform on spies in

research flesh eating buruliulcer spreads","story":"A young boy shows his arm skin damaged by Buruli ulcer in Ivory CoastAustralia is facing a “rapidly worsening epidemic” of  gruesome flesh-eating ulcers that have baffled experts and prompted calls for urgent medical research to uncover the cause.Scientists said the Buruli ulcer, a bacterial infection which is most commonly seen in tropical parts of Africa, is being reported in increasing numbers in “temperate” rural areas in the state of Victoria. The number of annual cases has increased more than 400 per cent, with a record 182 cases reported in 216 and 236 in the first 11 months of 2017.“The community is facing a worsening epidemic, defined by cases rapidly increasing in number,  becoming more severe in nature, and occurring in new geographic areas,” said an article on the outbreak in the Medical Journal of Australia.The infection typically starts as a sore on the arm or leg that fails to heal and slowly enlarges, causing severe lesions of the skin and potentially requiring amputations. Sufferers often initially dismiss the initial symptoms as an insect bite.A severe ulcer on the knee of an 11-year-old boy, which took six months to heal\u0026quotIt can really become very severe and eats away at the skin and soft tissue … leading to, often, long-term cosmetic deformities, even mobility issues and occasionally it\u0027s actually associated with death,\u0026quot Professor Daniel O\u0027Brien, the article’s lead author and an infectious diseases expert, told ABC News.The outbreak has occurred in coastal areas in Victoria, including the Bellarine and Mornington peninsulas. But it has also reportedly spread to some suburbs in Melbourne, the country’s second-largest city. It is believed to be the only current outbreak in the developed world.Scientists have called for urgent funding to research the causes of the outbreak. The infection is believed to spread via mosquitoes and possums.\u0026quotWe actually don\u0027t know for sure — we have some clues about what may be the causes, but nobody really knows why it\u0027s located here, why it moves into new areas, and in fact how we catch it,\u0026quot Professor O’Brien said.Known as Mycobacterium ulcerans, the infection can often be treated with antibiotics, though  severe cases can require surgery or amputation.Possum and mosquitoes are believed to help spread the diseaseGus Charles, a 12-year-old, developed a lump on his knee after visiting the Mornington Peninsula for a family holiday.  Several doctors misdiagnosed it before a surgeon sliced into the lump and found a “huge pus-filled abscess”, according to a report in Fairfax Media.Gus eventually underwent plastic surgery and spent six months recovering. \u0026quotWhen I first saw it after surgery I fainted because it was pretty bad,\u0026quot he told ABC News.His mother, Sally, told Fairfax Media: “He complained about it a bit, but he’s a pretty tough kid. And then the lump started to get bigger and bigger.\u0026quotShe added: “It was horrible.

In BRE’s opinion … there would have been little opportunity for a fire in a flat of Grenfell Tower to spread to any neighbouring flats.” One of the flats in the Grenfell Tower which was destroyed by the fire The report details how the 2014-2016 refurbishment failed to meet several major fire safety standards set out in the building regulations. The window frames were too small for the hole meaning that rubberised membrane, rigid foam insulation and uPVC lightweight plastic panels were used to fill that gap and “none of the materials used would be capable of providing 30 minutes fire resistance”.Instead the materials provided a \u0026quotfuel\u0026quot which allowed the fire to spread to the facade, it is said. The cavity barriers, which were meant to close the gap between the concrete building and the external cladding in the event of a fire, were too small to do so and some were installed upside down or back to front. This created a chimney-like effect, it is said.  The insulation on the outside of the building was combustible and “provided a medium for fire spread up, across and within sections of the facade”, the BRE report found. Grenfell Tower fire in picturesFurthermore, the aluminium composite material used in the outside panels of the cladding had a polyethylene (plastic) core that “appears to be highly combustible” and “appears to have provided a medium for fire spread up and across the facade\u0026quot. Each breach relating to the cladding system is of far greater importance when “considered in combination as opposed to when they occur in isolation”, BRE notes. The report found that, contrary to building regulations, many of the doors did not have closers on them so as people fled their doors remained open allowing large quantities of fire and smoke to get into the communal areas. Firefighting facilities were also said to be deficient as there was only enough room for one engine to get close to the building. BRE also noted the absence of a sprinkler system and the fact that the tower\u0027s only stairwell was 8cm too narrow  but says that they did not contribute to the loss of life.It details how the fire started in a fridge freezer in flat 16 just one metre from an open window. It then could have either caught the materials around the window, the insulation or the combustible material in the cladding panels, or a combination of the three, experts say. This allowed the flames to enter the cavity between the concrete and the facade and the lack of cavity barriers created a chimney-like effect. As well as spreading upwards and laterally the fire spread downward fire spread because of \u0026quotburning droplets of polyethylene falling and igniting combustible materials below”.The faulty windows then allowed the fire to enter the other flats and the lack of door closers meant it could spread into the stairwell. The fire was so ferocious that had the original building not been built to such strict standards, it is likely it would have collapsed, the experts say. The BRE was asked to look at the fire by the Metropolitan Police to try and establish the circumstances surrounding as many of the 71 deaths as possible, and failings in duty of care to residents, and to provide expert witness support to any criminal prosecution of public inquiry. Top

He strikes me as a person of above average intelligence who’s tracking conversations and knows what’s going on. I don’t think he’s medically unfit to be president. I think he’s morally unfit to be president.\u0026quotA person who sees moral equivalence in Charlottesville, who talks about and treats women like they’re pieces of meat, who lies constantly about matters big and small and insists the American people believe it — that person’s not fit to be president of the United States, on moral grounds.\u0026quot \u0026quotPossibly. I mean, it\u0027s certainly some evidence of obstruction of justice. It would depend and-- and I\u0027m just a witness in this case, not the investigator or prosecutor, it would depend upon other things that reflected on his intent.\u0026quot Everything we know so far about James Comey\u0027s bombshell book\u0026quotI didn\u0027t ask about the business with the prostitutes, but he launched into an explanation as to how I should know that wasn\u0027t true and that he remembered now, from talking to friends who had been with him, that he\u0027d never stayed overnight at the hotel, he\u0027d just changed clothes there and went to the Miss Universe pageant.\u0026quotI don\u0027t know whether any of this true, but this is what he said. And then went right back without staying overnight. And then he said, \u0027Another reason you know it\u0027s not true is I\u0027m a germaphobe. There\u0027s no way I\u0027d let people pee on each other around me.\u0027 And that me caught me so much by surprise I actually let out an audible laugh and - \u0027cause it was just one of those - I was startled by it.\u0026quotAnd - and I remember thinking, \u0027ell, should I say that, \u0027As I understand the activity sir, it doesn\u0027t require an overnight stay. And given that it was allegedly the presidential suite at the Ritz Carlton, I would imagine you could be at a safe distance from the activity -\u0027 all these things are bouncing around my head. But instead of saying it, it just led me to think, \u0027The world\u0027s gone crazy.\u0027\u0026quotMr Comey was fired by Mr Trump in May last year\u0026quotI think it\u0027s possible. I don\u0027t know. These are more words I never thought I\u0027d utter about a president of the United States, but it\u0027s possible.\u0026quot \u0026quotI’m not trying to, by the way, suggest that President Trump is out breaking legs and — you know, shaking down shopkeepers. But instead, what I’m talking about is that leadership culture constantly comes back to me when I think about my experience with the Trump administration. The — the loyalty oaths, the boss as the dominant center of everything, it’s all about how do you serve the boss, what’s in the boss’s interests. It’s the family, the family, the family, the family. That’s why it reminds me so much and not, \u0027So what’s the right thing for the country and what are the values of the institutions that we’re dealing with?\u0027\u0026quot Rob Crilly: James Comey\u0027s cheap shots prove he was unfit to lead the FBI\u0026quotI say that in my book cause I’m trying to be honest, cause that’s the truth there had been all this controversy and mocking about hand size, I can’t remember the details. But as I shook his hand I made a note to check the size and it seemed like he had average-sized hands.\u0026quotA Higher Loyalty is published on Tuesday\u0026quotThat is the question that people have to ask themselves. And-- and there\u0027s no easy way to define it in the abstract, that you-- the challenge of this president is that he will stain everyone around him. And the question is, how much stain is too much stain and how much stain eventually makes you unable to accomplish your goal of protecting the country and serving the country? So I don\u0027t know. And it would be hard for anybody to answer that. But everyone\u0027s gotta answer that inidually.\u0026quotTop private school accused of sexism for advert showing boy aiming to be a lawyer and girl as an aspiring vocalistPrince Harry reveals Meghan Markle will take on Commonwealth roleAnt McPartlin pleads guilty to drink-driving after he was more than double legal limit in London crashNo truth, only power: How Russia\u0026#39s trolls and propagandists have turned Soviet disinformation into a terrifying art formGrenfell inferno would not have spread without faulty refurbishment, report finds China sets up English language website urging citizens to report on foreign spiesWatch: Buckingham Palace transformed by rainforest projectionInvestigation raises concerns over US budget airline that suffered five mid-air emergencies in a single dayLocal elections 2018: Polls, what to expect for the vote and key seats to watchThe Queen\u0026#39s Green Planet: the monarch\u0026#39s ambitious plan to turn the Commonwealth into a forestUK accuses Russia and Syria of blocking chemical inspectors from visiting DoumaDoctors call for urgent research as flesh-eating Buruli ulcer spreads in AustraliaUK weather: Britain to bask in 25C with Thursday set to be the hottest day of the year so farThe Moderate Soprano at Duke of York\u0026#39s, review – mild and flavourlessComment: Why can\u0026#39t James Comey accept that America put Donald Trump in power?Surfer mauled by shark swims to shore with leg injuriesGirl seen in hospital video of Syria \u0026#39chemical attack\u0026#39 speaks of ordealHarry Potter and the Cursed Child is the most expensive Broadway play ever stagedNorth Korea warns UK against ‘act of war’ after Royal Navy deployed to enforce sanctionsWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/14/TELEMMGLPICT000160123994_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqJKshGvN1om7Aqkp8aAKZGV206ZC705r5ZExmQGWsJ7I.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"uk accuses russia syria blocking chemical inspectors visiting","story":"The UK said inspectors must be allowed into the Douma siteBritain has accused Syria and Russian of preventing chemical weapons inspectors from reaching the site of the suspected gas attack in Douma which triggered Western strikes on the Assad regime. The British delegation to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said on Tuesday that inspectors were in Damascus but still unable to visit the site where more than 70 people were killed by a suspected regime chemical attack. “OPCW arrived in Damascus on Saturday. Russia \u0026amp Syria have not yet allowed access to Douma. Unfettered access essential. Russia \u0026amp Syria must cooperate,” the UK delegation said in a tweet. Peter Wilson, the UK ambassador, also urged the OPCW meeting \u0026quotto act to hold perpetrators to account\u0026quot, saying failure to do so \u0026quotwill only risk further barbaric use of chemical weapons, in Syria and beyond\u0026quot.Russia immediately denied the British allegations and said the OPCW visit to Douma had been delayed because of the Western airstrikes against the Syrian regime early Saturday morning.\u0026quotThis is the latest conjecture of our British colleagues,” said Sergei Ryabkov, Russia’s deputy foreign minister. The Russian embassy in the Netherlands, where the OPCW is based, said that Russia would not “interfere in its work”.   The Syrian regime also said it was “fully ready” to cooperate with the OPCW investigation. Faisal Mekdad, Syria\u0027s deputy foreign minister, said on Monday that government officials have met with the delegation, which has been in Damascus for three days, a number of times to discuss cooperation.Russian military police deployed to the site of the attack shortly after rebel fighters left the area. The US envoy to the OPCW said the military policemen may have tampered with the site of the April 7 incident incident in Douma, outside of Damascus.\u0026quotIt is long overdue that this council condemns the Syrian government for its reign of chemical terror and demands international accountability those responsible for these heinous acts,\u0026quot US Ambassador Kenneth Ward said in comments

country looks set to see the hottest day of the year so far.As the UK experiences its first taste of spring, just weeks after snow swept across many areas, the mercury could rise to up to 10C above the average for April, the Met Office has said.Meteorologist Alex Burkill said the weather will be \u0026quotturning warmer for a little time\u0026quot as hotter air is dragged up from the south, causing temperatures to rise as high as 25C (77F) by Thursday.With cloud and rain poised to affect Wales, northern and western England, Scotland and Northern Ireland over Monday night and into Tuesday, he warned it could be \u0026quotquite windy in the west\u0026quot.Sunrise at the harbour at Weymouth in Dorset Mr Burkill said the best of sunshine and warmth on Tuesday will be in the South East, where temperatures of 18C (64.4F) or 19C (66.2F) could be recorded.\u0026quotIt is not out of the question that we can get 20C (68F) tomorrow - which I believe would make it the warmest day of the year so far,\u0026quot he said.\u0026quotOn Wednesday it will be mostly dry and rather sunny for most places, but there will be some rain affecting Northern Ireland, Scotland and perhaps some parts of northern England too.\u0026quotBut for many central and eastern parts of the UK it is going to be a dry and very sunny day and, with that, temperatures creeping up as well.\u0026quotSunrise at Rockford Common in the New Forest near Ringwood, HampshireMr Burkhill said the rest of the week will also get warmer, and revealed that on Wednesday there could be highs of up to 22C (71.6F).\u0026quotThursday is probably going to be the warmest day - we could get highs of 24C (75.2F) or 25C (77F) (in the South East),\u0026quot he said.\u0026quotApart from a bit of showery rain across parts of Scotland perhaps, Thursday is looking like a dry and sunny day ... with temperatures quite widely getting above 20C (68F).\u0026quotWith average maximum temperatures for April across the UK around 11.5C (52.7F) and around 13C (55.4F) for southern England, Mr Burkill said it will be a \u0026quotgood 10C above average\u0026quot.Thursday\u0027s warm blast will see parts of the country be hotter than some European destinations, including Malaga in Spain at 21C (69.8F) and Athens in Greece at 23C (73.4F).Mr Burkill said it is \u0026quotnot especially\u0026quot unusual to see such temperatures, adding: \u0026quotQuite often we would have already gone above 20C by this time in the year.\u0026quotIt is quite normal for spring to be like this and to bring some colder spells and some temperatures like this.\u0026quotHe revealed that the warm and sunny weather looks set to continue into the weekend, but that it may be a little cooler, and said there could be some rain

Students are considering discontinuing due to\u0026nbspthe financial pressures’The education secretary has been urged to take immediate action after hundreds of student nurses had their loans and grants cut off or reduced due to administrative errors.Trade unions and professional bodies have called on Damian Hinds to “urgently intervene” to ensure the affected students at 20 universities receive the loans they had budgeted for next term.More than 800 students have been told they were paid too much money by the Student Loans Company (SLC), the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) has said – and they were told that upcoming payments were to be reduced or stopped to recover the sums. Loan error will leave student nurses unable to pay rent, union saysOverpayments of between £600 and £6,000 were made in error – and now some students are saying that a withdrawal of financial support could result in them dropping out of university.Last month, one nursing student, from the University of West London, said she was “worried sick” about being left without enough money to pay the rent, buy food and pay for travel to university.A new letter to the minister, coordinated by the RCN, says the union continues to receive a “huge volume of calls” from “worried and distressed students” due to the ongoing situation.It warns: “A sudden withdrawal of payments will have disastrous consequences for these students, who budget on a term-by-term basis according to loan and grant forecasts.“Many have families and children they will be unable to support if they do not receive additional income in the spring term.”The RCN – joined by Unison and the National Union of Students (NUS) – has called on the education secretary to “write off overpayments in the long term for these students.”The letter says: “We are writing to ask you to take urgent action to ensure healthcare students in England and Wales affected by errors made by the SLC will receive their anticipated payment of support in spring, as they had budgeted for.“We also ask that you use the power at your discretion as education secretary to write off overpayments in the long term for these students.”The letter warns: “Our student members are telling us that the risk of receiving a reduced payment, or no payment at all, will compromise their ability to continue studying.“In some cases, we are hearing concerning reports from inidual students who are considering discontinuing due to these financial pressures.”Student news in picturesStudent news in picturesSouth Korean policemen detain student protestors during a

In the words of a contemporary report, he argued that “in the coming century, the success of imperialism will depend largely upon success with the microscope”.Teenage vandals sentenced by judge to read history booksRoss, who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine for his malaria research, would later deny he was talking specifically about his own work. But his point neatly summarised how the efforts of British scientists was intertwined with their country’s attempt to conquer a quarter of the world.Ross was very much a child of empire, born in India and later working there as a surgeon in the imperial army. So when he used a microscope to identify how a dreaded tropical disease was transmitted, he would have realised that his discovery promised to safeguard the health of British troops and officials in the tropics. In turn, this would enable Britain to expand and consolidate its colonial rule.Ronald Ross at his lab in 1898 Calcutta (Welcome Collection)Ross’s words also suggest how science was used to argue imperialism was morally justified because it reflected British goodwill towards colonised people. It implied that scientific insights could be redeployed to promote superior health, hygiene and sanitation among colonial subjects. Empire was seen as a benevolent, selfless project. As Ross’s fellow Nobel laureate Rudyard Kipling described it, it was the “white man’s burden” to introduce modernity and civilised governance in the colonies.But science at this time was more than just a practical or ideological tool when it came to empire. Since its birth around the same time as Europeans began conquering other parts of the world, modern Western science was inextricably entangled with colonialism, especially British imperialism. And the legacy of that colonialism still pervades science today.As a result, recent years have seen an increasing number of calls to “decolonise science”, even going so far as to advocate scrapping the practice and findings of modern science altogether. Tackling the lingering influence of colonialism in science is much needed. But there are also dangers that the more extreme attempts to do so could play into the hands of religious fundamentalists and ultra-nationalists. We must find a way to remove the inequalities promoted by modern science while making sure its huge potential benefits work for everyone, instead of letting it become a tool for oppression.When a slave in an early 18th-century Jamaican plantation was found with a supposedly poisonous plant, his European overlords showed him no mercy. Suspected of conspiring to cause disorder on the plantation, he was treated with typical harshness and hanged to death. The historical records don’t even mention his name. His execution might also have been forgotten forever if it weren\u0027t for the scientific enquiry that followed. Europeans on the plantation became curious about the plant and, building on the slave’s “accidental finding”, they eventually concluded it wasn’t poisonous at all.Instead it became known as a cure for worms, warts, ringworm, freckles and cold swellings, with the name Apocynum erectum. As the historian Pratik Chakrabarti argues in a recent book, this incident serves as a neat example of how, under European political and commercial domination, gathering knowledge about nature could take place simultaneously with exploitation.For imperialists and their modern apologists, science and medicine were among the gracious gifts from the European empires to the colonial world. What’s more, the 19th-century imperial ideologues saw the scientific successes of the West as a way to allege that non-Europeans were intellectually inferior and so deserved and needed to be colonised.A racist caricature of European scientists visiting Africa. The severed head on the right is that of Ronald Ross (Welcome Collection)In the incredibly influential 1835 memo Minute on Indian Education, British politician Thomas Macaulay denounced Indian languages partially because they lacked scientific words. He suggested that languages such as Sanskrit and Arabic were “barren of useful knowledge”, “fruitful of monstrous superstitions” and contained “false history, false astronomy, false medicine”.Such opinions weren’t confined to colonial officials and imperial ideologues and were often shared by various representatives of the scientific profession. The prominent Victorian scientist Sir Francis Galton argued that the “the average intellectual standard of the negro race is some two grades below our own (the Anglo Saxon)”. Even Charles Darwin implied that “savage races” such as “the negro or the Australian” were closer to gorillas than were white Caucasians.Yet 19th-century British science was itself built upon a global repertoire of wisdom, information, and living and material specimens collected from various corners of the colonial world. Extracting raw materials from colonial mines and plantations went hand in hand with extracting scientific information and specimens from colonised people.Leading public scientific institutions in imperial Britain, such as the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew and the British Museum, as well as ethnographic displays of “exotic” humans, relied on a global network of colonial collectors and go-betweens. By 1857, the East India Company’s London zoological museum boasted insect specimens from across the colonial world, including from Ceylon, India, Java and Nepal.The scientists who used this evidence were rarely sedentary geniuses working in laboratories insulated from imperial politics and economics. The likes of Charles Darwin on the Beagle and botanist Sir Joseph Banks on the Endeavour literally rode on the voyages of British exploration and conquest that enabled imperialism.Sir Hans Sloane’s imperial collection started the British Museum (Paul HudsonWikipedia)Other scientific careers were directly driven by imperial achievements and needs. Early anthropological work in British India, such as Sir Herbert Hope Risley’s Tribes and Castes of Bengal, published in 1891, drew upon massive administrative classifications of the colonised population.Map-making operations including the work of the Great Trigonometrical Survey in South Asia came from the need to cross colonial landscapes for trade and military campaigns. The geological surveys commissioned around the world by Sir Roderick Murchison were linked with intelligence gathering on minerals and local politics.Efforts to curb epidemic diseases such as plague, smallpox and cholera led to attempts to discipline the routines, diets and movements of colonial subjects. This opened up a political process that the historian David Arnold has termed the “colonisation of the body”. By controlling people as well as countries, the authorities turned medicine into a weapon with which to secure imperial rule.New technologies were also put to use expanding and consolidating the empire. Photographs were used for creating physical and racial stereotypes of different groups of colonised people. Steamboats were crucial in the colonial exploration of Africa in the mid-19th century. Aircraft enabled the British to surveil and then bomb rebellions in 20th-century Iraq. The innovation of wireless radio in the 1890s was shaped by Britain’s need for discreet, long-distance communication during the South African war.In these ways and more, Europe’s leaps in science and technology during this period both drove and were driven by its political and economic domination of the rest of the world. Modern science was effectively built on a system that exploited millions of people. At the same time it helped justify and sustain that exploitation, in ways that hugely influenced how Europeans saw other races and countries. What’s more, colonial legacies continue to shape trends in science today.Imperialist Cecil Rhodes planned a railway and telegraph line to connect Africa (Alamy)Since the formal end of colonialism, we have become better at recognising how scientific expertise has come from many different countries and ethnicities. Yet former imperial nations still appear almost self-evidently superior to most of the once-colonised countries when it comes to scientific study. The empires may have virtually disappeared, but the cultural biases and disadvantages they imposed have not.How to fix all of your sleep problems with scienceYou just have to look at the statistics on the way research is carried out globally to see how the scientific hierarchy created by colonialism continues. The annual rankings of universities are published mostly by the Western world and tend to favour its own institutions. Academic journals across the different branches of science are mostly dominated by the US and Western Europe.It is unlikely that anyone who wishes to be taken seriously today would explain this data in terms of innate intellectual superiority determined by race. The blatant scientific racism of the 19th century has now given way to the notion that excellence in science and technology are a euphemism for significant funding, infrastructure and economic development.Because of this, most of Asia, Africa and the Caribbean is seen either as playing catch-up with the developed world or as dependent on its scientific expertise and financial aid. Some academics have identified these trends as evidence of the persisting “intellectual domination of the West” and labelled them a form of “neo-colonialism”.Not all international collaborations are equal (US Army AfricaFlickr)Various well-meaning efforts to bridge this gap have struggled to go beyond the legacies of colonialism. For example, scientific collaboration between countries can be a fruitful way of sharing skills and knowledge, and learning from the intellectual insights of one another. But when an economically weaker part of the world collaborates almost exclusively with very strong scientific partners, it can take the form of dependence, if not subordination.A 2009 study showed that about 80 per cent of Central Africa’s research papers were produced with collaborators based outside the region. With the exception of Rwanda, each of the African countries principally collaborated with its former coloniser. As a result, these dominant collaborators shaped scientific work in the region. They prioritised research on immediate local health-related issues, particularly infectious and tropical diseases, rather than encouraging local scientists to also pursue the fuller range of topics pursued in the West.In the same study, 60 per cent to 70 per cent of the scientists based in developed countries did not acknowledge their collaborators in poorer countries as co-authors in their papers. This is despite the fact they later claimed in the survey that the papers were the result of close collaborations.International health charities, which are dominated by Western countries, have faced similar issues. After the formal end of colonial rule, global health workers long appeared to represent a superior scientific culture in an alien environment. Unsurprisingly, interactions between these skilled and dedicated foreign personnel and the local population have often been characterised by mistrust.For example, during the smallpox eradication campaigns of the 1970s and the polio campaign of past two decades, the World Health Organization’s representatives found it quite challenging to mobilise willing participants and volunteers in the interiors of South Asia. On occasions they even saw resistance on religious grounds from local people. But their stringent responses, which included the close surveillance of villages, cash incentives for identifying concealed cases and house-to-house searches, added to this climate of mutual suspicion. These experiences of mistrust are reminiscent of those created by strict colonial policies of plague control.Polio eradication needs willing volunteers (Department for International DevelopmentFlickr)Western pharmaceutical firms also play a role by carrying out questionable clinical trials in the developing world where, as journalist Sonia Shah puts it, “ethical oversight is minimal and desperate patients abound”. This raises moral questions about whether multinational corporations misuse the economic weaknesses of once-colonised countries in the interests of scientific and medical research.The colonial image of science as a domain of the white man even continues to shape contemporary scientific practice in developed countries. People from ethnic minorities are underrepresented in science and engineering jobs and more likely to face discrimination and other barriers to career progress.To finally leave behind the baggage of colonialism, scientific collaborations need to become more symmetrical and founded on greater degrees of mutual respect. We need to decolonise science by recognising the true achievements and potential of scientists from outside the Western world. Yet while this structural change is necessary, the path to decolonisation has dangers of its own.In October 2016, a YouTube video of students discussing the decolonisation of science went surprisingly viral. The clip, which has been watched more than 1m times, shows a student from the University of Cape Town arguing that science as a whole should be scrapped and started again in a way that accommodates non-Western perspectives and experiences. The student’s point that science cannot explain so-called black magic earned the argument much derision and mockery. But you only have to look at the racist and ignorant comments left beneath the video to see why the topic is so in need of discussion.Inspired by the recent “Rhodes Must Fall” campaign against the university legacy of the imperialist Cecil Rhodes, the Cape Town students became associated with the phrase “science must fall”. While it may be interestingly provocative, this slogan isn’t helpful at a time when government policies in a range of countries including the US, UK and India are already threatening to impose major limits on science research funding.More alarmingly, the phrase also runs the risk of being used by religious fundamentalists and cynical politicians in their arguments against established scientific theories such as climate change. This is a time when the integrity of experts is under fire and science is the target of political manoeuvring. So polemically rejecting the subject altogether only plays into the hands of those who have no interest in decolonisation.Alongside its imperial history, science has also inspired many people in the former colonial world to demonstrate remarkable courage, critical thinking and dissent in the face of established beliefs and conservative traditions. These include the Indian anti-caste activist Rohith Vemula and the murdered atheist authors Narendra Dabholkar and Avijit Roy. Demanding that “science must fall” fails to do justice to this legacy.The call to decolonise science, as in the case of other disciplines such as literature, can encourage us to rethink the dominant image that scientific knowledge is the work of white men. But this much-needed critique of the scientific canon carries the other danger of inspiring alternative national narratives in post-colonial countries.A campaigner during a March for Science protest in Melbourne (Wikipedia Commons )For example, some Indian nationalists, including the country’s current prime minister, Narendra Modi, have emphasised the scientific glories of an ancient Hindu civilisation. They argue that plastic surgery, genetic science, aeroplanes and stem cell technology were in vogue in India thousands of years ago. These claims are not just a problem because they are factually inaccurate. Misusing science to stoke a sense of nationalist pride can easily feed into jingoism.Meanwhile, various forms of modern science and their potential benefits have been rejected as unpatriotic. In 2016, a senior Indian government official even went so far as to claim that “doctors prescribing non-Ayurvedic medicines are anti-national”.Attempts to decolonise science need to contest jingoistic claims of cultural superiority, whether they come from European imperial ideologues or the current representatives of post-colonial governments. This is where new trends in the history of science can be helpful.For example, instead of the parochial understanding of science as the work of lone geniuses, we could insist on a more cosmopolitan model. This would recognise how different networks of people have often worked together in scientific projects and the cultural exchanges that helped them – even if those exchanges were unequal and exploitative.But if scientists and historians are serious about “decolonising science” in this way, they need to do much more to present the culturally erse and global origins of science to a wider, non-specialist audience. For example, we need to make sure this decolonised story of the development of science makes its way into schools.Students should also be taught how empires affected the development of science and how scientific knowledge was reinforced, used and sometimes resisted by colonised people. We should encourage budding scientists to question whether science has done enough to dispel modern prejudices based on concepts of race, gender, class and nationality.Schools need to teach the non-Western history of science (Wikipedia Commons)Decolonising science will also involve encouraging Western institutions that hold imperial scientific collections to reflect more on the violent political contexts of war and colonisation in which these items were acquired. An obvious step forward would be to discuss repatriating scientific specimens to former colonies, as botanists working on plants originally from Angola but held primarily in Europe have done. If repatriation isn’t possible, then co-ownership or priority access for academics from post-colonial countries should at least be considered.This is also an opportunity for the broader scientific community to critically reflect on its own profession. Doing so will inspire scientists to think more about the political contexts that have kept their work going and about how changing them could benefit the scientific profession around the world. It should spark conversations between the sciences and other disciplines about their shared colonial past and how to address the issues it creates.Rohan Deb Roy is a lecturer in South Asian history at the University of Reading. theconversation.comor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In part this was for its symbolism, but it also meant he could be home with his family by Easter Day.Tony Blair and the Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern sign the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 (PA)Those who signed up called it the Good Friday Agreement those forced reluctantly to accept its terms still call it merely the Belfast Agreement. Its terms have come to be a guarantor of peace – or as near to it as Northern Ireland ever comes – for 20 years. Now is a curious time to threaten it.Yet the lessons of history are repeatedly forgotten, or disregarded by those who find them inconvenient for their present circumstances. In Blair’s more recent words, it is an “irresponsibility that is frankly sickening” that there are British politicians who would “sacrifice peace in Northern Ireland on the altar of Brexit”.His views are shared by his predecessor, the Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who engaged with and edged along the politically precarious process of engagement with the IRA. But opposition from his own party’s right wing meant only a Labour prime minister could carry it through to fruition.April 2018, with an uncertain Brexit hovering over the graveyards, is an apposite moment to recall the grim origins of the ‘peace process’, which lie in part in a particularly gory incident on the streets of Belfast that brought home to the British public the horror that most have since preferred to forget.It was shortly after noon on Friday 19 March 1988, two weeks before Good Friday. Father Alec Reid, a Catholic priest, was walking down Andersonstown Road when he heard angry shouts and animal-like screams mounting in murderous crescendo.Two British army corporals had apparently accidentally driven into the path of the funeral procession of an IRA member, himself killed by a loyalist gunman at a funeral three days earlier. Fearing a repeat attack, the crowd set upon the two soldiers, who were wearing civilian clothes, in their car. One of the soldiers drew his service pistol and fired in the air. They were dragged from the car.The men were overpowered, beaten and stripped. They were then shot dead on a patch of wasteland next to Andersonstown social club.Footage of the incident shocked the world. But with it came an image of compassion: a Catholic priest, grief etched on his face, ministering to one of the British soldiers in death. Few who looked upon that scene were aware that a regular visitor to Reid’s confessional was a former barman named Gerry Adams.Father Alec Reid giving last rites to one of the two soldiers killed by a mob at the funeral of an IRA member shot by loyalist gunman Michael Stone (Rex)Indeed, Reid was already by this time acting as a go-between for Adams, the leader of the IRA, and John Hume, head of the moderate nationalist SDLP. The incident on the Andersonstown Road strengthened his determination to bring about an alliance between the two men. Staggeringly, it emerged years later that he was carrying a message from Adams to Hume on the day of the killings.  The IRA were understandably toxic to British politicians. The aim was to bring them in from the cold. Hume was a republican but respectable. The theory was that he might be able to convey to London what it would take to make the IRA call off their campaign of violence.The most difficult issue was the IRA’s total refusal to recognise an inner-Ireland border guarded by soldiers and armed police. (Sound familiar?)I understood all this. I had grown up in Northern Ireland had lost two schoolfriends to the IRA. I was also aware of what had led to the violence: my Protestant grandfather had been a landlord who had three votes in local elections, while his Catholic tenants had none.Talking to Adams represented a political risk for Hume. Reid orchestrated secret meetings at Clonard Monastery on the ‘peace line’ in Belfast, where the 20ft-high wall had a statue of the Virgin Mary on one side and a ‘No Surrender’ mural on the other.The IRA top command had started to realise they might not convince the British government to ‘sell out’ the wishes of nearly one million citizens in Northern Ireland at the barrel of a gun. The slogan ‘Armalite in one hand and ballot box in the other’, coined by Danny Morrison in 1981, was being called into question.On the other hand, Peter Brooke, British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland between 1989 and 1992, admitted military defeat of the IRA was ‘difficult to envisage’.Still, many at the top of the IRA now believed London’s insistence – communicated publicly by Brooke – that it laid no claim to the six counties other than respecting the wishes of a majority of its people.Peter Brooke played an important role as Northern Ireland secretary (Reuters)Reid was also in regular contact with Irish taoiseach Charles Haughey. Brooke, meanwhile, set up shop in Stormont and held regular talks with Dublin politicians. Soon after taking up his post he had been briefed on the existence of a back channel between Michael Oatley, an MI6 agent, codenamed ‘Mountain Climber’, and the IRA’s hard man Martin McGuinness he authorised it to be continued.The word ‘clarification’ bounced back and forth in the game of semantics versus reality, the perpetual hallmark of Anglo-Irish relations. There were regular calls between Dublin wordsmith Martin Mansergh and Northern Ireland Office man John Chilcot (later to become known for overseeing the inquiry into the Iraq War) in an attempt to find common ground.Palace coups played their part in bringing matters to a head. First, Margaret Thatcher was ousted by her party, then Haughey by his. The ‘Iron Lady’ and ‘The Boss’ were gone. In their places were the less intimidating and more amenable John Major and Albert Reynolds.Ex-PM John Major tears into May’s ‘grand folly’ Brexit strategyIn February 1993 Major was looking over papers in the Cabinet Room when he was informed that there was a phone call for him from the IRA, possibly McGuinness himself. “The conflict is over, but we need your advice on how to bring it to a close.” Major decided to take the call seriously.A bomb in Warrington a few weeks later, which killed two children, nearly destroyed everything, until the IRA, chastened by their own wives and mothers, confidentially apologised: they had uncontrollable hardliners too. Indeed, in October, a bungled attack on a loyalist paramilitary office above a chip shop killed nine. A retaliation Halloween attack on a Catholic pub killed eight.But the forces of reason still rang out loud. By December, Major and Reynolds agreed what became known as the Downing Street Declaration, containing most of the points that would later be embodied in the Good Friday Agreement. The response was hesitant, but in August 1994 the IRA declared a ‘cessation of hostilities’.It seemed Major’s gamble had paid off, even if at a rally outside Belfast City Hall in August 1995 Gerry Adams was cheered when he declared: “They haven’t gone away, you know.”John Hume with Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness during talksIn November, US President Bill Clinton addressed another Belfast rally and announced Senator George Mitchell as his ‘special envoy’ to the peace talks.Mitchell declared his strategy to be a twin track of talks and moves towards arms decommissioning. The two main unionist parties, the UUP and the more hardline DUP, refused to attend negotiations. Sinn Fein were refused entry. The political wings of unionist paramilitaries, however, were allowed in.In late 1997 I sat with David Ervine, a former UVF man jailed for possession of explosives, now a member of their political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, in a north Belfast bar. Guinness dripped from his moustache as he shared his changed views:“Pope John Paul II is a nice old Polish bloke it doesn’t do anybody any good going around shouting he is the antichrist.“If you want to make peace with men with guns,” he went on, “you have to talk to those who represent the men with guns.”The British government had initially done that with one side but not the other. As a result, the IRA ceasefire ended abruptly on 9 February 1996 when a bomb in London’s Canary Wharf financial district killed two and wounded more than 100.Allegations of foot-dragging were exchanged by both sides. In June, elections were held for a Northern Ireland Forum. Sinn Fein won 17 of 110 seats but refused to take up membership of what it considered a puppet British institution.The IRA caused huge damage in the Docklands bombing of 1996 (Reuters)Sure enough, the day after the Forum’s first meeting, the IRA gave its clear verdict: a 1,500 kilo bomb (the biggest in Britain since the end of World War Two) wiped out a large portion of Manchester city centre. A 90-minute warning saw 75,000 people evacuated from the area, and while there were no fatalities hundreds were injured.Again, though, a change of government put talks back on track. In May 1997 John Major handed the keys of 10 Downing Street to Tony Blair, a Labour leader who didn’t have to cope with the hard right wingers Major himself called “bastards”.Blair’s new Northern Ireland minister Mo Mowlam issued the long-awaited invitation to Sinn Fein to join the talks. In July, the IRA announced a renewed ceasefire.Cameron was right to ‘tell the truth’ on Bloody Sunday: Introducing anCrucially, in January 1998 Blair announced a fresh public inquiry into the 1972 Bloody Sunday killings in Derry, in which 14 unarmed citizens were shot dead by British troops. Its conclusions, finally revealed in 2010, exonerated Martin McGuinness from involvement and blamed British paratroopers for firing first.Compromises paid off. A legally binding agreement, involving both British and Irish governments and echoing the 1993 Downing Street Declaration, was at last on the cards. The wording was designed to be a classic agreement to differ, to promise everything to everyone.The key elements were a mutual renunciation of violation, and assurances that Northern Ireland would remain part of the UK as long as a majority of its citizens wanted it to – but could in principle become part of the Irish Republic if a majority desired it in the future.The provisions were put to referendums on both sides of the border. In the Republic, more than 94 per cent of a 56 per cent turnout voted ‘yes’, in the north 71 per cent voted ‘yes’ on a turnout of 81 per cent. There was no official breakdown of the ethnic pattern in the north independent observers reckoned it was overwhelming in republican circles but marginal among unionist voters.Of Northern Ireland’s nine political parties, eight signed up to the agreement. Only one, the DUP, refused (a fact Theresa May might have missed in 2017 when she welcomed the party as an ally to prop up her minority government).Ireland amended its constitution to remove the claim that the territory of the state was the ‘whole island’. In return Britain repealed the symbolic but obsolete 1920 Government of Ireland Act, which still nominally implied similar territorial claims.Ian Paisley, left, and Martin McGuinness developed a surprisingly close relationship when they led the Northern Ireland Assembly (Getty)The European Union ploughed money into north-south Irish infrastructure, including a motorway from Dublin to Belfast. The single market and customs union meant border posts disappeared, and so did the armed men who guarded them.The early days were difficult. The old ‘moderate parties’ – the UUP and SDLP – initially dominated the new Northern Ireland Assembly, including by taking up the roles of first and deputy first minister. But after arguments broke out in 2001, the assembly was ultimately suspended by Westminster and Northern Ireland reverted to direct rule from London until a new agreement and the Assembly’s restoration in 2007.This time, as David Ervine had predicted, the real power brokers were to be found in the driving seat: the DUP veteran firebrand Ian Paisley and ex-IRA man Martin McGuinness.Against all odds, they not only agreed to work together but found points in common to the extent that they became something like friends, nicknamed ‘the Chuckle Brothers’. It was everything and more than the script writers of the Good Friday Agreement had dared dream of.Decommissioning of weapons, overseen by two American politicians and two generals, one Canadian, one Finnish, went on until 2005, by which time the international committee reckoned the IRA had done away with an armoury that included some 1,000 rifles, three tonnes of Semtex, and 20-30 heavy machine guns.Irish border joins orce bill on pile of reasons for Brexit deadlockIn the current Brexit context it is interesting to consider how British membership of the Euro currency – to which Ireland of course signed up – would have meant an even less obvious border between north and south.It wasn’t to happen though: British politicians treated the issue as done and dusted, and forgot the price.There is a belief among some Ulster Unionists – just as there is among many Brexiteers – that any risk is worth taking, any outcome acceptable, as long as it achieves the sole important aim: in the former case staying in a union in the latter, getting out of one.Kate Hoey, the pro-foxhunting Labour MP who has more in common with the DUP than her own party, is one of those who straddles both those camps. The Antrim-born Brexit supporter has said she would “do anything” to ensure Northern Ireland remains an integral part of the UK. She also caused outrage by suggesting that if Brexit did mean a hard border in Ireland, then it would have to be the EU – and thus the Irish – who would pay for it (on the basis that the British have no desire to erect one).Hoey and others like her give the strong impression of being dyed-in-the wool members of what was once the ‘protestant ascendancy’ who, like their forefathers, see British rule as a guarantee of superiority on their home turf.Michel Barnier says a solution must be found to avoid a hard border in Northern IrelandThe Good Friday Agreement questioned that assumption Northern Ireland’s demographic shift in the years since is moving it towards breaking point. Unionist parties lost their outright majority at Stormont in Assembly elections just over a year ago. How long will it be till a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would prefer to see their future as part of Ireland, not the UK?  Set against this backdrop, Brexit looked to many unionists like locking a fire safety door.That classic guide to British history up to 1918, Sellar’s and Yeatman’s ‘1066 and all that’, declared: “Gladstone tried all his life to guess the answer to the Irish question. Unfortunately, whenever he was getting warm, the Irish secretly changed the question.”This time it is the British who have changed the question.And nobody knows the answer.The Northern Ireland we know today was born in 1920 as part of a solution to long-running Irish ‘home rule’ demands, by creating two separate jurisdictions on the island, both still within the UK.It was a selective gerrymandering designed to perpetuate the rights of a pro-British, mainly Protestant ‘ascendancy’ within six of the nine counties of the historical province of Ulster, while giving discrete home rule to the south.It was not just too little too late, but way past its sell-by date. The scheme had been thrown into chaos by the First World War, the 1916 Easter Rising and its bloody suppression, then Sinn Fein’s 1918 landslide election and declaration of independence.The status of the ‘six counties’ was a major factor in the ensuing civil war over the new country’s status. But the deal survived and an imposing neo-classical parliament building was erected at Stormont on the outskirts of Belfast.Within their new Northern Irish fiefdom, with its built-in two-thirds majority rights, the Protestant-dominated government for the next 40 years oversaw a regime which frequently discriminated against the pro-Irish, largely Catholic minority. Prejudice was evident in housing, employment and voting rights, among other areas.The status quo was maintained by an almost exclusively Protestant armed police force that gloried in its ‘Royal’ Ulster Constabulary title and had a paramilitary wing known as the ‘B-Specials’, used against street riots in the 1930s and in the suppression of an IRA campaign in the 1950s.After renewed civil rights marches in the late 1960s led to further riots, brutally put down, regular British troops were sent to Northern Ireland and the ‘Specials’ were disbanded.A split within the IRA in 1969 had created the more militant ‘Provisional’ wing, which began a violent campaign both in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain. Stormont’s response was internment without trial and a declaration that it was “at war”.In January 1972 British soldiers shot dead 13 people in (London)Derry, which would become known as Bloody Sunday. In response the British embassy in Dublin was burnt down. Two months later direct rule from London was imposed on Northern Ireland.Father Edward Daly (who became Bishop of Derry) leads casualties to safety on Bloody Sunday (Belfast Telegraph)Unionists at first considered this a blow but came to realise direct rule actually reinforced the province’s British status. The IRA stepped up its campaign, leading to a virtual civil war, with British troops considered to be on the side of the unionists.The death toll on both sides of the Irish Sea soared into thousands, with no end in sight. It was against that background that forces of sanity plucked the Good Friday Agreement seemingly from nowhere, persuading both sides that this was the only way to ensure peace and security for the foreseeable future.But the foreseeable future is hostage to demographics. In the 2017 elections, after the polarising Brexit vote, the combined unionist lobby lost their majority for the first time. The hardline DUP lost 10 seats, talking a total of 28, just one more than Sinn Fein.The Good Friday Agreement’s promise to both sides that Northern Ireland’s future would be determined by the wishes of the majority may eventually point towards a vote for Irish unity.As things stand, few would see the point of posing such a potentially explosive question. But Brexit and the possibility of a ‘hard border’ between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic could put all sorts of options back on the table.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 20,000 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpathsYet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidationCertainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.At a picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up, the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers. Stag membership doubled within the month.“At that point people were really realising this isn’t just about trees, it’s about democracy and our right to a say on what happens in our streets,” says Teal, a psychologist by trade.Demonstrations became feistier. Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesAneira Thomas, the first baby to be born on the NHS, addresses the Unison Health Conference at the Brighton CentreSir Patrick Stewart addresses the crowd during the People\u0027s Vote campaign launch on Brexit at the Electric Ballroom in Camden Town.

None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

If the election were held today, frankly, I think Republicans would lose both,” the conservative pollster said on Fox News.Republican governor warns party is at risk of Democratic gainsRepublican finally concedes special election in ominous sign for TrumpHillary Clinton says \u0027the Russians are coming\u0027 ahead of midtermsRepublicans fear a \u0027bloodbath\u0027 in midterm electionsAmerica’s best known public opinion guru partially heaped blame on Mr Trump for the Republican Party\u0027s dwindling electoral hopes.“If Donald Trump wants to keep the Republican Congress, he has to differentiate when he’s attacking Congress in general versus the Republicans in Congress,” he said.“Differentiate when he’s attacking the press versus when he feels he’s not getting a fair shake”.Mr Luntz argued the economy had flourished under the Trump administration but that the president failed to gain proper recognition for it. He suggested the leader’s obsession with tweeting deflected attention away from positive stories about the economy.A slew of polls in recent weeks have shown Democrats with a lead over Republicans. A Quinnipiac University poll released last month showed Democrats holding a 10-point lead.In the House, 435 seats are up for election in the forthcoming midterms. The Republicans in that chamber currently hold 238 seats and the Democrats have 192 but are predicted to procure more. The Democrats need to flip 23 seats in order to take back the House.But the Senate is a far trickier political landscape - 35 seats are up in the 2018 elections there. The Democrats need to defend their existing 26 of those seats and win two extras in order to take control of the chamber. Donald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesDonald Trump\u0027s first year: in picturesUS President Donald Trump acknowledges the audience after taking the oath of office as his wife Melania (L) and daughter Tiffany watch during inauguration ceremonies swearing in Trump as the 45th president of the United States on the West Front of the US capital in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jim Bourg: This photo was shot with one of two remote cameras. The cameras were monitored and triggered remotely and the pictures were transmitted to clients worldwide within minutes of being taken.US President Barack Obama wipes away tears as he delivers his farewell address in Chicago on 10 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: In his final days in office, Obama made a visit home to Chicago. As he spoke from the stage to his wife and daughter in the audience, he became emotional when he talked about what they had sacrificed during his time in office. I turned from photographing the Obama women embracing to find him onstage wiping away tears. A combination of photos shows the crowds attending the inauguration ceremonies to swear in U.S. President Donald Trump at 12:01pm (left) on January 20, 2017 and President Barack Obama sometime between 12:07pm and 12:26pm on January 20, 2009. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump attend the Liberty Ball in honour of his inauguration in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: What I see when I look at this picture is the end of a very long day, not to mention weeks and months of preparation by many photographers, editors and network experts and the beginning of everything since. US President Donald Trump greets Director of the FBI James Comey as Director of the Secret Service Joseph Clancy (L), watches during the Inaugural Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders Reception in the Blue Room of the White House on 22 January, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: I have covered the White House for 16 years and normally either the President or the pool is in position when an event starts. In this case the President was not where anyone expected him to be. In fact, he was almost blocking the door when the pool came in. We had to scramble to find a position without bumping him or the furniture as he greeted and thanked members of law enforcement for their security efforts during the inauguration. Luckily, he greeted FBI Director James Comey a few seconds after the pool had made its way into the room.US President Donald Trump, is joined by his staff, as he speaks by phone with Russia\u0027s President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office on 28 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Very early in the Trump administration, weekends were as busy as weekdays. On Trump\u0027s second Saturday the official schedule said he would be making private phone calls to a number of world leaders including Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin. I arrived early and, before sitting down at my desk walked up to Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u0027s office. He, too, was just taking his coat off. I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn\u0027t even think about it twice. We\u0027ll do it! he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on.Senior advisor Kellyanne Conway (L) attends as US President Donald Trump welcomes the leaders of dozens of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the Oval Office on 27 February, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: We\u0027re often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone. Germany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Donald Trump hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House on 17 March, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Chancellor Merkel made one of the earliest important visits of any US allies to meet Trump in his first months in office. When world leaders give joint news conferences they don\u0027t always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt.President Trump reacts as he sits on a truck while he welcomes truckers and CEOs to attend a meeting regarding healthcare at the White House on 23 March, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO\u0027s of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver\u0027s seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected.US President Donald Trump talks to journalists members of the travel pool on board the Air Force One during his trip to Palm Beach, Florida on 6 April, 2017. Carlos Barria: During the many trips to President Trump\u0027s residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called \u0027Winter White House\u0027, Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader.US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. \u0026#13US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to celebrate his hundred days in office with a victory rally. He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections. As usual when the commander-in-chief arrives local residents gather to greet him. This time a small group of military personnel attended the arrival. Surrounded by secret service agents Trump walked from the Air Force One and raised his hand in a sign of victory as the crowd cheered him on.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer (L) and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus watch as US President Donald Trump presents the U.S. Air Force Academy football team with the Commander-in-Chief trophy in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington on 2 May, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold.Secret Service agents use a presidential limousine as cover from spraying water as US President Donald Trump lands via Marine One helicopter in New York on 4 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning. Here, Secret Service agents protect themselves from the spray from the East River as Trump lands on the helipad. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump wait the arrival of French President Emmanuel Macron (unseen) before a lunch ahead of a NATO Summit in Brussels on 25 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: One of the best parts of travelling overseas for White House coverage is the chance to see the U.S. president in different environments and (literally) a different light. Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France\u0027s President Macron.US President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on 7 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump\u0027s first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world\u0027s eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump\u0027s hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot. First lady Melania Trump chats with US President Donald Trump during their return from Germany at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland on 8 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: After President Trump\u0027s trip to Germany he arrived back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. First Lady Melania Trump said goodbye to Trump as she was heading off in a different direction that day. While chatting a breeze blew Melania\u0027s hair up in the air. Vice President Mike Pence laughs as President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House on 17 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: This summer the White House organized an event to showcase \u0027Made in America\u0027 products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It\u0027s crucial to know who\u0027s who and why they\u0027re important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it\u0027s like to be a West Wing staffer on the road. US President Donald Trump arrives at a rally in West Virginia on 3 August, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked. Without his protective glasses on, US President Donald Trump looks up towards the solar eclipse while viewing with his wife Melania and son Barron at the White House on 21 August, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: On a day when everyone, and I mean everyone, was told not to look at the eclipse without protective glasses, Trump, President of the United States, couldn\u0027t help himself.US President Donald Trump poses for a photo as he and first lady Melania Trump help volunteers hand out meals during a visit with flood survivors of Hurricane Harvey at a relief centre in Houston, Texas on 2 September, 2017. Photohrapher Kevin Lamarque: Trump, eager to deliver the image of a hands-on response to Hurricane Harvey, made this visit to a relief centre and obliged this woman with a selfie as Melania continued to work. Donald Trump welcomes 11-year-old Frank Giaccio as he cuts the Rose Garden grass at the White House on 15 September. Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today\u0027s politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice. President Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 3 October, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls.White House Senior adviser Jared Kushner sits behind President Trump during a cabinet meeting in Washington on 1 November, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure.Donald Trump and China\u0027s President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: It\u0027s one of those how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row. If I\u0027m not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump\u0027s recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven\u0027t seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn\u0027t work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples\u0027 attention.Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia\u0027s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam\u0027s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia\u0027s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional ASEAN handshake as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments.Democrats believe that with Mr Trump’s approval at a record low and with a similarly record number of candidates from its party getting ready to run in November, they will be able to capitalise on anti-Trump sentiment and retake one or both chambers of Congress. Former vice president Joe Biden recently argued Democrats would win back the House and maybe even the Senate in Autumn.“We’re going to win back the House. We actually have a chance at winning back the Senate, for real. It’s a little more of a climb, but it’s real,” Mr Biden said in February.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One of the reasons for his decision, according to reports, was the frustration he has working with Donald Trump.“I think we have achieved a heck of a lot. You all know that I did not seek this job. I took it reluctantly,” Mr Ryan said at a press conference in Washington. “But I gave it everything I could ... I have no regrets.”News of the the departure of Mr Ryan, who will serve out his term and retire in January, was first reported by Axios. “House Republicans were already in very tough spot for midterms, with many endangered members and the good chance that Democrats will win the majority,” the website said.“Friends say that after Ryan passed tax reform, his longtime dream, he was ready to step out of a job that has become endlessly frustrating, in part because of President Trump.”World news in picturesWorld news in picturesFireworks are set off as the final performance takes place during the Closing Ceremony for the 2018 Commonwealth Games.The wreckage of the Scientific Studies and Research Centre compound in the Barzeh district, north of Damascus, after the United States, UK and France launched strikes against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u0027s regime early on April 14 in response to an alleged chemical weapons attack after mulling military action for nearly a week.

He took the job, with some anxieties, and with a reputation as a straight but rather uncharismatic policy wonk.Mr Ryan denied that he was resigning because of concerns about the plight of the Republicans. He also dismissed a suggestion it was because he found it difficult to work with Mr Trump.“I’m grateful for the opportunity he has given us to do big things,” he said, adding how proud he had been to help pass last year’s tax cut, the biggest since 1986.It is possible that Mr Ryan, who did not run for the presidency as part of a huge Republican field in 2016, could yet return to the political fray. Paul Ryan on Pennsylvania’s special congressional race: Both candidates ran as ConservativesMr Ryan, who said he was inspired to enter public service after reading the words of the late Russian-American novelist and philosopher Ayn Rand, has long harboured ambitions about the White House, and reports suggested he could yet make another run. It is possible he could decide to be mainstream Republican primary challenger to President Trump if the billionaire decides to seek re-election in 2020, something he has indicated  he plans to do.Reports said Mr Ryan may have thought twice to publicise any planned departure, because it could hurt his fundraising capacity on behalf of fellow Republicans and undercut his ability to make deals in the House of Representatives. Yet he said he would continue to hold the position of Speaker and then stand down in January. To run for re-election in November, and then resign two months later, would be acting in an honest way to the people he represented, he said.“I really do not believe whether I stay or go will affect how a person running for congress does,” he said. “If we do our jobs, as we are, we’re going to have a great record to run on.” Mr Ryan said he had spent 20 years in congress, and that if he were to stay for one more term, his children would only know him as a weekend dad. “I can’t let that happen.”  Faith leaders arrested at DACA protest outside Paul Ryan’s office Paul Ryan suggests he has enough votes to prevent government shutdownUS Speaker Paul Ryan calls for a ‘cleanse’ of the FBIMore than three dozen House Republicans have announced that they are retiring, running for another office, or resigning. Democrats need to win 24 seats in the November elections to retake a majority in the House, which Republicans have controlled since 2011.Mr Ryan has made little effort to hide his disdain for Mr Trump, his style as a politician or his rhetoric. After an Access Hollywood video was released shortly before the election in 2016, in which Mr Trump was recorded apparently bragging about sexually assaulting women, Mr Ryan condemned the candidate’s comments.“I am sickened by what I heard today. Women are to be championed and revered, not objectified,” he said. “I hope Mr Trump treats this situation with the seriousness it deserves, and works to demonstrate that he has greater respect for women than the clip suggests.”It subsequently emerged that the Speaker had been even more outspoken privately. An audio recording published in March 2017, two months after President Trump had entered the White House, revealed Mr Ryan telling House Republicans at the time of the Access Hollywood’s release that he would “no longer defend” the New York billionaire.“I am not going to defend Donald Trump – not now, not in the future,” he said. “To everyone on this call, this is going to be a turbulent month. Many of you on this call are facing tough re-elections. “Some of you are not. But with respect to Donald Trump, I would encourage you to do what you think is best and do what you feel you need to do. Personally, you need to decide what’s best for you.”As it was, Mr Ryan appeared to mend fences with Mr Trump, or at least pretended to, and campaigned for him in his home state of Wisconsin – a state that the brash former reality television star was able to capture by less than 23,000 votes, and which was crucial to him entering the White House.“This is the most incredible political feat I have seen in my lifetime,” Mr Ryan said after Mr Trump had won.“Donald Trump heard a voice out in this country that no one else heard. He connected in ways with people no else did. He turned politics on its head.”Mr Trump praised Mr Ryan after the announcement. Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question, he said.

Bangladesh has given Myanmar a list of more than 8,000 refugees to begin the repatriation, but the return has been delayed by a complicated verification process. The two countries agreed in December to begin repatriating the refugees in January, but there were concerns among aid workers and Rohingya that they would be forced to return and face unsafe conditions in Myanmar. Hundreds of Rohingya were reportedly killed in the recent violence, and many houses and villages burnt to the ground. The United Nations and the US have described the army crackdown as “ethnic cleansing”. On Friday, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) and Bangladesh finalised a memorandum of understanding that describes the repatriation process as “safe, voluntary and dignified ... in line with international standards”. Photos ‘show dozens of burned Muslim villages being bulldozed’The UNHCR said it considers that “conditions in Myanmar are not yet conducive for returns to be safe, dignified and sustainable. The responsibility for creating such conditions remains with the Myanmar authorities, and these must go beyond the preparation of physical infrastructure to facilitate logistical arrangements.” Earlier in the week, Myanmar social welfare minister Win Myat Aye met with about 40 Rohingya refugees at the Kutupalong camp in Cox’s Bazar in Bangladesh for more than an hour, sometimes exchanging heated words. A Rohingya leader, Abdur Rahim, said at least eight rape victims were among the group.Mr Rahim said the group presented 13 demands for the government to meet for their return to Myanmar. Rohingya refugees – in picturesRohingya refugees – in picturesA young girl and a baby wade through mud after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh from Burma on 10 SeptemberRohingya refugees walk through a camp in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh after arriving from BurmaA young Rohingya refugee gathers firewood after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh from BurmaRohingya refugees wait for sacks of rice to be distributed in Whaikhyang, BangladeshRohingya Muslim refugees arrive on a boat in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh after crossing from Burma on 8 SeptemberRohingya Muslim refugees react after being re-united with each other after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh on a boat from BurmaRohingya Muslim refugees walk along the remains of a road after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh on a boat from BurmaRohingya Muslim refugees wade through water after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh by boat from BurmaRohingya Muslim refugees wade through water after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh by boat from Myanmar Rohingya Muslim refugees stand in the rain after arriving in Whaikhyang, Bangladesh by boat from BurmaIndian children hold placards and shout slogans during a protest against the alleged persecution of the Rohingya Muslims in BurmaSupporters of the Difa-e-Pakistan Council (DPC), an Islamic organisation, listen to their leaders\u0027 speeches against Burma\u0027s persecution of Rohingya Muslims, during a demonstration in KarachiHundreds of Iranians take part in a protest against violence in Myanmar after weekly Friday prayers, in TehranIndonesian Muslim activists hold placards and shout slogans during a protest against the alleged persecution of the Rohingya minority in Magelang, Central Java, IndonesiaMembers of an Islamic organisation shout slogans against the Burma government during a protest in Dhaka, BangladeshThe refugees apparently became angry when told they must accept national verification cards provided by Myanmar that state they are migrants from Bangladesh. Rohingya Muslims have long been treated as outsiders in Myanmar, even though their families have lived in the country for generations. Nearly all have been denied citizenship since 1982, effectively rendering them stateless. They are denied freedom of movement and other basic rights. Mr Rahim said they demanded to be recognised as citizens of Myanmar before the repatriation starts and that their security arrangements be supervised by the UN. Rohingya who have been repatriated in the past after previous refugee exoduses have been forced to live in camps in Myanmar. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?
