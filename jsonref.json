What about for three days? Or every day for a two-week period?In a world before shutdowns and social distancing, could you set out the detail of your daily life every workplace meeting, each gym session, every date and social event? Who did you meet and for how long?And could you confidently give that information to a stranger if it meant protecting the health of people you care about and the community at large?Welcome to the world of contact tracing. It’s a term many Australians would have scarcely been familiar with even a month ago. But it’s one of the key techniques in communicable disease control, used by health authorities to monitor and slow the spread of an infection in the community.In Australia, contact tracing is typically used to monitor the transmission of illnesses such as the measles. It is now at the forefront of the national response to the coronavirus crisis.Across the country, teams of doctors, nurses and public health officers talk to Covid-19 patients to help them retrace their movements. They’re building a picture that they hope will locate the original source of the patient’s infection as well as any people they might have exposed to the disease.In doing so, they hope to interrupt the transmission of Covid-19 in the community.“I’ve been doing this job for a long, long time and you do need to have a skillset,” says Sue Reid, a public health nurse with the ACT’s health protection service. “Detective is one of the terms I use.“By and large, most people are very cooperative. They know we are trying to help them and others out there.”The profile of contact tracers and the work they do has risen as a result of the global coronavirus pandemic.Countries that have had more success in flattening the infection curve, such as South Korea, have used a combination of widespread testing, contact tracing and isolation to slow the spread of Covid-19.This week, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, said stronger contact tracing was one of three conditions that would need to be met before Australia’s current social distancing restrictions could be eased.Improved contact tracing would likely include the use of an app that will trace every person who has been in contact with a mobile phone owner who has tested positive for coronavirus in the previous few weeks.Such technology is fraught with privacy issues and there is not yet enough information on how an Australian app would work to say what the implications will be.For now, the work of contact tracing is conducted by teams working within state public health units.Nicknamed “disease detectives”, these teams can consist of case investigators, contact tracers and case liaison officers, each with clear roles and responsibilities once a case of Covid-19 is confirmed.The professional backgrounds of these teams are erse, ranging from medicine and nursing to medical science, epidemiology and environmental health. They work not just in conjunction with public hospitals, but also GPs, private hospitals and other health facilities patients might have come into contact with.Since the arrival of Covid-19, their ranks have swelled to manage the increase in workload. In Brisbane’s metro south public health unit, which serves a population of about 1.2 million south of the Brisbane river, the team doing this work has grown to 100 people, triple its size before the pandemic.“We’re trying to get them to tell us a story,” says Dr Shopna Bag. “Where did it all start?”Bag is the director of the public health unit for the western Sydney local health district, which covers areas including Cumberland, Parramatta and Blacktown.The unit is based on the Cumberland hospital campus but works with all hospitals in the district, including neighbouring Westmead, as well as local health centres and pharmacies.The team includes a communicable diseases manager, surveillance nurses, public health nurses and public health officers. Since the arrival of Covid-19, it has had responsibility for joining the dots in cases such as an outbreak at the Rose of Sharon childcare centre in Blacktown.Case investigation and contact tracing work begins at the point of diagnosis. The unit receives a notification from a laboratory or the health department of a newly confirmed case. That case is assigned to a team member, often a nurse, who then calls the patient.In many cases, this phone call is the moment the patient learns they have coronavirus. For the clinician on the other side of the call, their first priority is the patient’s mental welfare and physical health.“Sometimes people are expecting the result, other times it’s a surprise,” says Dr Bhakti Vasant, a public health physician in Brisbane’s metro south public health unit.“It’s really important we gauge what people are feeling over the phone and try to build rapport.”The clinician will run through a questionnaire to correctly identify the patient. That is followed by a symptom check. How is the patient feeling today? Are they experiencing any respiratory difficulties? Are they in a hospital or at home in isolation? Do they have any chronic illnesses that place them in a higher risk category of Covid-19 patients?Vasant says there have been some cases where staff have had to immediately call an ambulance based on that first phone call.“If they’re short of breath or reporting chest pain we do not muck around,” she says.Once the caller establishes the patient is in isolation and well enough to speak, more detailed questioning can begin.While its purpose is interrogatory, the interview is kept as relaxed as possible, Bag says. For this reason, clinicians doing this type of work need multiple qualities: an eye for detail, emotional intelligence, and the ability to listen and make people feel comfortable. Unsurprisingly, they are often natural conversationalists, but with the ability to tease out information and follow threads.“We’re trying not to bombard them with questions, even though we need to tick a box,” Bag says.“We’re trying to do it in a way that says ‘just tell us the story’.”The caller asks the patient questions about when they first started to feel unwell. For some Covid-19 patients, the initial symptoms can be so mild they are mistaken for something else, such as hayfever.The caller talks to the patient about every cough, fever, ache, anything that felt a little off and together they identify the date the patient first began to show symptoms.This is done for two reasons. The first is to build a timeline back to the original source of the infection.The second is that the date of symptom onset determines the period in which the patient is considered contagious.Patients with Covid-19 are considered contagious 24 hours before they become symptomatic and this date is used as the starting point to identify close contacts who may have been exposed.The case investigator then works with the patient to build a timeline.This line of questioning can be a long process says Reid, who is the team investigations manager in the ACT’s health protection service.It is about retracing the patient’s steps, “day-by day, minute-by-minute”, covering every moment of the 14 days up to the first day of symptoms.They’ll use a range of tools, including the calendar on the patient’s mobile phone, if they have one, to try to reconstruct those two weeks. Sometimes, they’ll have the patient try to write a timeline for those 14 days.There are specific questions, such as has the patient travelled internationally or interstate? Where did they go, what mode of transport did they use? If they took a flight somewhere, did they then catch a taxi or Uber? Had they been at work, the gym, a wedding or birthday party?Email:\u0026nbspsign up for our\u0026nbspdaily coronavirus newsletterApp:\u0026nbspdownload it\u0026nbspand never miss the biggest storiesPodcast:\u0026nbsplisten to our daily episodes on\u0026nbspApple Podcasts,\u0026nbspSpotify\u0026nbspor search Full Story in your favourite appSometimes it will take multiple calls as the patient starts to recall their movements.“We don’t stop until we find a source,” Reid says.In some instances, a public health unit might receive several cases at once for which there appears to be a common source, such as a cruise ship with a known outbreak or an institution such as a school or church with other confirmed cases.But Bag says it is important not to make assumptions even if the source might seem obvious. They will still piece together all of the information in case the real clues lie elsewhere.“This is where we need to be patient and let them tell their story but also explain why we’re asking all these questions,” she says.The other important step in the process is identifying people who could be considered close contacts of the confirmed case. This is anyone who has had 15 minutes of face-to-face contact with the patient in their infectious period, or who has spent two hours in an enclosed space with them.Case investigators will seek information such as flight numbers and seat rows for patients who have travelled. They can then request a flight manifest from the airline to begin the work of identifying people sitting nearby.In the interview, the patient will be asked to remember who they’ve spent time with, at work, at the gym, any parties, religious services or nights out. Who do they live with? The greatest risks of exposure are in the household setting, so identifying household members is a priority in contact tracing.A list is put together and then contact tracers get to work tracking down and notifying those people.In some cases, the patient will be able to supply names and numbers and those iniduals might already be expecting a call. Or the public health unit might call a patient’s workplace and ask a manager to check their roster for particular days.On average, most patients will have nine or 10 close contacts. Some only have one.“People might have come back from overseas and gone straight to a hotel. Those are ideal situations, they’re very easy,” Reid says.“But we’ve had other instances around Australia where people have had weddings or parties. That’s when it becomes a lot more difficult.”The implication of all of this for a close contact is that they will have to isolate for 14 days. For this reason, contact tracers will also conduct an interview to verify that person meets the criteria for close contact.They will only identify the Covid-19 patient by name if the patient has consented.If a contact is required to go into isolation, some health districts have set up support services such as a daily SMS or call to check on symptoms and advise a test if need be.A case liaison team will also establish whether a patient or close contact needs assistance with things such as accommodation, medication or groceries for their isolation period.Government-backed modelling suggests each inidual infected with Covid-19 in Australia is passing it on to less than one person on average.Australia’s chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said on Thursday Australia’s high detection rate of Covid-19 cases showed the country’s testing and surveillance regime was highly effective.The teams  Australia spoke to said the majority of patients, and close contacts, were responsive and understood the reasons the contact tracing process was undertaken.“People are stressed, tired, not feeling well, you can hear that,” Bag says. “Once they know why we’re calling and that we’re here to help them and their families, everyone has been really cooperative.“It’s just that initial pressure. What does this mean for me, my work, my family?”Vasant says people have been “very understanding” as investigative and contact tracing teams cast their net as wide as necessary in a bid not to miss anyone who might have been exposed.She says the work these public health teams are doing to interrupt the chain of transmission is “really making a difference to the number of cases in Australia”.Teams will run through timelines multiple times. As the patient interview and contact tracing work comes together, they might have gathered information from multiple people.“It’s like detective work. You can’t rely on a single source of information. You have to take information from multiple sources to piece the puzzle together,” she says.“Sometimes one new piece of information can take the timeline back a few weeks and we go back to re-interview cases and contact more people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/754e39bf1a4be56233d2ce3ff4caa717d1dbe2e4/0_191_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96fdf4215baebe9bce01104237e6ff1c","title":"margaret atwoods lockdown diary life as an eccentric self isolationist","story":"How to make firelighters, combat squirrels and conduct a rubber chicken choir … the author shares practical tips from lockdown in CanadaAs the first world war dragged on, volunteer women’s groups of all kinds formed in aid of the troops in the trenches: bandage rolling, preserved foods box packing, knitting. My grandmother joined a knitting group in rural Nova Scotia. You started on washcloths, progressed to scarves then, if you were sufficiently adroit, you moved on to balaclavas and socks, and ultimately – the pinnacle! – to gloves. My grandmother was a terrible knitter. She never got beyond washcloths.I’ve often wondered about these knitting groups. What were they for, really? Were they providing much-needed knitted items, or were they boosting morale by giving a bunch of otherwise very anxious civilians, whose sons and husbands were in jeopardy, something to do with their hands while waiting, waiting, endlessly waiting? I can see the socks and gloves making it to the frontlines, but the washcloths? Photographs of muddy, cramped, stinky trench life don’t show much washing going on. And my grandmother’s wonky, hole-filled washcloths in particular – were they sent to a secret depot where they were unraveled, and their wool reclaimed for something more functional?So, in the spirit of my grandmother’s washcloths – not ultimately useful, perhaps, but let’s hope they focused the mind and gave a sense of accomplishment – I present some of my more bizarre self-isolation activities. You can do some of them at home. Though perhaps you won’t wish to.I won’t bother with the photo sorting, the purging of old files, the delving into storage trunks, the wonderment at some of the things found there – why did I save that, and what exactly is it? – or the reading of letters from boyfriends long gone now, or bald. I expect we are all doing something like that. Or the gardening, which would have happened anyway. Or the return to baking, something I used to do at industrial volume when there were teenagers around, and have made a tentative return to. Instead, I’ll move straight to the fire starters made from dryer lint, egg cartons and candle ends. Why should these clutter up landfill sites when you can make fire starters from them instead? The method was given to me by a group of female bush pilots who took me out to breakfast in Whitehorse, the Yukon, back in the 1990s, and I’ve been making them ever since. They are popular holiday gifts among certain of my easily pleased family members.Here’s what you do. Collect the lint from your dryer. Collect egg cartons, the cardboard variety. Collect candle ends. Stuff the lint into the pockets of the egg cartons. Melt the candle ends in a metal container kept for that purpose and set in a larger pan of boiling water. Do not melt them directly over an open flame. Pour the melted wax over the lint. When hardened, cut into cubes. To quote the bush pilots, who never took off for a flight into the trackless wilderness without some, just in case their plane went down: “Best damn fire starter you ever saw!”Another activity I’ve been doing lately is squirrel foiling. Hear a gnawing sound in the ceiling? These are your choices, in this part of the world: raccoons, possums, rats, squirrels, Google Earth. Probably squirrels, I thought, and so it proved to be. At first I foiled them by playing hot jazz and acid rock right under their gnawing station, but they got used to the wailing and screaming, so I climbed up a stepladder, placed a large steel bowl against the ceiling, and whacked it with a big metal serving spoon. Yes, I know, I shouldn’t have been doing that alone at night – the Younger Generation will scold when they read this – because people my age fall off ladders and break their necks, especially when not holding on because you need two hands for steel bowl banging. I won’t do it again, promise. (Until next time.)The hole having finally been located by the roofer – roofers can work at your house as long as they don’t come inside – I was able to climb out of a window on to a flat part of the roof and stuff the hole with hot pepper powder. (More hand-wringing by the Younger Gen, who kept saying: “Let me do it!” To which I replied: “You’re too big.” This was true – the Younger Gen tends to be taller, thanks to the postwar food glut of the 1950s – but the Younger Gen did help me get back in via a different stepladder. They have long arms.) End of squirrel gnawing. Don’t try this yourself. It’s not a recommendation. (Mad old grannies will do it anyway. I can’t stop them, and you won’t be able to either.)Not to worry. The pest guy came, and locked the squirrels out. Pest guys too (or pest gals) can work at your house as long as they don’t go into it.Those are my ersions. Now we’ll get down to the serious business: the remote events. These are multiplying like mice, since talks, festivals, fundraisers and shows that would once have been analogue, with real physical bodies gathered together in celebration and glee, quaffing, chattering, entertaining and applauding, have all been cancelled, and substitutes have had to be devised. Livestreams, videos, podcasts, radio interviews, FaceTime events in which you have to hold your phone at arms length from your face – all are swarming on to the internet, which has been crashing lately.Mary Beard, the two-fisted Cambridge classicist who understands crises, debacles and pandemics, being an authority on ancient Rome, asked me to do a remote item for the BBC Front Row Late show, which usually reviews theatre but now can’t because there isn’t any. “Just a little something,” she said, “as long as it’s on plagues.” This awakened the Kraken of my deep past – a childhood of reading horror literature, not only the Betty Crocker’s Picture Cookbook for proto-homemakers but also the collected work of Edgar Allan Poe. Who let that into the kiddie section of the library? Well, there isn’t any sex in it: that was probably the excuse and children are so fond of decaying corpses, especially those with all their teeth pulled out, as in “Berenice”. So me and “The Masque of the Red Death” go way back.Add to the mix my early career as a teenage puppeteer, and the fact that my baby sister, Ruth, and I had already watched all of the TV drama series Miss Fisher’s Murder Mysteries, and the devil found work for idle hands to do. We decided to stage “The Masque of the Red Death” using nothing but what could be found in the house. Out came the old Christmas wrapping paper and the saved-up bows and the stainless steel tableware. Prince Prospero is played by a champagne bottle, the courtiers by wine glasses, and the fortified abbey by the knives and forks. Never mind that you can’t go to the West End – you can watch “The Masque of the Red Death” instead. It’s amateur theatre at its most … at its most amateur.Then there was the hastily planned launch of the author-and-book show that will now be streamed regularly by the National Arts Centre in Ottawa, with Canadian authors presenting their spring-list books in one on the few locations available to them. My interlocutor was the honourable Adrienne Clarkson, a former governor general of Canada. We went to the University of Toronto at the same time in the late 50s and early 60s, though she went to Trinity, the Anglican college, and I to Victoria, founded by Methodists. They had gowns, we had moral earnestness. But Adrienne and I both studied  English language and literature, and what better match for a thrown-together online hour in which we discussed a lot of books we didn’t have and hadn’t read, but felt we would like to read? If university teaches you nothing else, it’s how to rabbit on about stuff you don’t actually know anything about. At one point my wifi froze and I had to go running around the house, holding up my device and looking for a signal. Just like the old days.On my plate now is the upcoming online bird extravaganza, a fun-packed substitute for two events we usually do in May at the height of the spring migration: SpringSong, on Pelee Island in the middle of Lake Erie, a stopover on a major flyway, and the Pelee Island Bird Observatory, the bird-banding and educational station on Pelee. We will try to recreate all the features of those two events, including the visiting authors, the Green Bird Race, and the Rubber Chicken Choir. As we’ll be streaming on Facebook Live, you can bring your own rubber chicken, wherever you are, and join in. I am the conductor.Meanwhile, my sister and her sewing machine are hurtling down the highway towards me at the speed of light well, not exactly, but faster than usual due to the scarcity of cars on the road. I have dug out my own ancient sewing machine, and after I’ve oiled it and figured out how to work it again, we are going to sew face masks for health workers. I’ve even found some elastic, in short supply on the ground these days: there must be a lot of face mask sewing going on. The result may be like my grandmother’s washcloths – not perfect, lopsided, but well meant. And, with hope, they will also be functional. Fingers crossed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a16d0a4579e9df28986d8a49e4b7c0084222ce4f/0_84_3559_2135/master/3559.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f29f4e2cfbcb330796ec6a26b6da65e","title":"us airlines empty planes coronavirus environment","story":"The coronavirus outbreak has provoked a string of unsettling sights, such as the sudden widespread use of masks, shuttered businesses and deserted streets. Another unusual phenomenon is also playing out in the skies – near-empty airplanes flying through the air.Slightly more than half the flights within the US have been canceled, leading to a slew of near-empty flights. Less than one in 10 seats on domestic flights were filled by passengers last week, according to an estimate by Dan Rutherford, aviation director at the International Council on Clean Transportation.“The evidence suggests that the number of people flying is dropping faster than the flights so there are a lot of empty planes,” he said. “The airlines are left to figure this out for themselves and they are playing catch-up.”This situation is leading to a “huge environmental waste”, Rutherford said, as planes burn huge amounts of fuel to transport just a handful of people around America.In March, Sheryl Pardo shared a video of her being upgraded to first class and given a personalized safety briefing after being the only passenger to check in to an American Airlines flight from Washington to Boston. Meanwhile, a Virgin Atlantic flight from London to New York subsequently carried just seven people.However, passenger numbers may well bounce back quickly following the end of the Covid-19 crisis.“You have dips around recessions but within two or three years it returns,” said Rutherford. “I imagine leisure travel will recover pretty quickly. In the boom years, airlines have eased off on attempts to improve fuel efficiency – what was going on was not sustainable. The million-dollar question is whether we will curb flying to protect the climate, as we are now doing to protect public health.”The US airline industry got $25bn in assistance in the recent stimulus package to deal with the sharp downturn in business. In return, the airlines are required to maintain a certain level of service, which may be leading to the near-empty flights.The economics of running an airline can also be counterintuitive in that it can sometimes be cheaper to fly a commercial airliner to a planned destination than pay for a spot to simply park it.“The novel coronavirus pandemic has had, and continues to have, a severe and unprecedented impact on the US airline industry,” a spokeswoman for the lobby group said, adding that flights are also shifting important cargo such as medical supplies, food and mail.Doug Parker, chief executive of American Airlines, said: “Those that are flying today are doing so for important reasons.” A spokesman for United said it was “still somewhat rare” for a single passenger to be on a flight and said that the company had made investments in more sustainable fuel to lower its carbon footprint.The commitment of airlines in general to addressing the climate crisis has been questioned during the coronavirus shutdown, however. Airlines are lobbying to rewrite the rules of a global agreement designed to tackle aviation emissions, with the coronavirus outbreak expected to make its targets tougher to meet.Campaigners accused airlines of attempting to “dodge their obligations”, but the industry said it was “a matter of survival”."},{"url":null,"title":"have you been affected coronavirus anywhere but westminster","story":"For our next episode of Anywhere but Westminster we would like to hear from you As the ’s Anywhere but Westminster video series continues about life in the coronavirus crisis, we want to hear from people directly affected by the illness itself.Do you have the virus right now, and are you enduring self-isolation?

Healthcare workers and public health bodies have often become the subject of people’s misplaced anger during pandemics. It is deeply concerning, however, to see this playing out again today on a global political scale.Divided, we will fail. No part of the world is unaffected by Covid-19 and it demands coordinated action to solve it. The US cannot keep coronavirus out unless the virus is also under control in the rest of the world. Thinking in terms of single nations or narrow political allegiances prolongs the crisis and deepens the impact on every country and community.Today’s meeting of G20 health ministers is a welcome opportunity to present a united front and make positive commitments. There must be no question of casting health and economic security against each other – each is essential to the other.The only way to end a pandemic and have confidence in easing lockdowns is with three vital tools: tests, treatments and vaccines. Rapid diagnostic tests so that we can track the virus, isolate those infected and shield the vulnerable. Effective medicines to save lives and reduce the severity and impact of the disease on our health systems. And vaccines to protect people and prevent transmission.Without these tools, we risk a rolling cycle of lockdowns and distancing measures as outbreaks ebb and flow around the world for months, if not years, to come.These tools will only come from scientific research and innovation. Only 100 days since the virus’s genome was sequenced, clinical trials are already testing well over 100 potential vaccines and drugs. But even as researchers around the world are pooling resources and ideas to progress the science as quickly as possible, huge international investments will be needed to turn their discoveries into practical global solutions.Right now, there is an urgent and immediate $8bn (£6.4bn) funding gap. If secured from governments and private sector donations in the next few weeks, this money can help achieve the scale of research and development we need. Processes that usually take years will be able to get underway in a coordinated way, rapidly generating global solutions to the pandemic. Any delay means opportunities missed, time and money wasted, more lives lost.Many people have spoken about the unprecedented nature of this global emergency. Our response must be unprecedented, too. Backed by the international community, the World Health Organization led the eradication of smallpox, the internationally coordinated use of polio vaccines and many more – but these achievements all took decades of effort.Now, we must pull together and implement a global solution to Covid-19. More will be needed to ensure that no matter where they are developed, all tests, treatments and vaccines are available to everyone in the world who needs them and at an affordable price. For as long as Covid-19 is out of control somewhere, it is a threat to us all.Science is the exit strategy, but as the European commission has recognised with its planned pledging conference, it will take a monumental global effort to tackle this virus. Governments, businesses and organisations across the whole of society, many not usually involved in public health, have to play essential roles.We cannot afford to pay any more attention to our geographic, social and political borders than the virus does. Every nation in the world has a duty to back our international coordinating bodies, such as the WHO, and find the way out of this crisis together.• Jeremy Farrar is director of the Wellcome Trust"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d52e7792cc11526de475e3dfafa2cf989f36ed9b/0_62_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b8525a8c8be0fa11cdec1cabaf6ad38","title":"ellen degeneres be kind what that means","story":"Recently, and not for the first time, the comedian’s public persona has appeared to be at odds with her private actionsSign up for the Week in Patriarchy, a newsletter​ on feminism and sexism sent every Saturday.“Be kind” Ellen DeGeneres says at the end of every episode of her eponymous show.

This stung as DeGeneres had recently announced on-air that she wanted to start filming again as soon as possible so she could support her staff and crew.DeGeneres isn’t personally responsible for every aspect of how her show is run, of course. But it certainly seems like a woman who is reportedly worth more than $330m and is one of the highest-paid stars on television, earning more than $50m a year, could be doing rather more to support the people who work under her. Particularly as many of her crew have worked on the show since it started 17 years ago. It’s worth noting that Jimmy Kimmel Live! stagehands, according to Variety, were paid from Kimmel’s own pocket during initial coronavirus shutdowns.Why is DeGeneres suddenly getting so much backlash and bad press? Well, for one thing, coronavirus has made us all sick to death of celebrity shenanigans. It’s hard for stars to seem relatable when they’re moaning about their mansions.More broadly, however, I think some of the animosity towards DeGeneres has to do with the way she exemplifies the hypocrisy around the concept of “civility”. Last year, for example, DeGeneres lectured us all on her friendship with George W Bush, a man who opposed same-sex marriage and whose own former counter-terrorism chief accused him of committing war crimes. “When I say, ‘Be kind to one another’, I don’t mean only the people who think the same way that you do,” DeGeneres said on her show, in response to criticism of her hobnobbing with Bush. “I mean be kind to everyone. Doesn’t matter.”I don’t want to completely slam DeGeneres. She’s done a lot of good in the world. It’s hard to overstate how brave it was for her to come out in 1997 her courage made life a lot easier for the next generation of queer people. According to a 2015 poll, Ellen did more to influence Americans’ attitudes about gay rights than any other celebrity or public figure. But if she wants to keep flogging merchandise with BE KIND on it, then she might want to start thinking a little harder about what those words actually mean. And I say that in the kindest possible way.Karen Ingala Smith, the founder of Counting Dead Women, a project that records the killing of women by men, has identified at least 16 suspected domestic abuse killings in the UK since the Covid-19 lockdown restrictions were imposed. The same period last year saw an average of five deaths. “The number of women killed by men over the first three weeks since lockdown is the highest it’s been for at least 11 years and is double that of an average 21 days over the last 10 years,” Smith said.“Those lucky enough to be in a position to stay at home, please, please do so,” the first daughter recently tweeted. Ivanka then flew from Washington DC to the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey to celebrate Passover.Laura Daniel, a New Zealand comedian, attempted to create Jacinda Ardern in cake form during a baking competition as a tribute to the prime minister. Let’s just say that the final result wasn’t exactly flattering. “Don’t bake your heroes,” Daniel advised.“A British woman in a long-term relationship with a 92-year-old German chandelier has been told that her attraction to historic light fittings is not considered to be a protected sexual orientation,” the  reports. Some light relief in these dark times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4401944363a2021278478eee2c8143d08417b17b/0_149_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef92b80e3ced1b429bc3a190463ebf8e","title":"lockdown is doing wonders for the royal family even fergie gets a look in","story":"Prince Andrew’s former wife reading to the kiddies on YouTube. What a boost to the national morale• See all our coronavirus coverageIn forthcoming journals of this plague year, I hope whoever gets to write the canonical version will make a particular note of 15 April. This was the day the Duchess of York, ex-wife of Prince Andrew and ex-host to the late Jeffrey Epstein, the child sex offender, used the crisis to relaunch herself as the lockdown kiddies’ choice.Introducing Storytime with Fergie and Friends, the Duchess, surrounded by soft toys, said children needed “a little bit of magic”. She was, she confided, in the Windsor home she shares with a host of novelty teapots and also Prince Andrew (whose testimony is still sought by a number of Epstein’s victims), in her “favourite place ever… with children”.Her horrendous reading of Hairy Maclary From Donaldson’s Dairy, featuring one shriek so unhallowed that a doggie soft toy seemed, hurling itself out of shot, to prefer extinction, had already given way, by day two, to a performance of one of her own titles, Budgie Goes to Sea, a rudimentary work, for the uninitiated, about a duchessomorphised helicopter.“There’s four books in the series,” the duchess said, shoving the cover at tots whose finances may be more straitened after the recession than she imagines. “And” – anticipating the question preschoolers invariably ask about a new book – “guess who the author is? Mmm, I wonder, it could be me.”It could. And whatever the deficiencies of her performance – there may be parents At This Time who will seize the chance to reduce tiny children to mute terror – the duchess’s renewed bid for recognition suggests, regardless of the prospects for Budgie’s regeneration, that there has never been a better time to be a British royal.Pre-Covid-19, following Andrew’s Newsnight interview and their respective Epstein associations – the duchess has apologised for taking a loan from the paedophile – the York exes appeared fairly terminally beyond, if not rehabilitation, definitely the second panto wedding they’d hoped for. Now there is talk of reviving it. Contagion has, as well as reducing to a trickle the previously relentless Epstein updates, generated a surge of public deference so undiscriminating that the Yorks can reasonably hope to benefit. On Instagram, Andrew puts his head above the Windsor parapet as if he has done nothing, these past decades, except pack treats for carers, next to his never-estranged helpmeet. “The York Family are a wonderful and steadfast unit and through this crisis, are continuously helping others,” oozes an aide.As unpromising as this scheme might look, the family can surely take heart from the recent transformation of the prime minister from an inept and blubbery philanderer into something more closely resembling the glorious sun itself. But the sudden tolerance for rhapsodies about Boris Johnson’s nation-binding, lie-obliterating invincibility, even from writers whose analysis does not usually recall Unity Mitford’s, appears to be just one aspect of a widespread longing for comfort from on high, or wherever a significant royal is currently embedded, along with any necessary suspension of critical faculties.If it was likely and welcome that the Queen, as a revered survivor of earlier crises, would be a calming national presence in this one, the Prince of Wales possibly had less reason to hope, like his dependent son and daughter-in-law, that their contributions – from spiritual input to book lists to a throwback photograph of Prince Charles as Macbeth – would be equally gratefully received. It’s not long since Charles was subjected to ritual mockery about his transport needs (including a £20,000 journey from London to Port Talbot) and other disrespectful questions about his defence of a paedophile bishop. Sagewise, his alternative wisdom was not doing much better. But now a man who always wanted to be a symbol actually is a symbol.“My entire life has been so far motivated by a desire to heal,” Charles said in 2002. “To heal the isions between intuitive and rational thought, between mind and body and soul, so that the temple of our humanity can once again be lit by a sacred flame.” And it appears the cynics were wrong: he can indeed light humanity’s temple and, what’s more, light it remotely, from Birkhall. Certainly, nobody seems now to be asking who’s living in the prince’s other seven or so homes. Or who was squeezing his toothpaste when he had Covid-19. Or where his already considerable contagion travel savings are going. In the current climate, it could sound all too much like siding with the virus.The Cambridges, meanwhile, are earning their share of the Queen’s sovereign grant – and, incidentally, triumphing over the Sussexes, whose departure could scarcely have been worse timed – by way of encouragement and hints from their laptops in Anmer Hall and various Instagram offerings. The reminder #StayHomeSaveLives appeared next to some Easter daffodils at Kensington Palace, presumably empty at the time. Instead, the couple are self-isolating and home-schooling in Norfolk, amid all the delightful chaos, they like to emphasise, of any other young family sitting out the terror in a minimally staffed 10-bedroom mansion. They’ve been through “ups and downs”, they assured the BBC, “like a lot of families”. And like Charles, they seem so far to have been spared the kind of questions endured both by celebrity isolators declaring similar fellowship from country estates and by politicians unwilling to submit to exemplary pay cuts.Throughout the Blitz, obliquely referred to in the Queen’s broadcast, her parents stayed in the capital, to demonstrate solidarity. It says much about the popularity of her successors – if not the scale of public anxiety – that their more relaxing choices have not led to any obvious loss of allegiance. On the contrary: royal faces loom everywhere, with what feels like wartime frequency. “Why don’t we conduct more business from home?” William urges, from his sitting room. “I do hope post this that there’s a new way of working.” And so, we can safely say, does Aunt Fergie."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a648b31556502880fca669c97db219e3cab97504/0_219_6568_3941/master/6568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ee3f9d8f01b56c861c746b347203b08","title":"me a domestic goddess no i just like a clean house","story":"Joanna Trollope is wrong to turn housework into some kind of battle between the sexesAnybody felt deeply fulfilled while cleaning the lavatory lately? No, me neither.Where to start? Ms Trollope seems to be arguing that women perceive the “domestic domain” as some Game of Thrones-type scenario, where they perch on giant dragons, refusing to give up their kingdom. At home, we hiss, spit and plot to undermine our emotionally castrated menfolk in order to pursue our sacred lady-calling, to… what exactly: stick a wash on, mop the kitchen? I’m sure most women agree that we can think of far better things to get “emotionally ambitious” or even “controlling” about.This is the central insult embedded in most discussions about housework: that women give a hot damn, that feminine identity is entwined in something as dreary as dragging around a vacuum cleaner. It requires discussion only because, even today, it remains a gendered tinderbox of unfairness and grievance. Not just that (it can also be about class and society), but which gender is lumbered with most housework (take a wild guess) remains a useful barometer of true equality in the home.It’s surely clearer than ever right now (with us all jammed in together) that mythologising housework is a mug’s game. It is essentially about practicality, not emotions or power-plays. In my experience, most women don’t orgasm while cleaning loos, process emotional pain as they polish taps or feel omnipotent as they change duvet covers. Just like a man, they’ll think a job needs doing, so they do it.The biggest lie ever told to women – and about women – is that they find domestic chores any more interesting, fulfilling or defining than men do. As Trollope must herself have noticed (having her own oeuvre summed up by a domestic appliance), women are only diminished by such a false and reductive view. No one in their right mind would scheme and manipulate to do more housework. Women are generally happy for men to control and dominate in this boring and repetitive “domain”.Knock yourselves out, guys, we’ll be lying on the sofa, surfing Netflix, chucking down chocolate biscuits, feeling all sad and disenfranchised.Anyone want to take a bite out of New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern? She’s now available in cake form, but you’d need to be exceptionally hungry and desperate.Comedian and television presenter Laura Daniel has said she’s “deeply sorry” to Ardern after an attempt to pay tribute to her in cake form went awry. Daniel was responding to the challenge of making a cake without flour, depicting a New Zealand icon, and posting it on Instagram. At first glance, the cake resembles the creature that climbed out of the well in The Ring, but closer inspection reveals it to be so much more than that, while simultaneously managing to be so much less.Based on Ardern’s cover shot for the biography, An Extraordinary Leader, the cake is anything but ordinary. The ghostly pale icing is smeared on as if in some confused baking-themed “dirty protest”. There are blackly dribbling eyebrows and lank liquorice strands of hair. The nose is a slightly bigger dollop of icing. Blue eyes stare out horribly. The representation of Ardern’s red top makes it appear as if the cake has had its throat slit. The daubed lips say “Joaquin Phoenix’s Joker just found your lipstick”. And what Daniel’s cake lacks in flour it makes up for in realistic teeth.Never mind apologising, Daniel should be congratulated – this must be the first cake to say: “Eat me… before I eat you.” While Ardern has been applauded for her leadership during the coronavirus outbreak, Daniel has also provided a valuable public service. With people in the UK and across the world taking up lockdown baking, her cake is a masterclass in what not to do. People can take comfort in the fact that, however dodgy their baking, it will never be as bad as Daniel’s.Obviously it’s vitally important to observe the lockdown. Still, are some people taking their surveillance duties a little too seriously, to the point where a citizen’s arrest culture is sprouting?Large numbers of people are tipping off the police about neighbours or challenging people in public spaces. In the main, fair enough – I’ve also felt like saying something when heavy-breathing desperadoes jog past, splashing sweat around. And, sorry young people, you shouldn’t be meeting to enthusiastically snog on park benches.However, while social policing has to happen, does there need to be so much of it when it comes to minor infractions? Occasionally, it’s necessary to report someone to the police, or have a word in public, and sometimes it really isn’t. It seems perfectly possible to, say, pass someone sitting alone on their coat in the park, or two people standing far apart having a brief chat, without erupting in righteous rage and laying down the law."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d0b9ffc39b44379a6d0564ff1610a5baec89264/0_139_3087_1852/master/3087.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de05fbb405d397e8bfbd869b91305509","title":"what mrs america gets right and what it gets wrong about 70s feminism","story":"Mrs America gives Phyllis Schlafly a depth in fiction that was lacking in history but Shirley Chisholm is refreshingly portrayed as more than just a martyrThe real hero of Mrs America, the new FX miniseries chronicling the early 1970s political battle over the Equal Rights Amendment, is Phyllis Schlafly. Schlafly, the conservative movement leader who led the antifeminist backlash against the amendment, styled herself a housewife and mother of six, but really she was an educated, driven and ambitious professional political operator, skilled in forging alliances among unlikely counterparts and manipulating the motivations of others toward her own ends.In the miniseries, a slick, beautifully shot portrait of 1970s America, she is played by Cate Blanchett, who masterfully shows Schlafly finding an outlet for her own frustrated political ambitions in the anti-ERA fight, and rising from a minor conservative commentator on the lunatic fringe to the primary voice of social conservatism on the national stage. As the ERA is defeated – going from a bipartisan shoo-in that sailed through the Senate to an embattled, controversial document that meets resistance in every statehouse – the show encourages us to see the downfall of the major political effort of the second wave feminist movement as the result, paradoxically, of one woman’s phenomenal personal determination.The realities of history were a bit more complicated than that. Though Schlafly was the face of the conservative opposition to the ERA, the show depicts her as that movement’s instigator and sole intellectual origin, with male politicians and movement conservatives shruggingly falling into line behind her. The show depicts her, too, as having resentments about male arrogance and entitlement in her own life, a strain of her character that is meant to draw parallels between Schlafly and the feminist leaders she opposes, such as Gloria Steinem, Bella Abzug, Betty Friedan and Shirley Chisholm. We see the women on either side of the ideological ide smarting at the pains of their own thwarted ambitions, and enduring sexual aggression from men for the sake of achieving their goals: Schlafly wanted to be a congresswoman Chisholm wanted to be president Steinem wanted to pass a law through Congress legalizing abortion rights.None of them got what they wanted. In one scene, Schlafly, contemplating a second run for Congress, lets a slimy Washington insider squeeze her waist and make a lewd comment about her dress later, rage flashes across her face when men in a meeting ask her to take notes for them. She steps out of the office and snaps at the young secretary instead. In the offices of Ms Magazine, Steinem lets the publisher make a gross remark about her legs, because she needs his money to keep it in print.These moments are meant to endear Schlafly to viewers, and at the same time to make sure that the show’s politics are clear: despite who the protagonist is, Mrs America is ultimately on the feminists’ side. But these attempts to draw parallels between Schlafly’s ambitions and anger and that of the feminists risks reducing the differences between them to the temperamental or circumstantial, rather than the ideological and political.In real life, Schlafly was not so conflicted. Though her public life and fierce style conflicted tellingly with her prescriptions for women’s behavior, such as modesty, domesticity and obedience, she was a fierce misogynist who wrote and testified passionately that women who experienced sexual harassment brought men’s aggression on themselves. The show is a bit too generous to Schlafly here, and one can’t help but think that it is trying to make its subject worthy of its casting: Blanchett, in a stunning performance, is too skilled and nuanced an actor to play a figure of such uncomplicated contempt as Schlafly herself really was. Mrs America gives Schlafly a depth in fiction that was not there in history.Though Schlafly remains the central figure, the show attempts to treat its other women with interest and generosity as the fight around the ERA progresses through the politically hectic summer of 1972. Gloria Steinem, played willowy and glamorous by Rose Byrne, has become the face of the feminist movement, but she is torn between the cantankerous, uncompromising idealism of Betty Friedan (Tracey Ullman) and the appeasing, results-focused pragmatism of Bella Azbug (Margo Martindale).In the early scenes with Steinem, as she launches Ms Magazine and attempts to harness her considerable media appeal in the service of Shirley Chisholm’s presidential bid, the show veers towards portraying Steinem as a victim of her own celebrity and good looks – another historical mistake, as in reality Steinem was a savvy and deliberate manipulator of these. But as the show progresses, the script veers from underestimating Steinem to seeing her more clearly, as she attempts, in vain but with the best of intentions, to manipulate a corrupt political system to admirable political ends.But the show’s real triumph is the actor Uzo Aduba, criminally underrated and radiant as Shirley Chisholm. Fraught, frustrated, paranoid and betrayed at the end of her presidential bid, Chisholm is portrayed not as the one-dimensional martyr that feminist history so often makes her, but as an earnest, principled advocate who suffers deep pain at the racist and sexist determination of those around her to underestimate and overlook her talents. Her presidential bid, and her unwillingness to end it as the 1972 Democratic national convention in Miami nears, causes a conflict among the feminists between pragmatism and potential, the dream of a free world with rights and dignity for all women and the need to get results to alleviate the ongoing suffering of sexism. The choices they make, and the way Chisholm herself responds, reveal that this is a false choice, and a trap. Still, when her friends abandon her and her presidential campaign is forced to fold, we can see her pain and disappointment. Her principle and idealism is not depicted in simplistic terms as pure or morally aspirational, but also as tragic, and very lonely. The show gives Chisholm and its viewers a great deal of respect here, by taking her suffering seriously.Mrs America sets out to show history as made by human beings, complete with insecurities, hopes, relatable fears and bad motivations. In this sense, it is not unlike other political dramas that have attempted to depict the agents of power and politics as relatable, familiar and human. In some of its scenes, where women in colorful 70s garments and elaborate hairdos exchange banter while walking briskly through the halls of power, the show can feel a bit like Aaron Sorkin’s The West Wing, though it is a great deal worldlier and more skeptical. Mrs America is not the first show to explore history as a mosaic of human egotism, hopefulness and frailty. But it is one of the first where history is made by the egotism, hopefulness and frailties of women."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6dcfbfdf34b3d03fc5927d4da1a1efe90f4bc72/0_85_4954_2973/master/4954.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7085641c463b2b879d55721f1b7a672","title":"after coronavirus a no deal brexit cartoon","story":"The government has said it will refuse any request to extend the transition•You can buy your own print of this cartoon"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53bbd5044449a2943f83a8f9b024c1d6e097cf81/0_143_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3427310f220ec04ad23541c85166312","title":"opportunity knocks how lockdown is opening doors for new creative talent","story":"Aspiring writers and directors now have a rare chance to impress producers and publishers with time on their handsCameras have stopped rolling, book launches are postponed and actors are all “resting”. It looks as if nothing is moving in the world of entertainment and storytelling, yet from Hollywood to the major the publishing houses of London and New York, the talent scouts and production companies are working overtime to complete unfinished projects and find new tales to tell.The frenzy of backroom activity is creating unusual opportunities for novice stars of the future. For once, aspiring writers and wannabe directors are in demand.“We are scouring the internet looking for cool short films,” said Aram Tertzakian, co-founder of Santa Monica-based XYZ Films, the company behind Welsh director Gareth Evans’s recent action hits The Raid and Apostle. “We’ve been going back to filmmakers we have worked with before as well, like Gareth, and developing new projects with them. If we are nimble, then we can get them up and running before the other content providers gear up again.”While producers are prospecting for talent they would not normally have had time to find nor develop, half-finished films and dramas are using CGI and other special effects to complete projects at speed.Finding the raw material, the best new writing for books and filmed drama, is also being prioritised. Literary scouts, agents and publishers say they are reading more and looking ahead.“We have been busy, as there is quite a lot of action out there,” said literary scout Catherine Eccles, of Eccles Fisher Associates. “It is really lively and major buyers, like Amazon, Disney and Netflix, are calling and saying ‘what have you got?’ They’ve had to close down their productions, so are putting everything into development. And, of course, subscriptions have spiked, so they have the money, too.”Recent experience has shown the biggest hits, television shows such as Killing Eve or Stranger Things, can come from unknown writers. As a result, Independent Talent Group, one of the leading entertainment agencies, has urged its agents to get to imaginative writers before the competition does.Eccles has also seen an altered emphasis in her work with clients in 20 countries. “There is quite a bit of corona-writing going on, of course,” she said. “Some publishers are being opportunistic, rushing out lockdown-inspired work, but generally agents are looking for something fresh.”The reception of XYZ’s latest hit, Vivarium, directed by Irishman Lorcan Finnigan and starring Jesse Eisenberg, has benefited from the way its theme of incarceration chimes with audience experience but, on the whole, Tertzakian believes lockdown is not affecting his search for new stories. “Peoples tastes won’t change, but their viewing habits already have. They are used to watching high quality content at home and this will accelerate that. Our bet has always been on smart genre, that is sci-fi, horror and action.”And if there is a sheaf of typed pages in your bottom drawer, now is the time to send in that screenplay or manuscript.“At HarperCollins, we’re still actively looking for new submissions and the lack of commute has given some people more time to read,” said Phoebe Morgan, an editor at HarperFiction, who signed up a new author this month.“At Avon HarperCollins we’re hosting an online book festival, and telling everyone that tunes in that we’re now open to unsolicited manuscripts. In other words, you do not have to have a literary agent to be able to submit.”The company has also opened up its website so that authors can send in work directly. Signing a new author, to be published next year by HarperFiction, “was a lovely moment and a bright spot of positivity in a difficult time,” said Morgan. “We want new content and a full, exciting list for 202122, when this is all over.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe12f65605d563fef03ac97336034c67be449354/0_10_7360_4414/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad60d460222af118c28945df8722eb21","title":"covid 19 a blessing for pangolins","story":"Pangolins are the world’s most trafficked mammals, but there is evidence that they were the source of the new coronavirus – which could end the trade Covid-19 is a human disaster. However, for one group of animals, there may be a silver lining. Pangolins are one of the most heavily trafficked animals in the world, and as a result they are endangered. But in the past few weeks they have been linked to the initial outbreak of the Covid-19 disease in China. The evidence is inconclusive, but it has already prompted the Chinese government to take action. If more actions against the wildlife trade follow, the incident could prove to be a turning point for pangolin conservation.A key question is where Covid-19 came from. Many animals carry coronaviruses and are potential sources of infection. That is important to know, if only because it should help us prevent future outbreaks. Several ideas have been proposed, but arguably the most dramatic is that pangolins were the source.Pangolins look like scaly anteaters. Uniquely among mammals, their bodies are covered in hard protective scales made of keratin: the same material as our nails. They feed on insects such as ants and termites, and are often nocturnal and shy. While they look like anteaters, they are not closely related to them, and their closest living relatives are actually carnivorans: the group that includes wolves and cats.There are eight species of pangolin. Four live in Africa and four in Asia. All are at risk of extinction, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Two of the African species are considered vulnerable and two are endangered. Of the Asian species, one is endangered while the other three are critically endangered.Pangolins are illegally hunted and traded for two main reasons. First, their meat is considered a delicacy in several south-east Asian countries, especially China and Vietnam. And second, their scales are used in Chinese traditional medicine. As a result, they are the world’s most trafficked mammals.However, the results had not been published at that stage, so other scientists could not examine them in detail. Meanwhile, there were many other possibilities. The virus could have come from an animal and seafood market in Wuhan, where many species were held. Animals in such markets are often kept in closely packed, unsanitary conditions, with many people nearby: a perfect opportunity for a virus to jump species. Many pointed the finger at bats: the virus is genetically similar to those in bats, and it would not be the first time a disease passed from bats to humans. There was also a study linking the virus to one found in snakes, but this is now considered unlikely.However, the Chinese government was already lurching into action. On 24 February, China announced an immediate ban on trading and eating many wild animals, including pangolins. Officials began shutting down wild animal markets across the country.This was the latest in a series of steps that ought to reduce the pangolin trade. Back in 2016, the international trade in pangolins was entirely banned by the 183 nations that signed up to the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites). All eight pangolin species were placed in Appendix I of the Convention, giving them the strictest protection currently possible.However, so far this does not seem to have resulted in a drop in the number of pangolins traded, says Xu Ling, China director at wildlife trade monitoring group Traffic. The trade continues but the nature of the shipments has changed. “Before 2016 we could find frozen pangolin bodies, the meat smuggled in from other parts of south-east Asia to China,” says Ling. Nowadays most shipments are purely pangolin scales. Often they come from Africa, after being illicitly shipped out via Nigeria.More recently, in August 2019, China’s state insurance providers announced that they would stop covering medicines made from pangolin scales. The move took effect in January 2020.Against this background, it is unclear what impact China’s new ban on eating wild meat will have on pangolins. “Even without this ban, pangolin meat consumption was forbidden in China,” says Ling, as pangolins had protected status. This was reflected in the shift to importing scales. These are only legal if they come from certified sources but, as so often happens, the traders find ways around that. In the longer term, the loss of insurance funding may undercut the scale market.Meanwhile, the idea that pangolins played a role in the emergence of Covid-19 has not gone away.“It’s pretty clear the bat serves as the reservoir for this,” says Andersen. The question is how the virus travelled from bats to humans. “We are entertaining two different scenarios.”The key question is how the virus acquired certain sequences of its genome, which allow it to bind strongly to human cells and thus infect them. The bat virus does not have these sequences.One possibility is that the bat virus made the jump to humans several months before the outbreak was detected. These early viruses would not have been especially infectious or dangerous, but they could have mutated and evolved to acquire the key genetic sequences that made them infectious.The alternative possibility is that there was an intermediate host. “That’s where the pangolins come in,” says Andersen. While the pangolin virus as a whole is less similar to Sars-CoV-2 than the bat virus, the pangolin virus genome does have the crucial binding sequences. This is what Shen, Xiao and their colleagues found – and it has now been supported by a further study from another Chinese group.Furthermore, a study published on 26 March in Nature discovered viruses closely related to Sars-CoV-2 in pangolins that had been smuggled into China. These viruses had binding sequences similar to those in the human viruses.“Where it’s really important is where they’re identical,” says Andersen. “While the bat virus overall is more similar, in the regions where it really matters it’s actually quite different.”This suggests that the bat and pangolin viruses met, perhaps in the same host, and exchanged genes. Some of the bat viruses ended up with the key binding sequences from the pangolin viruses, enabling them to infect humans and unleash a pandemic. “Recombination is frequent in these types of viruses,” says Andersen. “It’s speculative, but it’s highly likely that that’s how we ended up with this new virus.”A similar story played out before the Sars outbreak of 2002-2004. The original source of the virus was wild bats, and in 2017 researchers managed to identify a cave in China where the bats carry viruses that are virtually identical to Sars. However, the virus was probably passed to humans via civets, which are cat-like animals, leading to China imposing a temporary ban on selling civets. The more recent Mers outbreak probably moved from bats to humans via camels.However, says Andersen, we cannot yet be sure which scenario is correct. Even if there was an intermediate host, it may not have been pangolins.The question of whether pangolins contributed to the Covid-19 outbreak will not be settled any time soon. “It’s probably going to be a long, drawn-out question,” says Andersen. Resolving the origin of Sars took years.But it may be crucial to ending the pangolin trade, because doing so requires two things. The first is strict enforcement of the rules, which China seems to want to do – it was stepping up enforcement even before the outbreak. The second is for people to stop buying pangolin products. If there is no demand, the illegal trade will become unprofitable, and suppliers will abandon it.“Just the fact there’s been all this publicity about the potential link to pangolins will probably lead to plummeting demand for them,” says Richard Thomas, head of communications at Traffic in Cambridge.The realisation that wildlife markets allow diseases to spread to people may spur action. When China announced the ban, the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) called it “a timely, necessary and critical step” – not just for safeguarding the wild animals, but for human health. “This public health crisis must serve as a wake-up call to end the unsustainable use of endangered animals and their parts, whether as exotic pets, for food consumption or for their perceived medicinal value.”In the best-case scenario, it will not just be pangolins that benefit. Reducing the demand for illegally traded wildlife will help many species – and protect us all from future pandemics into the bargain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/849b3a6ca7a2f430a3e4ed0bf15da446e7d0afea/0_0_1000_1000/master/1000.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=39815443e613f177784c78c5c9ee3678 2020w","title":"10 things the lockdown has taught me about food","story":"I’m always hungry, I love my corner shop – and I really don’t need to buy sumac. Now bring on the Angel Delight…Having long thought of myself as someone who cooks a lot, it turns out this was self-delusion of the worst order. I’m exhausted by all the cooking: not only the labour involved, since shopping now involves so much walking and queuing, but also by the constant whirring in my brain as I work out what might be made from whatever is in the house, and how best any leftovers might be eked out. Waking at three in the morning, I scroll through a list of those I love and miss, after which I quickly set to wondering whether yellow sprouting broccoli (as opposed to purple) is good for anything at all (answer: it isn’t).Relatedly: restaurants. Oh, my heart. What I wouldn’t give for a margherita with extra anchovies at Pizza Express escargots at Brasserie Zedel in London’s Piccadilly battered cod at the Magpie Cafe in Whitby a curry more authentic than one of my own a steaming bowl of pho a pretty plate of sushi.I’m prey, in my gilded cage, to all sorts of cravings. Foods bought and eaten in this period after a long absence: peanut butter, grapefruit, Frosties, Ferrero Rocher, beef shin. Next up: Angel Delight.On the subject of shin. With time on my hands, I decided to make a ragu like the one famously served at Trullo, in north London, the recipe for which is controversially not in its cookbook – and so, I joined the line at James Elliott, our blessed butcher, where I got the last piece of shin. Happiness! But then he said: “Have a nice weekend, madam” and I was lost I only just made it out of the door before the weeping began. Whoever could have guessed that stewing steak with a side of kindness would ever make me feel so emotional? (The ragu, by the way, was worth the half bottle of wine I chucked in it, and the five hours it took to cook. Not to boast, but it was the most delicious thing I’ve ever made.)I delivered two portions of this stew in a care package, complete with menu card and After Eights, to a friend who must isolate for 12 weeks. When he later sent me a photograph of his dinner tray all set up and ready to go, I realised all over again how much people love to be cooked for, and how happy it makes me to do so .Years ago, we began referring to our local Turkish store as The Shop That Has Everything. But now I realise that it really does have everything. It’s wonderful, and not a little chastening, the way that we’ve been brought to a new appreciation of those who serve us – the smiles exchanged over bunches of coriander and bottles of bleach! – whether at Sainsbury’s or in our corner shops.Goodbye sumac! None of us are in the market right now for recipes that require kaffir lime leaves or a pinch of lovage. Basically, we want to know if there’s any easily achievable dish involving tinned tomatoes that we’ve yet to make.How’s your appetite? I’m ravenous, but I know this isn’t real hunger. It’s born of boredom, anxiety and the simple fact that there’s more food in the house than usual. What’s especially alarming is that it takes me less than 20 seconds to walk from my home pilates studio – amazing what you can fit behind a sofa – to the fridge.I perhaps like a glass of wine with my dinner a little too much at this point, something that substituting the word “refreshed” for the word “pissed” does not, I fear, effectively hide.Life is meals, as James Salter once said. I now know, as I perhaps never fully did before, the truth of this. Here is comfort and togetherness, structure and ritual. Here, even in the sad moments, is happiness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b482bb3f3085a9cb454290cbd23e25a43b4b463/0_1864_6200_3717/master/6200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c14d881c2365a4e00c20b5833d07d7b4","title":"anoushka shankar dad ravi dal never cook","story":"The musician and daughter of Ravi Shankar talks about Bengali food, having George Harrison as an uncle and being Asian in CaliforniaI was born in 1981 and raised as an only child, so a lot of this will be about my mum. I’m remembering the lovely food she made. And I’m picturing this kitchen with a really odd, red linoleum floor, check red. I stood next to her a lot at the sink, while she was washing and I was drying – it’s a good time and place to chat. I never really cooked alongside her, but I don’t know why.Mum’s home food was comfy, exquisite and she was also capable of the most wonderful gourmet food. She’d mix the rice and dal with stuff and roll these easy-to-pick-up extra-softened little balls of rice. I have a very vivid memory of them. I think she’s the best cook in the world. Lots of people say that about their own mothers, but many people say it about my mother. Some of my mother’s Indian friends’ daughters would be learning to cook with their mother and they’d tease me about learning sitar with my dad, Ravi Shankar, instead. It was nothing nasty but I developed a complex about it.I ate Bengali food after my parents married and Dad started living with us, in both Willesden and in Delhi for three years, and then we all moved to California. Dad said he could make a really good dal, but I never saw him cook during the whole time we lived together.My memories of mealtimes are a real bleed of music and food. Music never really stopped in the music room, because everyone would move out to the table with their sitars. My dad would have an idea and we’d all be keeping time at the table, singing along, keeping patterns. And so many artists coming through, with amazing discussions around me.George Harrison became my uncle – not by blood but through love. It’s sort of an Indian cultural thing. He was deeply into the ayurvedic system and often talked to me about that. George and I were close and he was very jovial. I mean, both he and my dad were real jokesters, so there was a lot of laughter at the table.Moving to California made things better, somehow. In London, there’d been a real self-consciousness about being Asian. I felt that in California it didn’t mean anything to anyone – no one knew anything about India! – and that I could just make my own identity.Food is quite tricky for younger people who move and travel. I see it in my own kids now. Milk’s different in different countries bread’s totally different. So, I remember getting quite teary whenever we moved. But usually only for a couple of days.One thing I’m really finicky about is having proper kettles around. So I always carry one in my suitcase. I feel protected when I’m holding a really hot mug of tea.FOODA good salad full of protein, vegetables, leaves.RESTAURANTI love scrambled eggs at the Wolseley as a special, decadent brunch. The texture is just perfect – really creamy and sort of done but not done. I can’t get them right at home.

Though what seems likely to be remembered is that when the gravy train hit the buffers the national sport could not agree on anything.Not the right way to go about trimming the enormous wages of players now being mothballed, not a unified approach to the outgoings on non-playing staff in the absence of matches and gate income, not a sensible way to bring a disrupted season to an end and certainly not a timescale for when the dread prospect of fulfilling what remains of the fixture list behind closed doors may actually take place.A Premier League conference that aimed to nail down the last detail ended on Friday without a satisfactory conclusion being reached. The intention is still to see the season completed but drawing up a detailed schedule was just too difficult when “all dates are tentative”. No one was particularly surprised. Everyone’s dates are tentative at the moment not just football’s and one imagines the Premier League representatives knew the futility of their task before they even opened discussions.The very idea of trying to work out a timetable a day after the government had prolonged its indefinitely extendable lockdown policy by another three weeks was optimistic at best but the current stasis is being challenged by other sports in other countries. In addition, because of the size and complexity of the financial obligations the Premier League must find a way to discharge, it was probably felt a wait-and-see policy was not an option, particularly as the likelihood of clubs losing out-of-contract players if the season goes past 30 June is a real and pressing concern.When, inevitably, the only course that could be agreed on was to wait and see it became clearer than ever that football does not have all the answers, or indeed any of the answers. Perhaps we should already have known that given the number of U-turns over the problem of staff furloughing in the past few weeks.Mistakes have been made, there will be more of them, and due to the interconnectivity of football it is hard to imagine there will not be further U-turns or frantic backtracking before everything returns to normal.Domestic leagues want their own programmes completed first, which is understandable because they each comprise 20 or so clubs whose priority is to return to playing each other. Uefa, on the other hand, has a great deal invested in the Champions League, which Europe’s governing body is now saying can be played to a conclusion in late August, traditionally the time of year when the football season gets under way.Somewhere between these conflicting desires that other football tradition, a close season, is being squeezed out of existence. Some smaller countries, such as Belgium, have already indicated a willingness to simply write off this season as spoiled and start one as normal in late summer, though that option is not really open to bigger leagues where the financial implications of promotion and relegation run into many millions of pounds.Yet Belgium’s nuclear option is not without adherents in this country. An informal BBC survey of football fans has revealed that a majority of those who responded favoured the scrapping of the present season over the unappetising alternatives of playing behind closed doors or extending the league through summer.Such a course has simplicity in its favour, if not fairness, though it is doubtful whether many Liverpool fans would support it. There is no doubt Jürgen Klopp’s side are acknowledged champions. Everyone from Pep Guardiola downwards was saying that months ago, though there now seems no way their success can be recognised without compromise. Liverpool do not want to win their first title in 30 years in an empty stadium and neither do they wish to see the trophy awarded to Anfield along with an asterisk after an uncompleted season.The Spanish Football Federation has just unilaterally announced that the present top four will take the Champions League qualifying positions in the event of La Liga’s season being cut short or abandoned. That may appear a reasonable default position in the event of a worst-case scenario, though it happens that everyone in Spain’s top ision has played the same number of games.The same is not true of the Premier League, where Aston Villa, for instance, have a game in hand on most because of their involvement in the Carabao Cup final. Any notion Aston Villa may be relegated without playing that game in hand is a nonstarter, because as it stands at the moment three points would take them out of the bottom three, with Watford the most interested party in any such development.It hardly counts as a shock that football can be complicated, its intricate possibilities and permutations are normally what keep fans going between matches. What has never been fully appreciated before is the level of complication the absence of matches would bring."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/101846dcb4d1599fd14a421c040b692ec3c9631f/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8a0fd4f1344cd1adcc17474d112113c","title":"calling her lifts my spirits three parents on isolation away from their children","story":"As the UK remains in lockdown, parents share their stories about how they’re connecting with their children via technology …With much of the world in lockdown, staying connected with our loved ones has never been more important. Whether we’re checking in with a call, keeping ourselves entertained by taking part in online pub quizzes, or updating the family WhatsApp with our latest baking attempts, we have a burning desire to keep in touch. Our home broadband has gone from “nice to have” to the lifeline between us and the outside world.For some mums and dads who find themselves self-isolating away from their young children, this lifeline is critical. Here, three parents describe how they are managing to stay connected with their families from afar …Rosie: ‘I haven’t seen my son in four weeks’ “Dropping my son off with his father without knowing when I’m going to see him again was the most impossible thing I’ve ever had to do. And that feeling hasn’t lessened over all these weeks of self-isolation. My son is only three years old he’s so young. I feel ready to run out of here and scoop him up at any moment – to hell with it all.“I have to remind myself constantly why I have to take self-isolation so seriously. I’ve got bad asthma. So when my doctor advised that I stay indoors for 12 weeks, I decided it would be best for my son if he was with his dad, who has lots of outdoor space. We broke up in October, so I was only just getting used to the separation. And now this.“It’s been four weeks already, which is the longest I’ve ever been away from my son. FaceTime is essential, but it can be incredibly painful as well – I have to be positive because naturally I just want to burst into tears. I call him on my laptop as it has a bigger screen and his face is the normal size. At the end of the conversation he’ll hug the phone he’s using.“He recently showed me that he can now put his own socks on and told me that he’s being ‘independent’. He’s learned quite a few new words – I’m really proud of him. He’s also been collecting sticks and stones as presents for me when we’re reunited.“We talk at breakfast and dinner – it’s like how we used to sit around the family table, and he finds it entertaining to try to feed me bits of his food through the camera.“We’ve also had some family group calls – we had a lovely one with my sister and her son, my ex-husband and my son, and my dad and my stepmum. My son was playing the keyboard, and his cousin, who has just turned two, was dancing. It was so good!”Leo: ‘I had to isolate away from my daughter when I became ill’“When I started to feel ill a few weeks ago, with what I assume was coronavirus, my 12-year-old daughter was with her mum so it was easy for me to self-isolate.“As the illness took hold, I could do nothing but be in my bed. One bright part of the day, though, was FaceTiming my daughter, which isn’t something we did much previously. My ex and I share equal custody, so I’m used to seeing her every few days.“We’ve WhatsApped each other a lot, too. That way I got to check she was OK, what she was up to and, of course, my knowledge of emojis became fairly impressive.“My symptoms are now subsiding, but we feel it’s best that she stays at her mum’s until I’m completely clear, so the video calls have been such a help. We don’t have to talk every day, but knowing I can see her lifts my spirits. The distinctive sound of the FaceTime ringtone, and then seeing her face and that she looks so well, and isn’t bored or scared, makes this all much easier for me.“It has been very hard to be away from her especially because we don’t know when this is going to end. Several years ago I went to Brazil to work for a few weeks, but this will be the longest I haven’t been with my daughter. I know she is OK, though, and I know that right now she is in the best place with her fantastic mum, and in a wonderful home.“Loneliness, of course, comes into it, but weirdly with everyone in the same boat, you can sort of move away from thoughts of pure isolation. Knowing my daughter is only a video call away helps me so much.“We chat about what we’re doing, laugh about how mad we’re going, and I can put her mind at rest about any questions she has right now. We give each other a kiss on the camera, but we can also just sit in relative silence. She is painting a lot and during one call when I was ill and quite weak, she just got on with that while I watched and relaxed. That was lovely.”Mark: ‘We haven’t told my daughter I’m back in the UK yet’“I travel a lot for work and had recently spent a month in New Zealand away from my family – but when it began to look like everything was shutting down I decided to catch a flight back to the UK so I wouldn’t be stranded.“After discussing it with my wife, we decided that it would be best if I didn’t come straight back to the family home and – as a precaution – I would spend two weeks in isolation. I was very lucky that a good friend had moved in with his girlfriend during lockdown and he kindly offered me his flat to stay in.“However, this meant telling my little girl, who is seven years old, that I was still away. Although she doesn’t totally understand everything about what is going on, she knows enough that she’s been scared of things she’s heard on the news and fearful of us getting ill. So my wife and I decided we didn’t want to worry her even more.“Every day I FaceTime her as I normally would when I’m away, and it’s been a real lifeline for me to be able to see how she’s coping and reassure her that I’ll be home soon. We even watched a film together and her mum made her popcorn just like when we have family movie nights. Doing my best to pretend that everything is normal is the right thing for her, and it helps me cope with this awful situation too.“It’s really difficult to be away from my wife and daughter, especially when this is the time you want to be close to the people you love most in the world. Hopefully one day, when this is all over, we’ll be able to laugh together about how Daddy was hiding in a flat around the corner when she thought I was calling from New Zealand.”Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWe know that now, more than ever, it is important for you to stay connected to your family.That’s why every day, we at Vodafone are working hard to maintain our network.

Blankly staring at the forks in your cutlery drawer wondering why they have four prongs and not three.Instead, the past few weeks have shown that being shut away could be making us more connected with each other.

The argument that was put, that we don’t want to confuse the message, I think is just wrong. It underestimates the public. The public understand that there are phases to this.”Davis also called for the data underpinning the government’s strategy to be made public.Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said on Saturday that the government should respect that the British people were “capable of recognising what they need to do in lockdown”.He said the government needed to “bring the British people into its confidence”, and that the public had “already shown a remarkable level of common sense”.He also accused the government of treating people “like children” by refusing to discuss exit strategies.“The government is going to have to accept and admit we are coming out of lockdown. We need to trust the British people and not treat them like children,” he told the Times. “We must respect their common sense. They need to know that the sun is rising at some point, in an economic sense.”Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the Commons defence select committee, said that the best way to ensure public cooperation with the government was to keep people informed. He said a “general road map” spelling out the lockdown measures, but without a timetable of how they would progress, would be “well received” by the nation.“What we need is strategic clarity as to what happens next, and that’s what I’m calling for,” he said.“My concern has been that there has been a clarion call for an exit strategy when the government must make clear there is no exit from this until a vaccine is procured and delivered to a sizeable proportion of the population, therefore the longevity of this needs to be managed.”“Letting the nation know what is coming round the corner helps keep minds focused and people on board,” he added.Ellwood admitted that the prime minister’s absence had been a “real setback” in communication with the public, describing Boris Johnson as “the best communicator in government”.The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, also blamed the government’s lack of information on the end of lockdown on  Johnson’s absence, a claim which the spokesperson for the prime minister said was “just wrong”.A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “The government has already set out five clear tests to consider before making any adjustment to its approach.“At all times we have been consistently guided by scientific advice to protect lives. The current advice from Sage is that relaxing any of the measures could risk damage to public health, our economy, and the sacrifices we have all made.“Only when the evidence suggests that it is safe to do, and the scientific advice provides for it, will we adjust these measures.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/933f9e370a87924c8ab4f5085291a1c54265469d/0_79_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7d58967c95ee0b721ad6d6583eda679","title":"international space station crew return to earth","story":"American and Russian crew touch down in Kazakhstan after months on International Space StationThe three-person crew of the International Space Station returned to Earth on Friday morning, arriving back to a world that has been radically transformed by coronavirus in the time they were away.Space travel is often a journey into the unknown, but for Americans Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan, and Russian Oleg Skripochka, their return to Earth may bring more surprises than the time they spent in orbit. The trio’s landing capsule touched down on the Kazakh steppe in the early hours of the morning.Morgan had been at the ISS for nine months, his first space mission, while Meir and Skripochka blasted off six months ago, back when shaking hands and hugs were still normal greetings, international travel was routine and there was not even a hint of the virus that would emerge in Wuhan and make its way around the globe.The trio got an early hint of the new world they had arrived in as they were met by a recovery crew wearing face masks and rubber gloves, who pulled them out of their landing capsule. Russian officials said the team assigned to aid the crew had been under medical observation for a month, including tests for coronavirus. It was also cut to a minimum of essential personnel.“Please keep your distance,” one ground crew member could be heard telling another, in footage released by Russia’s space agency.Following the medical checkup, the crew boarded helicopters to Baikonur, the Russian launch site in the Kazakh steppe. From there, Skripochka will travel to Moscow. Morgan and Meir had a longer journey ahead of them: a nearly 200-mile drive to the city of Kyzylorda, and from there a flight back to the US. A closer airport has been closed to international flights due to the coronavirus. “It’s a little bit difficult for us to feel like we’re truly going back to a different planet,” Meir said in a television interview conducted when she was still aboard the ISS earlier this week.“We were really the only three humans that were not subject to that at the current time. Billions of humans were dealing with this in some way or another and the three of us weren’t.”Isolation and quarantine is not likely to be too challenging for the crew, who are used to the long months aboard the ISS. Meir said the best tips for surviving long periods of isolation were ensuring daily exercise, keeping a regular schedule, treating those around with kindness and making sure to have fun.On Thursday, Russian officials reported the first case of coronavirus at Star City, the complex outside Moscow which serves as the control room and training hub for space flights. The director of Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, said on Wednesday that there were currently 30 cases of coronavirus among employees.Even minor illnesses can be disastrous in space, with the Apollo 7 mission in 1968 severely hampered when one of those on board developed a cold soon after blastoff and quickly passed it to the others. For this reason, crews undergo a rigorous quarantine procedure for a month prior to departure.Due to coronavirus, these procedures were made even stricter than usual for the new crew at the ISS, who blasted off from Baikonur last week. As well as daily medical checks, all living spaces were regularly chemically cleaned. The launch took place without the usual fanfare and guest attendances.Astronauts Chris Cassidy, from the US, and Russians Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner will spend six months on the ISS. Before blastoff, Cassidy said part of him was pleased to be leaving Earth at the most uncertain time in a generation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06462836b9948633a581926ed7a7566181ca7d9e/0_161_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17d4538235dd894a3e4b423c084ffcea","title":"mediterranean shipwrecks reveal birth of globalisation in trade","story":"Preserved cargoes of vessels linking eastern cultures with western Europe show ‘the barbarian Orient’ was a trendsetter For almost seven decades archaeologists have searched the eastern Mediterranean in vain for wrecks that sank along antiquity’s mighty shipping lanes.Now, though, a British-led team can reveal a spectacular discovery – a fleet of Hellenistic, Roman, early Islamic and Ottoman wrecks that were lost some two kilometres below the waves of the Levantine Basin between the 3rd century BC and the 19th century.Sean Kingsley, director of the Centre for East-West Maritime Exploration and archaeologist for the Enigma Shipwrecks Project (ESP), told the Observer: “This is truly ground-breaking, one the most incredible discoveries under the Mediterranean.”The ESP’s ambitious underwater exploration used cutting-edge remote and robotic technology to research and record the finds, some of which could rewrite history, according to the experts involved.One of the wrecks is a 17th-century Ottoman merchant ship, described as “an absolute colossus”, which was so big two normal-sized ships could have fitted on its deck. Its vast cargo has hundreds of artefacts from 14 cultures and civilisations, including the earliest Chinese porcelain retrieved from a Mediterranean wreck, painted jugs from Italy and peppercorns from India. ESP say the ship reveals a previously unknown maritime silk and spice route running from China to Persia, the Red Sea and into the eastern Mediterranean.The ship, which is thought to have sunk around 1630, while sailing between Egypt and Istanbul, is a time-capsule that tells the story of the beginning of the globalised world, Kingsley said: “The goods and belongings of the 14 cultures and civilisations discovered, ning on one side of the globe China, India, the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, and to the west North Africa, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Belgium, are remarkably cosmopolitan for pre-modern shipping of any era.”He added: “At 43 metres long and with a 1,000-ton burden, it is one of the most spectacular examples of maritime technology and trade in any ocean. Its size is matched by the breadth of its cargoes.”The Chinese porcelain includes 360 decorated cups, dishes and a bottle made in the kilns of Jingdezhen during the reign of Chongzhen, the last Ming emperor that were designed for sipping tea, but the Ottomans adapted them for the craze then spreading across the East – coffee drinking. Hidden deep in the hold were the earliest Ottoman clay tobacco pipes found on land or sea. They were probably illicit because there were severe prohibitions then against tobacco smoking.Kingsley said: “Through tobacco smoking and coffee drinking in Ottoman cafes, the idea of recreation and polite society – hallmarks of modern culture – came to life. Europe may think it invented notions of civility, but the wrecked coffee cups and pots prove the ‘barbarian Orient’ was a trailblazer rather than a backwater. The first London coffeehouse only opened its doors in 1652, a century after the Levant.”Steven Vallery, co-director of Enigma, said: “In the Levantine Basin, the Enigma wrecks lie beyond any country’s territory. All the remains were carefully recorded using a suite of digital photography, HD video, photomosaics and multibeams. For science and underwater exploration, these finds are a giant leap forward.”The last phase of Enigma’s fieldwork was carried out at the end of 2015, with the post-excavation process continuing for years after and remaining unpublicised until now. Some of the recovered artefacts are being held in Cyprus, from where the archaeologists worked. Initial concerns that the site was in Cypriot waters have been disproved, Kingsley said, and the Enigma team now hopes the entire collection will go on permanent exhibition in a major public museum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12f38c31eaf1bce655181d2b0adc8768a36d0840/0_157_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcb8f9d6e89eb85f229050c6faab5cec","title":"tell us how is life in lockdown affecting your gambling","story":"Are you gambling less?

This commitment needs to be rock solid and consistent so councils can stay focused on leading the local response to the greatest challenge we have faced as a nation for decades.”However, council sources were clear that this may not be the last time the government would need to intervene to stabilise council finances as the costs of social care, personal protective equipment, housing rough sleepers and providing support to vulnerable “shielded” residents continue to mount.Cllr David Williams, the chairman of the County Councils Network, said: “We do not know how long the outbreak will last for, so the financial situation for councils must be kept under review, alongside a commitment to underwrite lost income from council tax.“Coronavirus poses both short- and long-term challenges for our places. It is clear that councils will have a huge role to play in helping our communities and businesses back on to their feet, but we will need to be adequately resourced to do so.”Rob Whiteman, the chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, said: “Today’s welcome news is a step in the right direction but more will be needed to ensure councils can maintain services in areas such as adult social care, homelessness and for other vulnerable groups.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7458863d8893748028afd9e88f0ab6af3c37e7b2/0_311_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3a3ff4dbe4c23b7c1f503ce634034bc","title":"coronavirus vaccine trials could be completed by mid august","story":"UK taskforce comment comes amid mounting pressure to provide PPE to health workersTrials for a Covid-19 vaccine could be completed by mid-August, a key adviser to the government has said.John Bell, a member of the government’s coronavirus vaccine taskforce, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that human test trials had begun at Oxford University this week.But Bell emphasised that “the real question” was not when the vaccine would become available, but whether it would be effective.“But if things go on course and it does have efficacy, then I think it is reasonable to think that they would be able to complete their trial by mid-August.”Bell said a candidate vaccine being tested at Oxford had gone “into man” for the first time on Thursday, after a wide range of safety studies.“If we can see evidence of a strong immune response by the middle or the end of May, then I think the game is on,” he said, adding that the next step would then be “the massive issue of how you manufacture at scale many billions of doses”.The comments came amid mounting pressure on the government to provide personal protective equipment (PPE) to frontline staff in hospitals and care homes, after it emerged that NHS bosses have asked doctors and nurses to work without protective full-length gowns when treating Covid-19 patients.Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, said some trusts will run out of supplies on Saturday or Sunday, because the national stock of fully fluid-repellent gowns and coveralls was now exhausted.On Friday, the business secretary, Alok Sharma, announced details of cash grants for research into vaccines and potential treatments, among them an antibody drug, which the government hopes could be given regularly to healthcare workers and other high-risk groups to provide protection over a few weeks or months.A British Medical Association survey of more than 6,000 doctors across the country found a significant number do not have the protection needed to guard against Covid-19.The BMA council chairman, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, said: “The government says that 1bn items will soon have been shipped, and while there have been signs of improvement, our research clearly shows that equipment is not reaching all doctors working on the frontline.“Too many doctors and healthcare staff have already lost their lives. We cannot afford to risk losing any more. Just yesterday the health and social care secretary said he could not guarantee that hospitals would not run out this weekend,” Nagpaul added.At least 56 NHS workers have died from coronavirus. The actual number of health workers to have lost their lives is likely to be higher, as not all deaths will be in the public domain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a0ea3d2438a372d223ad8a44b45ea2c215c78da/0_76_2229_1338/master/2229.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94f4e63cbf57f548e5ec23efd546dd3f","title":"derby and oaks slated for july in bha provisional resumption plans","story":"The British Horseracing Authority has set early June as a provisional “best-case” starting point for the 2020 Classics, should an easing of lockdown restrictions allow racing to resume behind closed doors within the next few weeks. If it proves possible to run the 1,000 Guineas and 2,000 Guineas around the time when the Derby would normally take place, then both the Derby and the Oaks would be staged in early July.The “best-case” scenario, which the BHA stresses is wholly dependent on a relaxation of the current rules on gatherings, is set out in a letter to Britain’s 600 licensed trainers, which gives more details about the Authority’s plans for a revised fixture list with a reduced number of meetings when racing can finally resume.The letter acknowledges that “not all racecourses will be able to race behind closed doors or meet specific criteria around risk mitigation” and that “with no income from crowds and betting shops potentially still closed, there will be greater reliance on the Levy Board for prize money”. This will “both limit the fixtures we can afford to stage, and also inevitably impact on prize money values”.If the Derby and Oaks can be staged in early July – with Newmarket thought to be a likely venue since Epsom, which is on public land, is unlikely to be able to race behind closed doors – then some Group One events for older horses “may be required to be moved to a slightly different date”. Some events may also be closed to three-year-olds “if their proximity to a key three-year-old event is closer than ideal”. This could affect races such as the Eclipse Stakes, which is normally staged in early July.Royal Ascot is, at present, slated for its traditional slot in mid-June, though the course has already said that if the meeting goes ahead, it will do so behind closed doors. If so, the BHA says that it will be “looking to stage several key Classic trials, and other trial races feeding into Royal Ascot, during the second half of May,” while stressing that “a later restart would require these plans to be adjusted accordingly”.Away from the sport’s major events, the BHA will “aim to keep things as close to normal as possible, with a standard mix of handicaps and weight-for-age races for all horses.” In the early stage of any resumption, however, the Authority anticipates that “field sizes will need to be restricted to support the logistics of social distancing on a raceday and to minimise the risk of incidents”. It is also possible that “for a while we will avoid races for apprentices”.Jumping fans, meanwhile, will be encouraged to hear that the current suspension of National Hunt racing until 1 July could be followed by “a jumping programme largely based on the original programme book”. The letter adds that jumps trainers “are currently being asked for details of the horses they expect to have ready to run at that time so that appropriate revisions to the programme can be made.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a84a58339c8111e7823c1d2ef064943f2e0bef29/0_257_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=baf8fe4631af19f722d6c109667b329d","title":"hottest front room seats the best theatre and dance to watch online","story":"From live-streams of new plays to classics from the archive, here are some of the top shows online now or coming soon – this page is updated dailyHampstead theatre and the  have teamed up to stream a series of acclaimed productions for free.

The production comprises Rough for Theatre I, Rockaby, Neither, Come and Go and Act Without Words II. Feel the rising panic and despair in Rockaby as the solitary, wide-eyed Hunter recounts a descent through long, lonely days.Even by Pina Bausch’s standards it’s an arresting opening: a huge wall collapses on stage and across the rubble comes Julie Shanahan, in high heels and a floral frock. After desperately commanding hugs from two suitors, she takes a seat and is pelted with rotten tomatoes. And so begins an epic patchwork of masochistic rituals, nightmares and games, blending the quotidian with the phenomenal, all inspired by the choreographer’s trip to Sicily. A rare chance to watch one of Bausch’s creations in full and for free online.At first sight they could be Pina Bausch’s dancers: a procession of performers wearing smart suits and enigmatic smiles, gliding across a stage filled with apples. Bausch’s company memorably balanced apples on their heads in Palermo Palermo, but as Smashed is created by those juggling supremos Gandini, the fruit is mostly in motion here. Their Bausch homage has the same childlike games, adult fantasy and bruised humour of the German choreographer’s work. Smashed is crisp, fresh and full of flavour. You may never look at an apple in the same way again …All four productions in Classic Spring’s starry Oscar Wilde season in the West End can be watched on the online service Marquee TV, which is offering a 14-day free trial.

Alternately rousing and yearning, this is a gorgeous hymn to barflies, precious memories and the joys of being a ghost, told with a dash of Edgar Allan Poe and Thelonious Monk. It’s a glorious get-together of a show, as warming as the whiskey handed out to the audience – but you’ll have to pour your own I’m afraid.Open Clasp is a women’s theatre company aiming to “change the world, one play at a time”. Key Change, now available to stream online, is a fantastic introduction to their consistently impressive work with women who are on the margins of society in this case, prisoners at HM Prison Low Newton, who devised the 2015 show with the theatre group over several months in order to break down stigma and enlighten audiences. It was filmed in partnership with The Space.Created for children aged three to seven by Rochdale’s touring theatre company, M6, this sweetly magical show is centred on an alpine weather house whose little male and female figures each pop outdoors depending on the weather (rain for him, sun for her). When the couple start to look after a nest of birds, Gilly Baskeyfield’s story and her jaunty production gently explore themes of family and shared responsibilities.

In his annual letter to shareholders on Thursday, Bezos said Amazon had assembled a team of scientists and software engineers to build internal testing capacity, and hoped to build its own testing laboratory soon.“Regular testing on a global scale, across all industries, would both help keep people safe and help get the economy back up and running. For this to work, we as a society would need vastly more testing capacity than is currently available,” he said.Amazon is also rapidly hiring staff to keep up with demand from shoppers. The company said on Monday it was hiring an extra 75,000 staff to help it to process the increase in orders. Those new recruits come on top of 100,000 taken on already since the coronavirus crisis hit western economies last month. The additional workers will take Amazon’s global workforce to nearly 1 million.Joshua Warner, an analyst at the London-based online trading firm IG Index, said: “Amazon shines from all angles during the coronavirus crisis. Ultimately, Amazon will remain one of the most important businesses during this crisis, providing key services including food, entertainment and shopping at a time when consumers have fewer retailers to choose from.“Amazon stock has rocketed to a new record high,” he added. “Of all the firms that might stand to benefit, Amazon is a clear winner.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70cee8883d2b3764620cf1602e02f13c8c907ff4/375_0_5625_3376/master/5625.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=567c4ea02af4685e1ec0828f30853fba","title":"hope high radio 5 live review huddersfield gangs the essay rachel cooke single women radio 3","story":"A brilliant BBC investigation into teens, knives and county lines makes for a gripping listenHere are a couple of interesting non-virus series to remind us of our old interconnected world, where people lived all tangled up with one another and what happened when they did.Hope High is an excellent documentary podcast about teenagers in Huddersfield who have been groomed into working for gangs. Reporter, producer and presenter Annabel Deas usually works as a news producer for 5 Live but, “frustrated by the endless news reports about a child carrying a knife ‘being in a gang’ – as if that was an explanation” – she spent a year in West Yorkshire, talking to children who carry knives and those who care for them.In the first episode she goes into the school that some of the teenagers attend: North Huddersfield Trust. It’s clearly a brilliant school that goes the extra mile: the head spends hours on the phone to social services, trying to get help for her pupils. Soon we meet the grandmother of one of the boys, Aaron, who is in such peril that he had to be taken to Jamaica for a while to get out of danger. Now he’s back, he can’t stay at his mum’s, for fear of gang repercussions. He goes into care. Social services say that he and his family could move to Manchester, for their own safety, but don’t help them to do so.We meet other children: Josh, Daniel, Steven. All around them there is violence. Knifings on their street. Gunshots, but the shooting isn’t reported. Dangerous people move into their homes. We don’t often hear the children talk, which could make Hope High a little frustrating, but Deas’s hard work and skilled storytelling brings their tales to life. She is direct, visceral – I loved her vivid description of one of the boys eating a McDonald’s – and she makes you understand. The authorities, according to all the parents, don’t get involved enough. The police don’t prosecute children for having a knife, or carrying a small amount of cocaine, or trying to beat up their mum, because they don’t want to criminalise young people. The result? Teenagers think they can get away with it. And social services seem… well, let’s call it distracted, to be charitable.One 14-year-old got involved in county lines dealing. He went missing for three weeks. “Social services were onboard,” says his mum. “I were updating them with any information they needed... they were saying they had a plan, for when he’s caught. But when he came back, they did nothing. Diddly squat.” There was a pattern to her son’s behaviour: she informed the police, reported him as a missing person. She wanted him to be arrested, moved, taken away from her, anything to change his behaviour. But the authorities sat on their hands. Eventually, her son was arrested for a violent assault and sentenced to five years. When he comes out, his childhood will be over.Somewhat frustratingly, Hope High appears to have dropped off BBC Sounds’ podcast recommendations. Perhaps this sort of story seems irrelevant when nobody is going out. But police have said that even now, many young people are still being made to cross county lines to deliver drugs. This grooming is not stopping.Just room to mention Radio 3’s The Essay. Last week it was on the brilliantly interesting topic of single women – written and presented by my fellow Observer writer Rachel Cooke. Cooke is wonderfully well read, but wears her knowledge lightly and with style. In her first essay, she explains that the word “spinster” comes from “spinner”: an unwed woman, orphan or widow who worked with cotton and wool in the family home. Cooke makes the case for replacing “spinster” with “the odd woman”, which I love. She also covers career girls, the orcee, widows and aunts – all fabulous categories of woman, and Cooke clearly enjoys celebrating each one. They are single, but involved in the world. Alone, but far from lonely. Sounds delightful.Locked TogetherAudible UK Audible makes great audio (podcasts and audio books), which you usually have to pay for. But earlier this month it launched Audible Stories, making hundreds of audiobooks available for free, to help keep kids and young adults entertained during these quiet times.

Cheering.Absolute Radio’s mental health driveAbsolute Radio, and all its various “decade” stations (Absolute Radio 60s, 90s etc), gives a lot of bang for its buck. On the evening of bank holiday Monday, on the main Absolute station, it staged a resourceful and lovely Front Room festival, with various bands playing tracks live from their homes (here’s Kodaline). Plus, every station is promoting mental health awareness throughout this tricky time, while there’s a series of shows, Time to Listen, which explores music’s positive impact by getting musicians to talk about tracks that have helped them.

Over recent years, programmes have moved away from “stand and stir” and are now an excellent excuse for all manner of science, cultural history, humour, escapism and pure entertainment.I love a tight 27 minutes on thrifty ways with mince as much as the next food nerd but, with everyone else gone to bed and everything else going to hell, it’s always going to be me and Anthony Bourdain. I love the early stuff such as A Cook’s Tour (2002-3, Food NetworkAmazon Prime) which see him reeling around Ho Chi Minh City, dressed like Joe Strummer and jabbering into a lo-fi, hand-held video camera. But there is so much more to choose from. No Reservations (2005-12,Travel ChannelAmazon Prime) allowed Bourdain nine seasons to develop his compelling combination of chill and total engagement with his subject. By around season four, any idea of “celebrity chef” is subsumed in a search for challenging locations, fascinating and underrepresented people and increasingly honest examinations of his own flawed past. Parts Unknown (2013-18, CNNAmazon Prime) contains my two favourite episodes. New Jersey (season 5, episode 6) is an elegiac film that sees him visiting his childhood home with his brother, and in Rome (season 8, episode 9) he is guided around the city by Asia Argento, with whom he later formed a relationship.Did you enjoy This Is Spinal Tap or the The Life of Rock with Brian Pern? The comedy of spoof “rockumentary” lies in the uncalibrated self-regard of the subjects and the breathless complicity of the film-maker, so you’re going to love Chef’s Table. From the bombastic Vivaldi over the titles to the shots of Dan Barber, running while philosophising, or Francis Mallmann on his private island, hewing logs and talking about the creative power of sex, it’s difficult to imagine that the first series wasn’t all an expensively executed troll. But that was back in 2015, when we wanted our chefs to be artistgodsrockstars of their generation and American documentary-makers still had little enough irony to support the idea.As the series progressed they began to profile more female chefs and some of the resulting shows are outstanding. Jeong Kwan, cooking at the Chunjinam Hermitage in South Korea is therapeutic to watch, Cristina Martinez at the South Philly Barbacoa and Mashama Bailey at The Grey in Savannah, Georgia are inspiring, and our own Asma Khan is given space to properly expand on Indian food in the UK. Someone, somewhere turned down the ego dial.PBS, 2012-2017 – season 6 on FacebookTakes a similarly hagiographic approach as Chef’s Table but allows each featured chef more space to cook. Gabrielle Hamilton – troubled, driven, phenomenally talented – comes across particularly well. It’s probably to her credit that our own April Bloomfield actually looks uncomfortable throughout her episodes, awkwardly attempting Delia-esque presentation while the directors try to extract some sort of life philosophy or grandiose soundbite out of her. It’s actually charming and should make us proud.Carlos Perez Osorio’s show will make you believe that there might actually be a future for intelligent food programmes on TV. Each of the six half-hour episodes covers a different type of taco in obsessive depth. The show is in Spanish and subtitled, a serious deep e into the subject, but delivered with a brilliant tone – fantastically, poetically hyperbolic about street food, enthusiastic but self-aware.BBC iPlayer is a positive treasure vault of old favourites, offering a great deal of Keith Floyd’s unhinged, plonk-fuelled pan-rattling and Ken Hom’s masterful Chinese Cooking. They are welcome old friends but favourite must be Jaffrey’s six-part series on regional Indian cooking. Her on-camera persona is calm, dignified and utterly no-nonsense, presenting challengingly authentic recipes in the most authoritative manner. If you think this sounds a bit too worthily BBC2 … check out her debut as a rapper in a YouTube video by Brooklyn MC, Mr Cardamom.Netflix, 2019 to presentJon Favreau is a producer and actor who starred in the movie Chef, with his chef mate Roy Choi, and quite fancies himself as a chef. In The Chef Show (see what he did there?), they hang out in the borrowed kitchens of their Hollywood buddies. It has about as much script or editorial control as a podcast, but with full quality video. What is most noticeable is that there’s no attempt to give recipes … in fact, all the ingredients seem to arrive pre-prepped and measured in tiny plastic pots. I want to hate the OG bro-fest format, but it’s actually compelling if you relax into it.The next time you’re down the YouTube rabbit hole, seek out Julia Child. Like an American Fanny Cradock but infinitely nicer, she taught a nation to love French cuisine. There are loads of clips and some full episodes of her PBS cooking shows, which are an innocent treat and from which you’ll still pick up helpful recipes and tips. Childs collaborated with French chef Jacques Pepin who also had his own programmes concentrating on technique. The clips available on YouTube are still some of the most instructive out there. By far the most important one covers boning a chicken for a ballotine which is cult viewing among chefs.A feature-length documentary about the man who managed to arrive in San Francisco just in time to be a driving force in California cuisine. His rise from untrained kitchen boy at Chez Panisse to the very peak of his industry, his acclaimed restaurant, Stars, and his catastrophic crash-and-burn makes for a brilliant, unflinching profile.Samin Nosrat is another graduate of Chez Panisse whose highly successful 2017 book Salt, Fat, Acid Heat was quickly turned into a four-part docuseries. The book’s simple idea of breaking cooking down into four conceptual basics enables her to travel the world in search of examples. Like our own Nadiya Hussain, she’s a natural presenter whose integrity and enthusiasm draws you in.Presented by culinary wunderkind David Chang of the celebrated Momofuku restaurant group. There are parts of the early shows that are big on chest-beating, high-fiving, alpha-malery, but in the most recent he turns to important cultural issues around global cooking. He also discovers he’s going to become a dad, sheds an actual tear, and then teaches us all how to make baby food. OK, it’s a kind of predictable conversion but, if you start watching them in reverse order, they’re very enjoyable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0fca2674d6d927929b068326a4a6269151e8eed/0_326_5181_3110/master/5181.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=326c15a99f80ec70758a8d200d909430","title":"gulf coast deepwater horizon oil industry louisiana","story":"The Deepwater Horizon devastated the ecology and economy from Texas to Florida but BP-funded recovery programs are ongoing and the sector is a big employerWhen the explosion ripped through the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, Leo Linder was standing in his living quarters in his underwear. He suddenly found himself facing a fellow rig worker in what had been a separate room because the force of the explosion had blown the walls away.Linder wasn’t to know it at the time but the blast was to trigger the worst environment disaster in US history, with the BP operation spewing more than 4.9m barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico, fouling hundreds of miles of shoreline from Texas to Florida, decimating wildlife and crippling local fishing and tourism industries.The spill also had a human cost, with 11 workers dying in the disaster. One of them, Gordon Jones, had relieved Linder around an hour before the explosion. “He said, ‘What the hell are you doing, go home,’” Linder said. “In many ways he saved my life. The guilt from surviving, as well as the damage done, still gnaws at me. It kills me.”The recovery has been patchy, with some businesses unable to recover and some people forced to move away.“It was a bit like a bad dream,” said Albertine Kimble, a retiree who has spent the past two decades in Carlisle, a small town south of New Orleans. “It was impending doom, it affected the fisheries and the birds. It was even more depressing than Hurricane Katrina and that flooded my house.”Kimble has had to raise her house twice on stilts due to the threat of flooding in an area prone to storms and coastal erosion accelerated by the climate crisis. The process has also been worsened by the oil and gas industry’s practice of forging canals through wetlands, which has introduced corrosive salt water. The nearby town of Pointe à la Hache was turned into a “ghost town” as fishing opportunities vanished, Kimble said.“It was a bit like the coronavirus, just dead,” she said. “I don’t think it’s recovered, to tell you the truth.”The fishing industry is a major constituent of life in southern Louisiana and shutting down the ability to catch fish, oysters and shrimp was a major blow to communities. Many of the fishermen and women used their boats to help the clean-up effort by deploying booms and spreading oil dispersant.Even after the Gulf was declared safe to fish in again, crews initially reported pulling in smaller catches of oddly deformed fish with oozing sores. Dolphins started dying in record numbers, tuna and amberjack developed deformities to their heart and other organs. Scientists have also found lingering problems within the web of marine life.Recent research by the University of Florida found the richness of species in the Gulf has declined by more than a third due to direct and indirect impacts of the spill. A separate study of 2,500 inidual fish from 91 species by the University of South Florida found oil exposure in all of them.Many of the species are popular types of seafood. The extent of the exposure has startled researchers.“We were quite surprised that among the most contaminated species was the fast-swimming yellowfin tuna as they are not found at the bottom of the ocean where most oil pollution in the Gulf occurs,” said lead author Erin Pulster, a researcher at the university’s college of marine science.“It was an entire Gulf of Mexico-wide event,” said Tracey Sutton, a marine scientist at Nova Southeastern University. told Oceana. “Nobody was ready for this scale of pollution. As far as we know, the actual impact of the spill is not over yet.”Deepwater Horizon exploded 40 miles off the coast and shot out oil that proved devilishly difficult to clean from the nooks and crannies of Louisiana’s marshland. An initial attempt to cap the spill was unsuccessful, necessitating the drilling of a secondary relief well to stem the flow. It took four months to completely stop the gushing oil.In all, BP paid out about $65n in compensation, legal fees and clean-up costs, which includes billions for affected states. A judge ruled the petrochemical giant was “grossly negligent” in the lead-up to the disaster. Subcontractors Transocean and Halliburton were “negligent”, the judge said.The payment of the compensation money adds to the complex relationship states like Louisiana, which bore the brunt of the spill, have with the oil industry. The industry caused an environmental and societal catastrophe along the coast and is contributing towards the climate crisis that threatens more and more of the state with inundation each year.But the compensation paid has helped fund various coastal conservation projects and oil and gas remain major, and largely popular, employers in the region. Linder was only on Deepwater Horizon because the pay was four times the $28,000 a year he was earning as an English teacher.“I don’t think anyone realized right off the bat we’d have this unprecedented natural disaster,” said Chip Kline, an assistant to Governor John Bel Edwards and chairman of the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA).“During the spill there were some intense moments with BP but in Louisiana we have an economy largely driven by oil and gas it employs a lot of Louisiana residents. We try to strike a balance.”A decade on, with an incomplete recovery, coastal Gulf communities face a Trump administration that is attempting to reverse many of the safety-based regulations imposed after the oil spill. Residents are hoping this won’t lead to a repeat.“It made me sick to the stomach thinking about all the oil out there in the beautiful Gulf of Mexico,” said Kimble. “I hope and pray to God it never happens again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/932a59f304fcdd8f09fff98cdc1ea35832d65ca8/0_106_7360_4414/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fa482ae489cd83fc78921bf26ca81d0b","title":"how has access to outside space impacted you during the lockdown","story":"We would like to know how your experience of lockdown in the UK has been shaped by your access to outdoor spaceWith lockdowns in place around the world, we know that the experience of staying indoors is very different depending on your access to outdoor space.We’d like to hear how your access to space has impacted you over the last three weeks.

About 2,000 people attend prayers each day. Volunteers cram into its kitchen to prepare iftar, the meal that breaks the Ramadan fast at sunset, for 300 people each night.Not this year. “We will miss all that,” said Mohammed Kozbar, the mosque’s general secretary. The building’s gates are locked, with only security guards patrolling its prayer halls and community spaces. “I visited last week. It was heartbreaking to see it empty and silent,” said Kozbar.The world’s 1.8bn Muslims are facing the most important period of the Islamic year, the holy month of Ramadan, which starts this week, under lockdown because of the global coronavirus pandemic.Mosques in most countries are shut and gatherings forbidden. The holy sites of Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia are under curfew. The al-Aqsa mosque and Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem’s Old City are closed and prayers suspended.In the UK, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) called for the suspension of all congregational activities at mosques and Islamic centres on 16 March, a week before the government announced all places of worship must close under the lockdown order.On Friday, the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board said Islamic buildings would remain closed during Ramadan until the lockdown is lifted. “It would be deemed extremely irresponsible to congregate for night prayers or hold religious gatherings during this Ramadan in any mosque or houses with people who are not members of the immediate household,” said Qari Asim, a Leeds imam and chair of the board.“During the epidemic, the desire to perform prayers with a congregation in a mosque comes second to saving lives.”For Muslims, to be unable to take part in congregational prayers and break the fast with family and friends during Ramadan was “emotionally challenging, frustrating and culturally alien”, he added.Shelina Janmohamed, the author of Generation M: Young Muslims Changing the World and vice-president of Islamic marketing at Ogilvy Consulting, said: “This is going to be the most unusual Ramadan of my lifetime and I think in the living memory of Muslims across the UK.”Like other faiths, Muslims are using technology to meet the challenges of lockdown. Ramadan prayers and the nightly recitation of the Qur’an will move online, and fundraising for charities will also be digital. Platforms such as Zoom are expected to host iftar parties.Guidance is being drawn up by Islamic scholars on exemptions from fasting for people who are vulnerable to coronavirus. Muslims working long shifts in essential services will “need to be pragmatic in their approach” to fasting, said Harun Khan, secretary general of the MCB.“This Ramadan will be at a slower pace. It will give us more time for reflection and the opportunity to be closer to God,” he said. Instead of visiting different mosques every day, Khan will be spending Ramadan at home with his immediate family.According to Asim: “There is likely to be a tiny group of zealous people who may try to organise iftar events or congregational night prayers in their homes. My message to them is that selfishness has no place with God.”He also warned that extreme rightwing groups were “trying to use the pandemic to create ision” and were scapegoating Muslims for the spread of the virus.At Finsbury Park mosque, there are plans to distribute iftar meals to people in need or alone who would normally come in person. “People who volunteer with us every Ramadan are calling to say, ‘Please, how can we help?’,” said Kozbar.The mosque will be streaming lectures and prayers, offering online counselling and organising members to take food to staff at nearby hospitals. “This lockdown is something new for us, like everyone else. It’s a very difficult time, but we want to do our bit.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/989613ffbb7cb026d8baaa4c374795ed2acd5dce/0_0_3777_2266/master/3777.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=291860a17e7326fb3df3818087be9aba","title":"coronavirus hundreds of britons stranded in bangladesh to be repatriated","story":"Government charters four flights to bring back 850 people paying £600 per ticketHundreds of Britons stranded in Bangladesh by the coronavirus lockdown are to return home after the UK government chartered four repatriation flights.The flights will return as many as 850 British citizens to the UK, with priority given to elderly people, those with underlying health conditions and others at risk of developing severe coronavirus symptoms.Tickets will cost £600, and are being part-funded by the government’s £75m scheme to organise repatriation flights from countries where commercial routes have shut down as a result of the pandemic.The flights would leave the capital, Dhaka, for London on 21, 23, 25 and 26 April, the Foreign Office said. Travellers would also be able to board transfer flights to the capital from Sylhet, in the the north-east of the country.Tariq Ahmad, the UK minister for South Asia and the Commonwealth, described the situation as unprecedented.“Foreign Office staff in the UK and Bangladesh have been working tirelessly with the Bangladeshi authorities to help British travellers who want to come back to the UK, and these flights mean people can now do that,” he said. “Our staff will continue to support those Britons who remain in Bangladesh throughout this crisis, and beyond.”Robert Chatterton Dickson, the British high commissioner to Bangladesh, said the commission in Dhaka would remain open and continue to provide assistance to British nationals.The repatriation flights are part of wider efforts to bring 7,000 Britons home from south Asia. The government had earlier announced 17 chartered flights from India and 10 from Pakistan, expected to bring home about 4,000 and 2,500 passengers respectively.More than 7,500 British nationals who do not usually reside in Pakistan have already returned to the UK from the country since the crisis began, according to the Foreign Office.Meanwhile, another repatriation flight will bring UK nationals back to Britain from Sierra Leone on Wednesday.British tourists, short-term visitors and their direct dependants in Sierra Leone will be able to book tickets for the special flight for £600 per person, but only those who are normally resident in the UK will be eligible to travel.The flight will leave Freetown airport on the evening of 22 April, arriving at Stansted in the early hours of 23 April.Passengers travelling from Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, must report to the Sea Coach terminal in the Aberdeen area of the city between 12pm and 3pm on Wednesday.About 5,000 people are or have been repatriated from India on 21 previously announced flights operating from 8-20 April. The FCO said it had so far repatriated more than 7,300 people on 35 flights from 13 countries.

He did not go into further details.Donald Trump, the US president, said Texas and Vermont will allow certain businesses to reopen on Monday while still observing coronavirus-related precautions, and Montana will begin lifting restrictions on Friday.Some state governors have warned that they will not act prematurely to reopen their economies until there is more testing for the virus, however. Business leaders have also told Trump the country needs to have widespread testing in place before their companies can return to normal operations.Turkey’s confirmed coronavirus cases have risen to 82,329, Fahrettin Koca, the country’s health minister, said. It has overtaken neighbouring Iran for the first time to register the highest total in the Middle East.An increase of 3,783 cases in the last 24 hours also pushed Turkey’s confirmed tally within a few hundred of China, where coronavirus first emerged.Koca said 121 more people have died, taking the death toll to 1,890.Morocco will extend lockdown measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus for another month until 20 May, the government said.The decision was made by the government council as the number of confirmed cases rose to 2,685, including 137 deaths and 314 recoveries.Lockdown conditions imposed on 20 March mean people are only allowed to go out to buy food or medicine and to staff some key jobs. Morocco has made wearing masks mandatory with those who fail to do so risking jail terms and fines.France registered 642 more deaths from coronavirus infections on Saturday, bringing the total to 19,323, the fourth-highest tally in the world, although the number of people in hospital declined for a fourth day running.France’s public health authority said the total number of people in intensive care units also fell for the 10th day in a row, to 5,833 – the lowest level since 31 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many cases are there near me","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

On testing, contact tracing and equipment supply, there was a failure to prepare By late December last year, doctors in the central Chinese city of Wuhan were starting to worry about patients quarantined in their hospitals suffering from an unusual type of pneumonia.As the mystery illness spread in one of China’s major industrial hubs, some tried to warn their colleagues to take extra care at work, because the disease resembled Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), the deadly respiratory disease that had killed hundreds of people across the region in 2002-03 after a government cover-up.One of those who tried to raise the alarm, though only among a few medical school classmates, was a 33-year-old Chinese ophthalmologist, Li Wenliang. Seven people were in isolation at his hospital, he said, and the disease appeared to be a coronavirus, from the same family as Sars.In early January he was called in by police, reprimanded for “spreading rumours online”, and forced to sign a paper acknowledging his “misdemeanour” and promising not to repeat it.Many early cases were linked to the city’s Huanan seafood and fresh produce market, which also sold wildlife, suggesting that the first cases were contracted there.Scientists would discover the disease had probably originated in bats and had then passed through a second species – in all likelihood, but not certainly, pangolins, a type of scaly anteater – before infecting humans.But the infections were soon spreading directly between patients, so fast that on 23 January the government announced an unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan city and the surrounding Hubei province.Two weeks later, on 7 February, Li, who had contracted coronavirus himself, died in hospital from the condition about which he had tried to raise the alarm. He had no known underlying conditions and left behind a wife and young child.Li became the face of the mysterious new disease. The story of his death and pictures of him in a hospital bed wearing an oxygen mask made media headlines across the globe, including in the UK.The world, it seemed, was slowly becoming more aware of how lethal coronavirus could be, that it was not just another form of flu with fairly mild symptoms.But while UK scientists and medical researchers were becoming more concerned, and studying the evidence from China, those among them who were most worried were not getting their messages through to high places.The Conservative government of Boris Johnson had other more immediate preoccupations at the start of this year.Johnson was still basking in his general election success last December. After he returned from a celebratory Caribbean holiday with his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, the political weather for the prime minister seemed to be set fair. It was honeymoon time.Three and a half years on from the Brexit referendum, the UK was finally about to leave the EU on 31 January. The fireworks and parties for the big night were being planned, the celebratory 50p coins minted.Minds were certainly not on a developing health emergency far away, as Johnson prepared to exploit the moment of the UK’s departure from the European Union for all it was worth. “I think there was some over-confidence,” admitted one very senior Tory last week.The prime minister and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, wanted to make an early impression at home in other ways too, as domestic reformers. Cummings was waging a war on civil servants in Whitehall, throwing his weight around and deliberately upsetting the Westminster applecart.While he made the headlines, briefing about his iconoclastic ambitions, Johnson was preparing a big Cabinet reshuffle to assert his own authority in other areas now Brexit was done and dusted.With Labour effectively leaderless after its fourth consecutive election defeat, there was little opposition to trouble Johnson on any front at all – and certainly no-one of note asking tough questions about coronavirus.The prime minister duly recast his cabinet team on 13 February – five days after Li’s death in Wuhan. He made big changes but unsurprisingly retained the hitherto safe pair of hands of Matt Hancock as his health secretary.In a sign of where priorities lay – and the lack of concern that a potential crisis might be heading our way from the east – Hancock wasted no time recording a video of himself grinning with delight on reshuffle day.He smacked his right fist into his left palm saying he could not wait to “get cracking” and that he relished the chance to deliver the Tories’ manifesto promises, reform social care and improve life sciences. And lastly, in a more sombre voice, he spoke of “dealing with coronavirus and keeping the public safe” before adding, as the grin returned: “Now let’s get back to work!”It is perhaps too early to conclude for sure that Johnson, Hancock and the government’s entire team of scientific and medical advisers were caught asleep at the wheel. But the fact that Johnson and Hancock themselves, in common with much of the Downing Street staff, would go on to contract the virus or suffer symptoms, further suggests that people at the top had not been sufficiently on their guard.Now, 11 weeks on from the first cases being confirmed in the UK on 31 January – a period during which more than 14,000 people (and probably several thousands more once care home fatalities are counted) in the UK have died from Covid-19 – and with the country in lockdown, the economy facing prolonged recession as a result, schools closed, and no sign of an end in sight – hard questions have to be asked.We already know with some certainty that other countries, such as Germany, South Korea, Taiwan and New Zealand, will emerge from this crisis having performed far better than the UK. A few weeks ago the government’s advisers crassly said that fewer than 20,000 deaths would be “a very good result” for the UK.As we fast approach that grim tally, many experts now believe the UK may come out of this crisis, whenever that may be, with one of the worst records on fighting coronavirus of any European nation. Once the full tally is counted, few expect the number of deaths to be below 20,000.By contrast, on Friday, Germany was saying it thought it had brought coronavirus largely under control. It had had 3,868 deaths, less a third of the total in the UK (and Germany’s population, at 83 million, is far higher), having conducted widespread testing for Covid-19 from early on, precisely as the UK has failed to do.How, then, did it come to this? How did coronavirus spread across the globe, prompting different responses in different countries? Did the UK simply fail to heed the warnings? Or did it just decide to take different decisions, while others settled on alternative actions to save lives?David Nabarro, professor of global health at Imperial College, London, and an envoy for the World Health Organization on Covid-19, says one thing is for sure. All governments were warned how serious the situation was likely to become as early as the end of January. Ignorance of the danger that was coming can be no excuse. Yet it would not be until late March – later than many other countries – that Johnson would announce a complete lockdown.“WHO had been following the outbreak since the end of December and within a few weeks it called a meeting of its emergency committee to decide if this outbreak was a ‘public health emergency of international concern’,” said Nabarro.“That is the highest level of alert that WHO can issue, and it issued it on January 30. It made it very clear then – to every country in the world – that we were facing something very serious indeed.”Well before the end of January, the WHO had been tracking the growing threat minutely: 14 January was a key day in the spread of the disease that would become known as Covid-19. The first case was confirmed outside China, with a woman hospitalised in Thailand.A WHO official warned then that it was possible that human-to-human transmission had occurred in families of victims – a sign that the disease had potential to spread far and fast – and, inside China, officials were quietly told to prepare for a pandemic.There was little international attention on the day, though, because Beijing’s dire warnings about a pandemic were made in secret, and a WHO spokesman rowed back from his colleague’s claim.Officially, China had not seen a new case of the coronavirus for over a week the outbreak appeared to be fading. It took another six days for China to publicly acknowledge the gravity of the threat, time that scientists believed meant a further 3,000 people were infected.But on 20 January, officials announced more than 100 new cases and admitted the virus was spreading between humans, a red flag for concern to anyone who works on infectious diseases. The virus could no longer be contained by finding the animal source of the infection and destroying it.Two days later, the scale of the challenge was made clear to the general public when Beijing locked down millions of people. All transport into and out of the metropolis of Wuhan was cut off, an unprecedented modern quarantine that would come at huge human and economic cost.On 29 January, the UK would have its first two confirmed cases of the disease. There was little sense that China’s dilemma and its approach – shut down life as we know it or watch the death toll spiral out of control – might have to be our nightmare within weeks.In early February, Donald Trump announced a ban on travellers who had passed through China in the previous 14 days. Europe began focused testing of people with symptoms and travel histories that linked them to the disease, but little else.Johnson, it seemed, still had Brexit and free trade much more on his mind. Any hint of draconian action to fight coronavirus that might hurt the economy was the last thing he was entertaining.In a speech on Brexit in Greenwich on 3 February, he made clear his views on Wuhan-style lockdowns. “We are starting to hear some bizarre autarkic rhetoric,” he said. ”Humanity needs some government somewhere that is willing at least to make the case powerfully for freedom of exchange, some country ready to take off its Clark Kent spectacles and leap into the phone booth and emerge with its cloak flowing as the supercharged champion of the right of the populations of the Earth to buy and sell freely among each other.”By early March it was abundantly clear to many academics and scientists that the approach being adopted by the UK was markedly different from those followed by other countries. From South Korea to Germany, governments had invested heavily in expanding testing capacity from the first weeks of the epidemic.Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore had brought in controls on travellers from infected regions and strict contact tracing to help understand who could have been exposed, inform them and require self isolation. Face masks became widespread in east Asia, long before it was recommended elsewhere.Testing and contact tracing has been at the heart of the approach advocated by the WHO, so that countries can establish how transmission chains were occurring, in order to break them.Many also brought in some social distancing measures, banning large gatherings, closing schools or extending holidays, and encouraged those who could do to work from home. None were as extreme as China’s shutdown, or the European and American lockdowns that would follow.Writing in the Observer last month, Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Ediburgh, noted the distinct UK approach. “Rather than learning from other countries and following the WHO advice, which comes from experts with decades of experience in tackling outbreaks across the world, the UK has decided to follow its own path. This seems to accept that the virus is unstoppable and will probably become an annual, seasonal infection.“The plan, as explained by the chief science adviser, is to work towards ‘herd immunity’, which is to have the majority of the population contract the virus, develop antibodies and then become immune to it. This theory has been widely used to advocate for mass vaccination for measles, mumps and rubella. The thinking is that, if most of the population is vaccinated, a small percentage can go unvaccinated without cases emerging.”It was not just the UK whose politicians and scientific advisers were, arguably, slow to act in the early stages. Others countries, including Spain and France, were caught out too, but it was Italy’s tragedy that alerted Europe to the scale of the threat it faced.European governments and citizens were forced to reckon with the reality that in an age of global travel, the thousands of miles separating them from China meant almost nothing at all. Thousands of Britons were holidaying in Italy the week that it shut down. They were advised to go into self-quarantine on return, but were not registered by the health authorities, nor were their contacts tracked.Italy and the UK had both had had their first case a day apart at the end of January, but cases rose faster in Italy. The country may just have been unlucky that carriers of the disease flew to its northern cities and ski resorts rather than to other European capitals.Whatever the reason, cases and then deaths started climbing sharply in northern Italy in late February. Dozens of towns were locked down from the 21st, but in the rest of the country life carried on as normal.It was soon clear that the problem had not been contained. On 8 March, the prime minister, Guiseppe Conti, quarantined 16 million people across the north of the country, and the next day extended the lockdown to all of Italy.The measures saved lives, but came too late for thousands of Italians. The death toll outstripped China, and the world looked on horrified as hospitals were overwhelmed, doctors forced to choose who should have a chance on a ventilator and who should die. On 11 March, the WHO declared a global pandemic. On 14 March, Spain went into lockdown, and three days later France did the same.But in the UK there appeared to be greater reluctance to act decisively with lockdowns: the banning of mass gatherings and the closure of pubs and restaurants. The government’s scientific and behavioural science advisers were warning ministers that the public might react badly to draconian measures and would not tolerate them for long.In an apparent show of defiance against the lockdowners, Johnson and Symonds attended the England v Ireland rugby match at Twickenham on 7 March. The Cheltenham Festival, attended over three days to 13 March by 250,000 racegoers, was allowed to go ahead.The tone was about to change. In a Downing Street press conference on 12 March, Johnson, who had said a few days before the first UK death that the disease was “likely to spread a bit more” suddenly became the deliverer of grave warnings.Previous talk by his advisers of avoiding lockdowns and developing “herd immunity” had been banished and replaced by a brutal honesty. “I must level with you,” Johnson told reporters. “More families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time.” On 18 March – just days after Downing Street had suggested it was not on the cards – the government announced the closure of all schools until further noticed. Pubs and restaurants were ordered to shut on 20 March. The UK had come late into line.One former cabinet minister last week described the change of approach as a “screeching U-turn”. Johnson and his ministers were now, even more than before, taking cover behind, and advice from, their scientific and medical advisers. Many of these advisers had become increasingly concerned that the UK had become out of step with other countries because of political resistance from ministers to measures that would hit the economy. The Observer has been told that at least two senior government advisers were on the brink of of quitting before Johnson switched his approach.The government has found itself unable to escape the consequences of a wider failure to prepare. As hospitals threatened to be overwhelmed before orders were given to massively expand capacity, ministers came under intense criticism over the lack of protective equipment for frontline NHS staff, over the lack of ventilators for patients in intensive care, and for a failure to test more widely for Covid-19, particularly among NHS workers.The lack of preparedness and instances of chaotic planning has shocked many in and outside the NHS.Last week, Dr Alison Pittard, the dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, the professional body for intensive care practitioners, said the minimum specifications for the government’s own homegrown ventilator scheme would produce machines that would only treat patients “for a few hours”. “If we had been told that that was the case… we’d have said: ‘Don’t bother, you’re wasting your time. That’s of no use’,” she told the Financial Times.Last month the government missed an EU procurement deadline for ventilators because, minister said, an email went unnoticed. The NHS had said 30,000 more would be needed, Hancock reduced this to 18,000. Pittard said her faculty had been warning for years about a shortage of intensive care capacity and intensive care nurses in hospitals.Normally each intensive care patient would have one intensive care nurse in attendance all the time, she said. Now there was one nurse to six patients, although other staff had been redeployed to intensive care units to plug the gaps and the new system was working because of heroic efforts. Although she was reluctant to criticise the government, she said that if the faculty had been listened to, “we wouldn’t be starting from this place”. Germany, she pointed out, has 29 intensive care beds per 100,000 people, compared with six in the UK.The Tory MP and former health minister Dan Poulter, who works part-time in the NHS, said that given the enormity of the challenge facing government “it almost seems wrong to be critical”.But he believes part of the problem is that insufficient advice has been sought from experienced NHS clinicians who would have warned of problems with PPE early on, of the shortage of ventilators and would have told ministers of the urgent need to test NHS staff.“An early over-reliance on academic modelling also resulted in a lack of experienced frontline NHS clinicians – in other words, the people who really understand the day-to-day challenges our hospitals and health service face – from feeding into the initial Covid-19 action plan,” he said. “This has manifested itself amongst other things in the slowness of providing adequate PPE for frontline NHS staff and in the lack of virus testing for healthcare staff in the earlier part of the outbreak.”When the investigations into the UK’s response to Covid-19 come to be written, there is widespread recognition among experts that this lack of long-term strategic planning will be at the centre of it. So too should be the need to ensure that the views of experts are fed into government more efficiently and widely. The prospect of a previously unknown disease spreading catastrophically around the globe and infecting millions is, after all, not a new one.Indeed, many warnings have been given in the past about the viral dangers facing humanity. “Given the continual emergence of new pathogens ... and the ever-increasing connectedness of our world, there is a significant probability that a large and lethal pandemic will occur in our lifetime,” Bill Gates predicted several years ago. “And it will have the impact of a nuclear war,” he warned, while urging nations to start stockpiling antiviral drugs and therapies. If only.For its part, the WHO prepared – several years ago – a list of viruses with no known treatments or vaccines, illnesses that could one day trigger that pandemic and kill hundreds of thousands. Prospective killers included nipah disease and lassa fever as well as an ailment it simply called “disease X” – “a serious international epidemic caused by a pathogen currently unknown”.As to the most likely nature of that mysterious virus, most modelling assumed that disease X would be flu-like in behaviour, says Dr Josie Golding, the epidemics lead at the Wellcome Trust. After all, influenza had caused so many deadly global outbreaks in the past. As a result, a lot of investment went into making influenza vaccines in preparation, she says. “But have we been thinking about diseases other than influenza that might become pandemics? I don’t think we have. There has been a real gap in our thinking.”Then came the appearance of Covid-19 – caused not by a strain of influenza but by a coronavirus – in November. Initially, only a few cases were highlighted, a trend that began to change early this year with a rise in numbers of infected ill people.“The report that really grabbed my attention came out in mid-January,” says epidemiologist Professor Mark Woolhouse at Edinburgh University. “It said 41 cases of this new respiratory illness had now been diagnosed in one small area of China, around Wuhan. And that set the alarm bells ringing for me.”For Woolhouse, the cluster of cases in one place showed this was not a matter of a few people scattered around China picking up an occasional infection from an animal such as a bat or a chicken. “Forty-one cases in one small area at the same time could not be explained that way. People are not picking this up from animals, I realised. They are actually spreading it to each other. It was already heading out of control.”Ewan Birney, head of the European Bioinfomatics Institute in Cambridgeshire, also noted the significance of the new disease at the time. “I presumed, at first, that this one would also burn itself out, probably somewhere in Asia,” he says.Then there was the infectiousness of the new virus. A person with Sars generally starts to display symptoms before they infect other people. That makes it much easier to contain. But this was not the case with Covid-19. Early data from China – again released in January – showed the virus was being spread from people who were displaying only the mildest symptoms, or in some cases no symptoms. This was making the condition very difficult to track, says virologist Professor Jonathan Ball of Nottingham University.“At that point I realised this outbreak was going to be very serious,” he added. “I sent a tweet to a colleague in Australia. It simply said: ‘This one is out of the bag properly’. He sent one back agreeing with me.”Around this time, Paul Nurse, Nobel laureate and head of the Francis Crick Institute, recalls attending a conference where he met Mark Wolpert, head of UK Research and Innovation, the organisation that funds a vast slice of British scientific research.“He had just received a text message from a colleague about the outbreak and we started to discuss the implications,” Nurse recalls. “It did not take us long for us both to realise this was going to be very significant. It took another two or three weeks to confirm these worst fears – by mid-February.”By this time, Birney had realised the virus had a real sting in its tail and could cause serious illness among the elderly and those with other underlying serious ailments. “It was half-term and I was on holiday with my parents. All I wanted to do was to get the holiday over and then get them back to their house in the country where they could keep themselves isolated.”In February, sporadic cases of Covid-19 were appearing round the country, recalls Tom Wingfield, a clinician and infectious disease expert based at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. “These were cases that had been brought into the country, mainly from China or Italy. Then there was an outbreak in Brighton and I realised that the virus had established itself in a community there. It was a turning point.”Britain was still doing quite well in containing the disease by testing, tracing contact and setting up quarantine for those suspected of being infected with Covid-19 at this time. “Then, in March, the government decided to abandon this approach and shift from containing the disease to delaying its progress,” says Wingfield. “I would really like to know why the decision to give up testing and contact tracing was taken.”Many other researchers also question why the government took so long to react to their warnings. “Part of the trouble was there were other virologists who were saying this was going to be like Sars or flu and there was not too much to worry about,” says Ball. “But Sars happened in 2003. The world is much more connected now than it was then. More to the point, Covid-19 was also much more infectious than Sars. And so it started appearing in lots of other countries.“Perhaps some of us should have got up in front of BBC News and said you lot ought to be petrified because this is going to be a pandemic that will kill hundreds of thousands of people,” adds Ball. “None of us thought this was a particularly constructive thing to do, but maybe with hindsight we should have. If there had been more voices, maybe politicians would have taken this a bit more seriously.”“There is no question that we were insufficiently prepared,” Nurse says. “We had been warned a few years ago when reports made it clear that the UK was not ready to combat a major flu pandemic and we did not take up that warning. As a result, we were caught out.”He and many others say an inquiry into Britain’s Covid-19 preparedness will have to be held at some point but stress that this should not be started until the crisis has been dealt with in the UK.Professor Ian Boyd, a former chief scientific adviser at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, agrees. “There is a great danger there will be a lot of looking back with the benefits of hindsight and poking fingers of blame,” warns Boyd. “But when you are in the middle of things you have to make a lot of very hard 50-50 decisions, and sometimes you make the wrong call. On the other hand, there is no harm in making sure that we learn as many lessons as we can.”Boris Johnson, after his own brush with death at the hands of Covid-19, will presumably no longer take the gung-ho attitude to illness that he has always has. A former Tory minister said: “If Boris had any sense he would take control of the inquiry and lead it.”One conclusion that experts are already drawing is that it was those countries close to China, with memories of Sars, or cultural ties to their neighbour, which were much faster to act in response to Covid-19. Perhaps most notable in its success was Taiwan. Closely linked by economic and cultural ties to mainland China, Taiwan could have been at high risk of a major Covid-19 epidemic. Tourists and business people travelled regularly back and forth.But helped perhaps by having an epidemiologist as vice-president, the government set up a gold standard regime of testing and contact tracing that means that nearly three months on from its first confirmed infection, it has registered fewer than 400 cases and six deaths.Taiwan’s extensive testing and thorough contact tracing are precisely the kind of action that the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt is demanding before the UK lockdown is lifted. Hunt points out that it is one of the essential conditions set by the WHO to avoid a second wave resulting from an easing of restrictions.Hong Kong, which also suffered from the Sars crisis, also moved early to enforce quarantine and social distancing, as well as widespread mask wearing, and today has registered just over 1,000 cases and only four deaths.In late February, South Korea looked like it was on a trajectory to disaster, with the highest number of confirmed cases outside China, and numbers rising rapidly. But after the country’s first infection, the government met medical companies and urged them to start developing coronavirus test kits on a massive scale.The results were impressive. When the epidemic hit, it was ready to deploy largescale testing. Its measures allowed South Korea to become the second country to flatten its coronavirus curve, without the sweeping shutdowns of society and economic activity that China had pioneered and the west would be forced to adopt.China’s experience should have provided a grim template for western countries to use to prepare. The speed with which Wuhan’s crisis had intensified showed that a relatively advanced medical system could be swamped. Within three weeks there were over 64,000 people infected and 1,000 dead.The pleas for help from Wuhan’s residents and doctors were to be echoed by those from Italy a few weeks later, and soon after the UK.Look back three months, and in China there were not enough tests to work out who had coronavirus, there was not enough protective equipment for medical staff treating patients, and then, soon, tragically there were not enough hospital beds and ventilators for sick patients. These are exactly the challenges faced by authorities from New York to Rome, London to Madrid.If the UK has serious questions to answer, the country that so far has seen the worst of the outbreak, the United States, was slowest of all to act. Trump for months ignored, played down or lied about the threat posed by coronavirus, leaving inidual states to act unilaterally as it became clear it had already taken hold on US soil.On 17 March parts of California issued “shelter in place” orders, effectively a lockdown. By the end of that week New York City had also shut down, along with a dozen states, and the majority of the rest of the country had put some restrictions in place. Only five states had few or no controls.There have now been nearly 700,000 confirmed cases in the US and over 33,000 deaths actual numbers are likely to be higher for both. The economy has also been devastated, with more than 22 million out of work as businesses collapse or shrink under the strain.Trump insists the US is turning a corner, and has tried to blame – among other targets – the WHO for failing to fully raise the alarm, and has stripped it of its US funding.There have certainly been questions about the organisation’s strong praise for China and the exclusion of Taiwan, which may have contributed to the delay in recognising human-to-human transmission was occurring. But it began daily briefings on 22 January and had declared a global health emergency by the end of that month.While initially sceptical about China’s distancing measures, it urged other countries to adopt them once there was evidence they were working. It warned about shortages of PPE over a month ago, and since the beginning of the outbreak has urged countries, including the UK, to “test, test, test” to contain the virus – a strategy followed by almost all countries that have managed to suppress it.A senior Whitehall source with detailed knowledge of the UK’s response and those of other countries said: “The fact is that those countries who knew a lot about Sars quickly saw the danger. But in the UK the attitude among politicians and also scientists was that it was really just some form of a flu. All the government’s pandemic planning was based on a flu scenario. And then it turned out to be something different and far, far worse and the response was completely inadequate.”And we are going to be living with the consequences for a long time. Don’t expect a vaccine to come to the rescue in the short term, says Nabarro. “For the foreseeable future, we are going to have to find ways to go about our lives with this virus as a constant threat to our lives. That means isolating those who show signs of the disease and also their contacts. Older people will have to be protected. That is going to be the new normal for us all.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4b36619017d424a17a272217bd9ce0269ac7622/161_0_3750_2251/master/3750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2ff04db94d25e493628c38dec42be9b","title":"together at home lady gaga and rolling stones headline tribute to frontline workers","story":"A who’s who of locked-down celebrities take part in the global tribute to the the people battling Covid-19 every dayLady Gaga, Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones and Beyonce headlined a global special of music, comedy and personal stories in what Gaga called a “love letter” to frontline workers battling the coronavirus pandemic.The One World: Together at Home, broadcast across multiple television and streaming channels around the world, featured a who’s who of pop culture.

File photograph: Alan BetsonThe Cavan is proportionally the worst affected county for the coronavirus outside of Dublin, latest provisional figures are suggesting.While in real terms the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 infections in the Border county is a fraction of those in the capital, infection rates in Cavan appear to be much higher than in the rest of the country when measured against its actual population.The figures released by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC) on Saturday compare cases to county populations.They show 345 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Cavan, a county with a population of about 76,000, as of midnight on Wednesday.However, that would translate into almost 453 cases for every 100,000 people, making it the proportionally the second-worst-affected county in the State.Earlier this month, the Irish Hospital Consultants Association (IHCA) said doctors were being dispatched to work at Cavan General Hospital, after it was reported that up to 70 doctors and nurses working there had become infected with Covid-19.Meanwhile, in Dublin, there were 6,567 confirmed cases up to midnight on Wednesday, which represents more than 487 infections per 100,000 in the population.Westmeath ranks the third highest when comparing cases to county populations, with an infection rate of what would be some 358 cases per 100,000 people.The figures are in a report prepared by the HPSC for the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET). It is titled Epidemiology of Covid-19 in Ireland and it notes that the data is provisional.Border countiesOther than Leitrim, Border counties all appear to have significantly higher rates per population than much of the south and west of the country.In Louth, which includes dense urban centres Drogheda and Dundalk, the confirmed Covid-19 rate per 100,000 population is almost 298 cases. In Monaghan it is more than 270, while in Donegal the rate is just in excess of 221.Sparsely populated Leitrim has a rate of almost 144.The figures compare unfavourably with parts of the southeast, most notably.Wexford has the lowest rate per 100,000 population, at less than 51 cases. That rate is almost nine times lower than that of Cavan, and a fraction of those of all the other Border counties.Waterford is the second lowest at just below 88.Even counties with large cities have notably lower rates of cases per head of population than most of the Border counties.In Cork, the rate is 174 cases in Limerick it is 176, while Galway is recording 103 confirmed cases per 100,000 people.Counties around Dublin all rank higher than the south and west: Kildare has a rate of 279 confirmed infections per 100,000 population Wicklow has a rate of almost 270, while Meath has a rate of 216.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4232524.1587193998!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish musician stuck on cruise ship in sydney feels forgotten","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKate Heneghan, from Co Mayo, on the Late Late Show. Photograph: RTÉ PlayerAn Irish musician has told of her struggle and feeling of being “forgotten” whilst stuck in her cabin aboard the Ruby Princess Cruise Ship in Sydney since the outbreak of Covid-19.Kate Heneghan (24), from Castlebar in Co Mayo, has been stuck on the cruise ship just outside Sydney for the past 28 days. There are five Irish people still on the ship, four members of the band Emerald Tide and an engineer.The passengers of the cruise ship got word on March 16th that the prime minister of New Zealand was closing the ports and no longer allowing ships to enter the country, which resulted in the ship making a three-day voyage back to Sydney, where 2,700 passengers disembarked on March 19th.“On March 20th, we got word that there were positive cases on board, so we were quarantined and isolated here then on March 21st,” Ms Heneghan said on the Late Late Show on Friday night.The Ruby Princess cruise ship, owned by Carnival Corp, has been docked at Port Kembla in New South Wales since and has been linked to hundreds of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Australia and about a third of the country’s reported deaths.The violinist and harpist described her situation as a “huge scandal”. Speaking to the talk show host Ryan Tubridy, Ms Heneghan said her contract as a musician aboard the cruise ship was due to finish on April 4th, but she remains unaware to date of when she and the other band members will be allowed to disembark from the ship.“It’s a big political game of chess at the moment,” Ms Heneghan told Mr Tubridy, regarding the police investigation into whether there was criminal negligence in the handling of the health issues on the cruise ship.“We’re just pawns in this big political game and kind of forgotten about until decisions are made and we get news that we can disembark and get repatriated home.”“We were told via intercom by the hotel general manager, who updates us daily, that there was a possibility of us going to Manila to let off the Filipino crew. One of our sister ships is outside Manila and the Philippines won’t let them port. We also heard through the media that we might be going to the United States, which would be disastrous for us because we don’t have visas,” she said.Ms Heneghan told Mr Tubridy that her “one wish” for the four Irish in her band and the fifth Irish citizen on board is “to get off this boat before it sails away”.Despite the situation, the young woman was in good spirits and said “structure and routine” have been “absolutely vital in maintaining a bit of sanity”. Ms Heneghan spends her days doing yoga, practicing her instruments, watching Netflix and staying in contact with friends and family.Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4231819.1587147602!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus brexit a key issue says us special envoy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS special envoy for Northern Ireland Mick Mulvaney: “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal.”  Photograph: Al DragoBloombergThe US special envoy for Northern Ireland, Mick Mulvaney, has said he intends to travel to Northern Ireland as soon as the coronavirus restrictions are lifted, as he prepares to assume his post.Mr Mulvaney said a key focus for him in the coming weeks is how the Covid-19 crisis will impact on Brexit. The British government’s plan to deal with legacy issues from the Troubles, announced on March 18th, also promises to be a focus when normal life resumes, he said. Mr Mulvaney, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in March, had been scheduled to make his first visit to Northern Ireland as US special envoy next month. But the coronavirus has put that plan on hold. “I have been using the time to familiarise myself with the issues. Obviously, Covid-19 is the focus of everyone’s attention right now. It’s a very fluid situation,” he said, speaking from his home in South Carolina, the state he represented in Congress before joining the Trump administration. Like millions of people across the United States, the former White House chief of staff has been working from home where he is based with his wife and three children, as states have imposed stay-at-home restrictions. He says he will visit Northern Ireland “as soon as the door opens”.Interest in positionThe Irish-American politician has been communicating with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, and Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis in the past few weeks.He has also spoken to previous holders of the post, such as Richard Haass, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, who was appointed by George W Bush. Mr Mulvaney (52), who reportedly had expressed a long-held interest in the position that had been vacant since the end of the Obama presidency, said his appointment was a measure of the Trump administration’s interest in Northern Ireland and Brexit in particular. He said Mr Trump views the post as akin to the role held by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who he appointed to manage the White House strategy on the Middle East. “The president knew that Brexit is going to be a big deal – it’s a big deal just generally, and in terms of North-South relations – so he said to me: ‘Jared is going to go and take care of the Palestinians and Israelis, you make sure things go smoothly over there,” says Mr Mulvaney. The husband of Mr Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, is widely viewed to have had minimal success with bringing peace to the Middle East. Trump and PompeoMr Mulvaney visited Northern Ireland in February ahead of his appointment, where he met with First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill and the new permanent secretary at the Northern Ireland Office, Madeline Alessandri. He also met Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and US ambassador Ed Crawford, a Trump appointee, at Farmleigh.The role of Northern Ireland envoy falls under the remit of the US state department, and Mr Mulvaney will report to Mr Trump and US secretary of state Mike Pompeo. Mr Mulvaney was replaced as Mr Trump’s chief of staff by congressman Mark Meadows last month. Like many in the administration, Mr Mulvaney played down the risk of coronavirus as recently as late February.Asked if he missed working at the White House, he replied: “I’m always happy to be home, but it’s kind of strange to be out of Washington at this time.” He says he still talks to the president and points out that Mr Meadows is a friend of his. Both were co-founders of the Freedom Caucus on Capitol Hill, a group of conservative, Republican lawmakers.

received 36,000 applications of interest following a nationwide appeal for recruits, but only 6,000 had come forward to be interviewed for a role when selected.Some of the reasons for turning down the job included the length of the contract, location of the farm, and inability to work full time because of care responsibilities.Hundreds of workers are often flown in from Romania to pick lettuce and asparagus, but farmers and producers are worried that the coronavirus pandemic will mean a dramatic shortage of pickers.Concerns over a shortfall in staff prompted the government-backed Feed the Nation campaign this year.It was launched by three major UK labour providers with the aim of recruiting 90,000 workers to harvest fruit and vegetables this season.George Eustice, the environment secretary, said: “We need to mobilise the British workforce to fill that gap and make sure our excellent fruit and vegetables are on people’s plates over the summer months … I would encourage as many people as possible to sign up.”Concordia, one of the three recruitment companies in the alliance, said: “To date 900 people have explicitly rejected the roles we have offered and 112 have taken up our offer of a role on a UK farm.”Sarah Boparan, the operations director at Hops, added: “Some are saying they cannot commit to 40 hours a week, some can only commit for a few weeks whereas some roles can

photographs sealed firmly in the family album.But despite dubious hairstyles and recanted couture, the public and celebrities alike have rushed to display pictures of their cherubic 20-year-old selves using the viral Me At 20 hashtag on Twitter.Figures from Nigella Lawson to former Chancellor Sajid Javid leapt at the chance to join thousands of others in revealing their photos, and perhaps a psychological need.That this array of faded Polaroids shows youthful good looks along with the disastrous fashion choices, in what psychologists have termed a “harmless ego-boost”, might explain the popularity of the trend.But alongside this “humblebrag” of posting long-forgotten perms with equally long-forgotten chiselled jaws and bagless eyes, there may be a deeper psychology at work.Experts have examined the trend and believe there may be comfort in the innocence and perceived happiness of the past, despite the hairstyles, which contrasts sharply with the more menacing present.On Thursday the online trend erupted and famous faces in the UK were quick to show what they used to look like, as were thousands across the country. While the photos posted online may recall a time before fashion sense, they also conjure a period before career and family pressure, political upheaval, and a global pandemic.Such trends may also give a positive reprieve from the withering judgment common online, and a simple chance to show off.“There is definitely an element of nostalgia,” psychologist Dr Rachel M Allan told The Daily .“We have a tendency to look back to a time when we perceive ourselves being innocent, life feeling different, more free.  “We contrast that with how the world feels now.  Nostalgia can be a comfort.”In a time of isolation and reduced socialising, people can also rush to join a trend that allows them to connect with others online, Dr Allan suggested.Celebrities wading into an online trend may also have fueled interest and encouraged their fans to dig out their dated photos.  Along with social connection, the trend also allowed people to smuggle their dashing good looks into the public eye under the falsely deprecating auspices of a dodgy haircut.For those in the public eye who have become venerable figures, it might be a chance to remind the world of a vigorous past self. “For some people there might be a wish to show themselves having looked great,” said Dr Allan.“They may want to have a humblebrag.“And why not?  In terms of what else goes on on the internet, it appears to become a harmless ego boost.”The “what else” which often goes on throughout social media may explain why so many people felt comfortable engaging in what could be dismissed a narcissistic trend, but may in fact offer psychological relief.Psychologist warn that online discourse can often be harsh, judgemental, or simply insulting, leading to defensiveness and perhaps poor body imageDr Allan believes #MeAt20 offered a window of opportunity for rare praise.She said: “It allows people to show themselves in a kinder light.“It allows people to step away from the self-image they may have acquired from the pressures of being online.”In this spirit of judgment-free positivity, celebrities including Les Dennis, Laurence Fox, Carol Vorderman, and Booker Prize-winning novelist Bernardine Evaristo have joined in.As with many internet trends, others have mocked the perceived bandwagon and posted pictures ranging from wild animals to Nosferatu to represent their younger selves. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker

another","story":"When the last deadly pandemic swept across America, the small copper mining town of Butte was particularly hard hit.The Spanish flu of 1918 claimed the lives of more than 1,000 of its residents - around a third of the state of Montana’s total casualties. The powerful business owners who had an interest in keeping the mines running refused to shut down, allowing the virus to spread unchecked.This time around, the town - scarred by the memory of the tragedy - has taken no chances.Butte, which has a large Irish immigrant population, was among the first to shut down bars and restaurants and even cancelled its famous St Patrick’s Day celebrations before the first case of Covid-19 was recorded in the state.Most in the town have relatives who died during the influenza outbreak, or know people who did - a collective trauma from the past which has shaped the present.“Shutting down St Patrick\u0027s was like an earth tremor here but it was accepted with wisdom and understanding,” Father Patrick Beretta, the priest at Butte’s Immaculate Conception and St Patrick Parishes, told the . “I walked my dogs that day and I did not see a single gathering - a seismic departure from the wild celebrations of the past.”Father Beretta, who is studying how communities build resilience, promptly decided to take his service online: broadcasting live on YouTube on Sundays rather than risk the health of his congregation.“We had closed our churches even before the order came to do so,” he said. “The trauma of 1918 is still haunting the collective memory of today. As a result people here took very seriously very early on the coronavirus dangers.”Residents began self-isolating long before Governor Steve Bullock declared a statewide lockdown. Butte has one of the highest rates of compliance in the country.Its swift action seems, at least for now, to be working: counting just six confirmed cases of Montana’s 208.The picture was not so rosy a century ago.The saloons servicing thirsty miners remained open, as did the brothels, allowing the flu to run rampant.At the height of the outbreak, 10 residents were dying a day in a town with a population of 100,000. Local newspaper the Great Falls Tribune reported “the undertakers no longer garage their \u0027death wagons\u0027, but leave them in the street as the calls became so frequent.”The deaths only began to slow when the town finally started to close down in November 1918, nearly 10 months after the first detected case.The death toll ended up being on par with San Francisco and Philadelphia - two of the worst-affected cities in the country.“Mortality rate here was astronomical, largely as a result of the nature of mining life, confinement underground and above ground in overcrowded boarding houses,” said Father Beretta.“The Irish Butte inherited an intensely social culture. Churches, pubs, halls were always packed providing voracious vehicles of contagion.”He said the particularly rich “emotional landscape” of Butte was shaped by two defining tragedies and the recovery from them: the 1917 Granite Mountain mining disaster, which saw 168 miners killed in a fire, and the 1918 flu.It was also influenced by the resilience of the Irish after the great famine of the 1840s. The earliest Irish immigrants to arrive in Butte were children and survivors of the famine.“My town was one of the places hardest hit in America, in part because many believed the cure was worse than the disease,” saidKathleen McLaughlin, a local Butte journalist, quoting a recent speech by President Donald Trump in which he suggested ending the shutdown. “When you hear that reopening the economy is preferable to warnings of public health experts who want us to stay home and distance ourselves, remember the graveyards in Butte.”Butte, which now has around 35,000 residents, has rallied in recent weeks. Seamstresses in the town have turned their hand to making masks for medical workers, pop-up delivery services are ensuring the elderly and vulnerable are getting daily meals.Resident Sabrina Holland said its history of hard times gives people a greater appreciation of the need for a community to pull together. “Butte people have a sense of history that is so deep within us, that we see a current crisis as not a current crisis, but another thing to get through,” said Ms Holland, whose great-grandfather Daniel Holland died from the Spanish flu in 1919. “It’s such a Butte mentality. We’ve been through so much, we can survive,” she told the Montana Free Press.Father Beretta said that while the town understands the measures it needs to take, it has not stopped people suffering from the social separation that it has imposed.“The community hurts not being able to gather in sympathy,” he said. “But every day I think of the people of 1918. They are my teachers in coping emotionally with this pandemic, they are the teachers of the entire Butte community.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus diary postcard seoul coronavirus coronavirus","story":"I need to go do my weekly shopping. Apart from everyone wearing a mask, nothing much has changed here it’s very much business as usual. Market stalls are abundant. Supermarket shelves are full. There’s never been any panic buying. We’ve had no lockdown.  What we have had is a pervasive “trace, test, treat” programme designed to catch every infection. The government is able to look into our private records (credit card, telephone etc) to “contact trace” our movements and treat every potential infection. As I take the subway, I notice how meticulous cleaning staff are at scrubbing the station clean.Today I’m entitled to my weekly ration of two face masks. After the outbreak emerged, masks sold out instantly. So the government decided to regulate supply and allocate most stocks into an affordable ration system. I’m a 1987 baby. People whose birth year ends in ‘2’ or ‘7’ can purchase their ration on Tuesday. Different birth year, different day of the week. I arrive at the pharmacy, present my resident card. My purchase is registered on a centralised database. Two for about £2. To Koreans, access to a mask is like a human right. Everyone wears them. Even babies wear masks.It’s parliamentary elections day, and these will be elections like no other. Every precautionary measure is being taken to ensure safety. At the disinfected polling stations, voters must get their temperatures checked, sanitise their hands, and wear hygiene gloves. Even people who are in self-isolation are allowed to vote at a designated time. I visited my local station to find that there was a sense of mild excitement, people perhaps a little nervous yet determined to exercise their right to vote. Many were taking selfies with their hygiene gloves on. When polling stations close at 6 pm, it’s a record turnout: 66.2 per cent, the highest turnout for parliamentary elections in 28 years. If anything, coronavirus incentivised people to vote after seeing how well the country’s been doing versus the rest of the world.What a night. It’s a landslide victory for President Moon Jae-in’s ruling party, winning 180 seats in the 300-member parliament, now dubbed the “dinosaur party” by Korean media. Let’s be honest, these elections were all about coronavirus and the government’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis. Cases are going down by the day (22 in the last 24 hours, of which 11 were from abroad).New infections fall below 30 for the fifth straight day. 22 today, of which 14 cases were imported from abroad. My gym finally re-opened after weeks of closure due to an extended social-distancing drive. Things are a little different now. When entering, we must get our body heat checked, wear a mask, and keep a two-metre distance between each other when working out, changing, and showering. I’ve decided to finally go out with friends tonight for Korean barbecue. The backstreets are buzzing. Couples are out, people are getting drunk. What coronavirus? 18 new infections today, half from abroad. This is the first time under 20 in two months.  I go out for a walk near Gyeongbokgung, one of Seoul’s famous royal palaces. This place used to be swarming with tourists. Obviously none at the moment. But the palace guards are still here, wearing face masks! I feel guilty being able to enjoy myself while my parents back in London are stuck at home. It’s frustrating to know that I can get tested if I show symptoms, however mild, and have a guaranteed hospital bed were I to test positive.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 strategies britain planned herd immunity asia intended","story":"A \u0027herd immunity\u0027 strategy was baked into Britain\u0027s official pandemic plans, while South East Asian nations always intended to contain a new virus, analysis by the  has shown.Britain assumed a deadly virus would cripple the NHS and kill up 750,000 people during a secret cross-government exercise held in 2016 to test preparedness for an outbreak, officials have admitted.The assumption a new virus could not be contained is also explicitly stated in the governments pandemic strategy documents.We discussed the levels of herd immunity as part of that scenario, a Whitehall source said. Meanwhile nations including Singapore and South Korea drew up detailed plans to prevent a virus spreading, with mass testing, contact tracing and huge stockpiles of protective equipment.It comes as the government formally refused a request for the release of the findings of the 2016 pandemic drill, code-named Exercise Cygnus, under the terms of the Freedom of Information Act.A senior Whitehall official involved in drawing up Cygnus, a major test of this country’s pandemic preparations held in October 2016, admitted lessons from other countries had been “entirely ignored”.“Everything we planned for was based on the idea that a disease would kill lots and lots of people,” the official told the  .“We didn’t spend a lot of time exploring how we could prevent it in the first place. Instead we looked at how we could build up mortuary space and intensive care beds after it had already spread.“I can’t remember that we ever discussed what they were doing in South Korea and places like that. It simply wasn’t on our radar. We were sort of ploughing our own furrow.“Given the current lack of testing capacity and PPE, you could say that was a mistake.”Exercise Cygnus discovered that Britain would be quickly overwhelmed by a major outbreak amid a shortage of critical care beds, morgue capacity and personal protective equipment.The Department of Health refused to release the Cygnus report, despite calls from senior MPs.Analysis by this newspaper shows major disparities between preparations taken by the UK and other nations across the world.While nations in the Asia Pacific region make up 9 percent of the world’s population, they have only experienced 1 percent of the cases, and less than 1 percent of the deaths. Britain, meanwhile, is expected to suffer the highest death rate in Europe. Many Asian nations had already drawn up plans for mass testing using networks of public laboratories to chart the spread of disease, and prevent it spreading, according to documents seen by the South Korea, which has conducted more tests per head of the population than any other country, already had 17 regional and local labs in place ahead of the pandemic. “During the early stages of the pandemic when testing volume is heavy, private facilities may be used to perform RT-PCR tests for the detection of new cases of infection”, its planning document notes. Britain\u0027s pandemic plan, updated after the swine flu pandemic of 2009 took a different view.“It will not be possible to stop the spread of, or to eradicate, the pandemic influenza virus, either in the country of origin or in the UK, as it will spread too rapidly and too widely”, says the UK Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Strategy. “The expectation must be that the virus will inevitably spread and that any local measures taken to disrupt or reduce the spread are likely to have very limited or partial success at a national level and cannot be relied on as a way to ‘buy time’. South East nations also built up huge stockpiles of personal protective equipment after suffering outbreaks of SARS and MERS in the early 2000s, the documents show.In Taiwan, families were advised to build up their own supplies of masks and gloves, while Singapore said all workplaces should stockpile protective gear.Taiwan also developed a policy of “sheltering” - a detailed plan for a complete lockdown.Nearly all the Asian countries, including Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand, also had preparations in place for contact tracing to help stop the disease spreading.A Department of Health spokesperson said: “The coronavirus outbreak calls for decisive action, at home and abroad, and the World Health Organisation recognises that the UK is one of the most prepared countries in the world for pandemic flu.“As the public would expect, we regularly test our pandemic plans and the learnings from previous exercises have helped allow us to rapidly respond to COVID-19. We are committed to be as transparent as possible, and in publishing the SAGE evidence the public are aware of the science behind the government’s response.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"oxford university admitting students miss grades following a","story":"Oxford University is admitting more students who missed their offers in the wake of Michael Gove’s A-level reforms, new figures show.Of those who missed their offers from Oxford last year, over a third (36 per cent) were accepted anyway, up from 26 per cent in 2016.In 2019, top A-level grades saw their biggest drop since records began, as the proportion of As and A*s fell to lowest in over a decade.The number of top grades dropped by 0.9 percentage points, which is the largest fall since the Joint Council for Qualification’s data began in 2000.The majority of A-level subjects have been re-designed to exclude coursework and modules.The reforms, initiated by Michael Gove when he was education secretary, followed years of rampant grade inflation, with swelling numbers of students achieving top grades.Universities complained that thousands of students with A or A* grades would make it impossible for them to distinguish who the very best candidates were.But an Oxford don said there was some “panic” among admissions tutors about the number of students who are now missing their offers.“The Gove reforms meant that A-levels got harder,” he told the .“We have been in this comfort zone of everyone getting AAA. The students are still given the standard offer, but there were more kids missing offers than ever before. Nobody really knew what changing A-levels would mean.”Last year 663 students missed their offers from Oxford, up from 462 in 2016, meaning a rise of 44 per cent. Of those who missed their offers, 237 were admitted in 2019, up from 122 four years previously.“There is now a debate about whether we need to do more over-offering because of the underachieving on grades,” the admissions source added. They explained that another possible reason for the growing number of pupils who are admitted despite missing their offers could be the increasingly pressure on Oxford colleges to boost their intake of students from difficult backgrounds. “If you are going to go into that territory you have to be more flexible about exactly what happens,” he said. “You are one step away from differential offers, which we have not done yet - but whether we are doing it post hoc is another matter”.Last year Cambridge admitted a tranche of  “second chance” students from poor backgrounds, after allowing post A-level applications for the first time.In a bid to improve ersity, the university earmarked extra places for disadvantaged students who performed better than expected in their A-levels.The move by Cambridge is aimed at admitting more talented students from disadvantaged background who have already applied and had an interview, but “narrowly missed out” on an offer.Implementing a similar system at Oxford is under discussion, the source said, but no firm decisions have yet been made.An Oxford University spokesman said: “We apply some clemency when the candidate has done well in the admissions test (if there is one) and the interview, and if at the time of their A-levels there are extenuating circumstances and the conditional offer is narrowly missed.“Qualification reforms do tend to cause changes in schools until they are fully embedded and that is one of the reasons why Oxford does not rely on just school qualifications, but uses its own assessments including admissions tests and interviews. We find using a range of metrics helps us assess the potential to study at Oxford.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"take daily dose vitamin d due reduced sun exposure lockdown","story":"The Government will advise the public to start taking a daily dose of vitamin D as they are not getting enough sunshine during the coronavirus lockdown, The  understands. Public Health England (PHE) previously recommended everyone should take a 10 microgram supplement of vitamin D during the autumn and winter months. Sunshine exposure during the spring and summer meant this was no longer necessary for most people. The  understands this guidance will be updated this week recommending everyone should continue taking the supplement, as the coronavirus lockdown has reduced the public’s sun exposure. Vitamin D is created in the body by absorbing direct sunlight onto the skin, as well as through our diet. People with darker skin pigmentation are more likely to have a vitamin D deficiency because it is harder for the ultraviolet light to pass through. PHE previously advised certain groups at risk of vitamin D deficiency should take the supplement throughout the year, such as care home residents who receive little or no sun exposure and ethnic minority groups. This recommendation is now expected to be extended to the whole population and will mirror advice issued by the Scottish Government earlier this month, which said everyone should take a 10 microgram dose as being indoors will mean people are not getting enough sunlight. Experts believe vitamin D could also reduce an inidual’s susceptibility” to the coronavirus, as research has also shown it can help protect against acute respiratory infections.A study published in the BMJ in 2017, which pulled data from 25 clinical trials, showed the supplement can help prevent acute respiratory tract infections, particularly among those with a vitamin D deficiency. Lead author Professor Adrian Martineau, a Clinical Professor of Respiratory Infection and Immunity from Queen Mary University of London, told The : These results cannot automatically be extrapolated to coronavirus as this is a new pathogen.However, the Department of Health already recommends that UK citizens have a daily intake of 10 micrograms per day and that is not widely adhered to.There is little or no downside to following this advice and it may have a benefit in reducing susceptibility to coronavirus.Vitamin D supports the immune system by making antimicrobial peptides, a natural antibiotic. They work by “bashing holes in the membranes of microorganisms”, Professor Martineau said.When someone is vitamin D deficient this process doesn’t work effectively, but taking a supplement “switches on the signalling to turn on these antimicrobial peptides in response to an infectious challenge,” he added.Dr Noel Baxter, GP and Asthma UK medical adviser, said further trials are needed to conclusively prove the effects of vitamin D reducing the risk of respiratory tract infections. But for those with limited sunlight exposure it is recommended to take vitamin D all year round.Dr Baxter added: “This may be particularly relevant in the current climate for vulnerable people in the shielding group who are staying indoors.”Those with pre-existing conditions should check with their doctor before taking vitamin D, he added.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uneasy alliance scientists government face coronavirus pandemic","story":"Looking back, it was a moment that Sir Patrick Vallance may now view as regrettable.As he articulated the government’s decision to pursue a policy of “herd immunity” to the television journalist interviewing him, the Chief Scientific Adviser stressed that it was only following “the most up to date and relevant advice” from the experts appointed to navigate a way through the unfolding coronavirus crisis.Herd immunity, he explained, would necessitate around 60 per cent of the country contracting the disease so that, once recovered, their bodies’ acquired antibodies would effectively protect the rest of the population, too.It was put to him that, with the virus having an estimated fatality rate of up to one per cent, that was potentially an awful lot of deaths to countenance. Sir Patrick couldn’t deny it.“That is a real prospect, this is a nasty disease.”Neither he nor his interlocutor spelled out the numbers, but anyone with an elementary grasp of maths could have deduced that achieving herd immunity might therefore cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. That interview was on March 13, a day after Sir Patrick, side by side with Boris Johnson, had first floated the idea of herd immunity at a press conference.The PM had also taken that opportunity to declare that people with mild symptoms of the coronavirus should self-isolate themselves at home for a week but stopped short of calling for the cancelling of mass gatherings or closing schools.It has now emerged that for nearly a fortnight the government had been privy to scientific advice from Imperial College, London, which had forecast mass casualties from the Covid-19 strain. Mathematical modelling of potential deaths had been made available as early as March 1, according to Professor Neil Ferguson, who led the Imperial team.Furthermore, on March 12, the date of the “herd immunity” press conference, Imperial had presented a further study to the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) which predicted a quarter of a million fatalities in the UK unless truly stringent measures were taken to suppress the virus.Yet here was Sir Patrick, a day later, insisting that fully suppressing the virus with a lengthy lockdown was unhelpful as it would only lead to a second, potentially larger, outbreak towards the end of the year.“We want to…not suppress it so we get the second peak and also allow enough of us who are going to get mild illness to become immune to this to help with the sort of whole population response, which would protect everybody.”Sir Patrick may not have known it, but the ground was already shifting beneath him. According to insiders, the latest offering from Imperial had indeed made an impact and a seismic change in thinking was now taking place in the government’s inner circle. Actually seeing the numbers starkly on a page – 250,000 deaths unless we lockdown the country – had apparently concentrated a few minds.The result was that, even as herd immunity was being expounded on national television by the hapless Sir Patrick, the very real prospect of abandoning its pursuit of was now being actively considered in No10. The government was about to change direction, but it was hardly to be a handbrake turn.It was a full eleven days after the Imperial study’s call for full suppression before Mr Johnson announced that he was putting the country into lockdown. That was nearly four weeks ago, and since then the line from the government has been consistent: stay at home, only go out for essentials such as food or exercise and keep the vulnerable isolated.For now, it seems, the country is on a single, straight, Imperial-sanctioned path.Why did it take so long to get here? Is it definitely the right path? And how do we go from here, in an unsustainable state of economic stasis, back to something resembling normality? The key to understanding the first of those questions lies in the structure of the committees set up to advise the government in such times of crisis.SAGE, and the three sub-committees which feed into it, are comprised of a range of scientists, the identities of whom are largely unknown, apparently in order to protect them from threats. This opaque nature, and the fact that the committees are dominated by epidemiologists, behavioural scientists and particularly mathematical modellers, has led to criticism.Professor Anthony Costello, of University College’s Institute for Global Health, says: “I think that is quite a narrow view of science. You needed independent public health scientists, social health scientists, IT people, logisticians – and maybe citizen scientists – people that understand how you collect data on a large scale from communities and feed it back to them.”Until the pivotal Imperial report was acted upon, it had appeared to some that the government was actually most in thrall to the behavioural scientists. One report, submitted to SAGE on March 4, examined the potential public resistance to various anti-viral interventions, such as school closures, and concluded they would be “highly disruptive” and “likely to present an unequal burden to different sections of society.”Some committee members clearly felt it would cause to “discontent” to isolate only vulnerable people. But others said that explaining that the rest of the population was building herd immunity for them “will make this acceptable.”This kind of advice, together with the naturally liberalist instincts of Mr Johnson himself, seems to have contributed to the delay in bringing in lockdown.Prof Costello says of the Prime Minister, “He wants people to be pretty free. The thing that they didn’t realise was that every week’s delay on an exponential part of the curve can be a disaster.”Prof Costello points to other countries, such as Ireland, as examples of how more effective actions could have been taken earlier, as does Sir David King, the Chief Scientific Adviser between 2000 and 2007. Sir David says that allowing the Cheltenham races, as pictured below, in the second week of March, for instance, had been a clear error.His own son caught the coronavirus while attending the four-day festival, but has now recovered.“I do know Patrick Vallance rather well and have enormous respect for him and think he’s the right man in the right job. I cannot believe that Patrick, knowing what he knows about epidemics, would have said go ahead with Cheltenham.“I can’t believe that that was the science advice. A big crowd of jostling people all trying to lay bets and collect money at the same time, it’s just the formula for spread.”Sir David’s perception is that, unlike in his time as Chief Scientific Adviser, when he advised and politicians listened, now it is more like the other way round with scientific advisers kept on a tight rein. And having worked with Mr Johnson when he was London Mayor, he says, “It was very clear that he does want people to like him and as a scientist he certainly showed that he enjoyed listening to what I had to say, but I became aware that the next person walking into his office who said the opposite to me would get the same treatment.”Having finally opted for lockdown, the government is now being accused by some academics of having swallowed the Imperial study too readily and depending too much on the mathematical modellers.Professor Richard Sullivan, co-director of the conflict and health research group at King’s College, London, says, “They went from almost nothing, which was \u0027oh, we\u0027re going to ban a few mass gatherings here\u0027 to the full lockdown, just like that.”Prof Sullivan says that he has argued for the modelling to include the unintended consequences of the lockdown on public health, but that his pleas have been ignored. He fears those suffering from non-Covid-19 conditions will now suffer.“The mistake that was made was the models were not red-teamed properly, which means you give it to other people in other areas who model other indirect causes, you say what’s wrong with this model?...They were not exposed to a sufficient critique.”The problem with mathematical modellers, he adds, is that the modelling community in infectious diseases is a very closed and very small community. So if you get it right, of course you get it right, but if you get it wrong you can’t see you’ve got it wrong.”Whether Prof Ferguson at Imperial has got it wrong on Covid-19 remains to be seen, but certainly some of his past pronouncements over pandemics have appeared to fall well wide of the mark.His research that sparked the mass culling of farm animals during the 2001 epidemic of foot and mouth disease was disputed.In 2002 Prof Ferguson got involved in the BSE crisis, which had years earlier seen the then agriculture minister John Selwyn Gummer attempt to reassure the public that it was safe to eat beef by feeding a hamburger to his four-year-old daughter.Prof Ferguson authored a report speculating that BSE in cows and sheep could cause up to 150,000 human deaths: to date is fewer than 200. Three years later he aired the possibility of bird flu leading to 200 million deaths and then said in 2009 that swine flu could kill up to 4 million.The sum total of the death toll for both diseases was in fact around 19,000.Prof Ferguson, however, stands by the integrity of his modelling.As the debate over the justification for the lockdown goes on, now the government is also facing pressure over its insistence that the use of face masks for everyday use by the general public is unnecessary. The official line has been that unless you are in close contact with someone a mask is not going to make much difference and can, conversely, make people less careful about keeping their distance while making them more prone to touching their own masks and faces.But the Government is now considering revising its stance, following a prediction from David Nabarro, the World Health Organisation special envoy on Covid-19, that they could play a role in our eventual exit from the lockdown. He says, “I’m envisaging in the coming weeks and months that as people start trying to get back to what I call the new normal – the Covid-ready normal – they will be wanting to wear face protection.”He says that after the SARS outbreak in Asia “people used to tell me, one of the reasons they wear masks is they want to do everything possible to keep safe. The second reason is to show to others that they’re taking it seriously.”The exit strategy is very much on academic minds. For this part of the process, we should definitely not rely solely on the mathematical modellers, says Robert Dingwall, Professor of Social Sciences at Nottingham Trent University, and an advisor to one of the SAGE sub committees.“There is a space in the policy making that might be occupied by a combination of sociologists, political scientists and historians who have worked on previous pandemics…you could argue there is a gap in the system of expert advice for that kind of input.“Modellers are smart people but they’re mathematicians primarily and that’s why you need to set their advice into a social and economic context. That’s why you need to have an understanding of the real world.“Ferguson for example keeps talking about social distancing as a kind of all or nothing thing. Whereas if we’re going to talk about an exit strategy, there isn’t going to be a VE day where we declare it’s all over.”One problem, he says, is that “the government have ramped up the level of fear to a point where it’s very hard for people to hear the messages about ‘this is the way out’.” He describes the lockdown on parks, for instance, as “cruel and unjust.”“It’s a policy by people like me who live in houses with big gardens.“If the politicians are trying to follow the science, and the science is only giving them a limited range of input, then it might be quite difficult for some of these everyday considerations to get taken more seriously.Prof Sullivan echoes some of those points: I think the fear out there is extraordinary. Now, it’s our view that the fear is out of all proportion to the threat and the risk. There’s been a real perspective loss here.“I keep saying to people we have as many if not more people dying of pneumonia and loads of other conditions. I think life has to start renormalizing again with sufficient care and attention to the vulnerable.”In addition to the search for a vaccine, comprehensive testing of the population so that infected people – and anyone they have had contact with - can remain in isolation, will also be essential. Only then, it seems, can the rest of us – with or without masks – realistically hope to return to something resembling normality.But with the government struggling to even reach its projected target for the end of the month of 100,000 tests a day, that goal feels a long way off, as does a vaccine, which could take a year or even two to produce on the necessary scale. According to some scientists, the only other option might involve us coming full circle.Prof Sullivan says that, even after sorting out testing and the provision of adequate personal protection equipment, “I’m afraid it comes down to this problem of, are we going to wait for two years for a vaccine which may never happen?“Of course not. The British economy and society will be finished by then. So, your only option here is about building up herd immunity.”After all this, herd immunity?But then, as Professor Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer told the media last week, “The thing about scientific advice is that it evolves.”Perhaps Sir Patrick won’t find he has anything to regret after all.  More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"us expert says coronavirus not developed chinese lab","story":"America\u0027s top expert on infectious diseases rejected suggestions the coronavirus could have originated in a Chinese laboratory, slapping down a theory floated by Donald Trump and his allies.Dr Anthony Fauci, whose relationship with the president has appeared frayed as they have presented regular White House briefings together, said scientific research has convinced him it originated in bats and jumped to humans.His comments came as Donald Trump said the idea of it escaping from a laboratory made sense and amid reports that a US intelligence investigation is looking into that theory.Dr Fauci said: A group of highly-qualified evolutionary virologists looked at the sequences in bats as they evolve.The mutations that it took to get to the point where it is now is totally consistent with a jump of a species from an animal to a human.However, asked if the virus could have escaped from a laboratory in Wuhan, China, Mr Trump said: Well, we’re looking at that.  A lot of people are looking at it. It seems to make sense.They talk about a certain kind of bat, but that bat wasn\u0027t in that area. If you can believe this, that’s what they’re down to now, is bats. But that bat is not in that area. That bat wasn’t sold at that wet zone. It wasn’t sold there. That bat is 40 miles away.So a lot of strange things are happening, but there is a lot of investigation going on and we\u0027re going to find out.The Wuhan lab theory has been largely discredited but remained mostly on the fringes until this week.Fox News, the president\u0027s preferred TV network, pushed the lab narrative before Mr Trump and Mike Pompeo, secretary of state, both added their suspicions.Critics have accused Mr Trump of using the theory to step up his attacks on China and ert attention away from his handling of the pandemic in the US, now the worst-hit country in the world.US intelligence agencies will reportedly present their findings on the origins of the disease to the White House in the near future, although sources told Politico they have found no evidence to back up the theory.Mr Pompeo said earlier this week: “We know that the first sightings of this occurred within miles of the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  We know that this, the history of the facility, where there’s high-end virus research being conducted, took place at that site.He added: We know that the Chinese Communist Party, when it began to evaluate what to do inside of Wuhan, considered whether the WIV was, in fact, the place where this came from. And, most importantly, we know they’ve not permitted the world’s scientists to go into that laboratory to evaluate what took place there.An analysis published in Nature Medicine in mid-March said: We do not believe that any type of laboratory-based scenario is plausible.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/17/17/macbook.jpg","title":"apple mac update battery charge life power","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Laptops may not charge up all the way all the timeApple is rolling out a new feature called battery health management that will change how laptops charge themselves.The update will mean that laptops may not charge themselves all the way up all of the time, if the computer believes doing so will protect the life of the battery.It aims to avoid a problem that means fully charging a laptop\u0027s battery puts a strain on it, because of the chemicals inside. Leaving a computer charged up in this way can therefore reduce its capacity, leading the battery life to fall over time.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesInstead, if the computer believes that it is not likely to need 100 per cent battery in the future, it will only charge up some of the way. The computer will show that the battery is full, but it may not actually be.The feature can be turned off and may not be activated in all situations, Apple said. It will also ensure that the battery life is not significantly affected, the company said.Everything you need to know about the new iPhone SEA similar feature is already in place on Apple\u0027s iPhone, and was introduced in a recent update. It means that the phone will learn when it goes on charge at night and when you tend to wake up, for instance, leaving the final bit of charge until it expects you to get up and start using your phone.The Mac update will work in largely the same way, using its history of charging and battery use to notice times when you tend not to need the full battery life. If a computer tends to be used plugged in throughout the day, for instance, it may not charge up its battery fully.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

One researcher said it had the potential to be really, really stunning as it reached its closest point to Earth, in May.The comet that took 100 million years to pass EarthBut shortly after it became clear that the comet was actually distintegrating, getting dimmer as it did.As well as offering a chance to see the comet as it breaks apart, the images may prove useful to the scientists studying the object. Relatievely little is known about the object, which was only discovered at the very end of 2019.Comet Atlas is still heading on its trajectory towards Earth. Its orbit is similar to the famous Great Comet of 1844, and it is thought that the two might both be pieces of what was once a larger comet.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

N95 and medical masks, which offer the most protection and are heavily in demand, should be reserved for health care workers who are regularly exposed to infected patients.A mask is effective only if worn properly, fitting snugly from the top of the nose to below the chin with no gaps. Masks should be worn the entire time you are outside and should not be moved up and down. While no mask is 100 per cent effective, it can help keep both you and others safe when combined with social distancing and regular hand-washing.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHere’s a look at some of the types of masks you might encounter, how they work, what to consider when making your own and the level of protection they could provide.The N95 is the most recognisable and effective mask. Its name means it can block at least 95 per cent of tiny particles — 0.3 microns — that are the hardest to capture. An average human hair is about 70 to 100 microns wide.These masks, which are designed for single use, are made with polyester and other synthetic fibers, including layers of tangled fibers that act as a filter to make it harder for particles to pass through.Make sure there are no gaps between the edge of the mask and your skin. This one includes a nose piece that is moulded to your face. Many health care and other workers do annual fit tests that check for air leakage and ensure that masks are sized and fit properly. (If you have facial hair, you won’t get a proper fit. They don’t fit well on children, either.)Some N95s have exhalation valves on the front, which make it easier to breathe. Those masks are often used in construction. A mask with a valve should not be used in areas that are meant to be sterile, like hospital operating rooms.Medical masks come in a few varieties and are less effective than N95s: some filter as much as 60 per cent to 80 per cent of small particles under lab conditions. When worn properly, they can help prevent the spread of the coronavirus by catching droplets when you cough or sneeze.Medical masks are often made out of layers of breathable, paperlike synthetic fabric that is cut into a rectangular shape and has pleats to help it expand and fit more snugly around your face. They are disposable and designed to be used just once.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailWhile they can protect you from large droplets and splatter, their looser fit is partly what makes them less effective than N95s.With medical masks in short supply, many have turned to making or buying homemade ones. Depending on the fabric and how it’s made, a homemade mask can sometimes protect the way a simple medical version does. And any face covering is better than nothing.Trump: US \u0027king of ventilators\u0027 as coronavirus death toll tops 36,000A good homemade mask uses a material that is dense enough to capture viral particles but breathable enough that you can tolerate it.You can use materials like a heavy cotton T-shirt, flannel or a tightly woven dish towel. Material with a higher thread count – which allows very little light to filter through – will likely offer the best protection.Various patterns for making a cotton mask have spread around the internet. Look for one that has at least two layers of material, comes up over your nose and below your chin and has secure straps.Some homemade masks have a pocket sewn in to hold an additional filter.Coffee filters and paper towels have been tested. One experiment found that two layers of paper towels on their own blocked between 23 per cent and 33 per cent of 0.3-micron particles.People have been experimenting with filtering materials, including air filters and vacuum bags. They can be effective but can present risks. Many are not breathable and may contain harmful fibres that you could inhale. Also, the average person doesn’t need the level of filtration that these materials provide.Make sure there is a layer of cotton or similar material on either side of the filter.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Before long, some balance will have to be struck.”Researchers have argued young people have been found to be less likely to develop severe coronavirus symptoms, but are likely to be among the\u0026nbsphardest hit members of society economically from strict lockdown measures designed to slow the spread of the virus.The report estimated the proposed strategy would result in between 600 and 700 additional coronavirus deaths.Institute for Fiscal Studies\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Frustration that the pandemic we are living through was predictable and preventable,” Mr Jermey writes.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe blunt acknowledgement by Mr Jermey\u0026nbspcomes amid increasing anger at home and abroad over\u0026nbspfailures by national governments to prepare\u0026nbspadequately for\u0026nbspthe infectious disease, which has so far claimed more than 150,000\u0026nbsplives globally.\u0026nbsp​“Humanity’s relentless exploitation of wildlife has been putting us at increasing risk of an event like this for decades. And this knowledge has not been some big secret, despite the rhetoric from various world leaders claiming this pandemic couldn’t have been anticipated,” Mr Jermey writes.\u0026nbsp”The truth is, we knew this was coming.”The message would\u0026nbspappear relevant for successive Conservative governments, which\u0026nbsphave been accused of repeatedly ignoring warnings\u0026nbspwithin “pandemic preparedness” documents over the past decade.To minimise the risk of future pandemics, Mr Jermey\u0026nbspcalls for the international community to focus on better regulation of so-called “wet markets”, such as the one in Wuhan largely considered the epicentre of the outbreak, and a renewed battle against the “illegal and unsustainable” wildlife trade.\u0026nbspOf the latter, Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent and Evening Standard, wrote last week: “From the financing of terrorists like Al-Shabab to the propagation of corruption and smuggling groups, this demand has done untold damage to the African continent.

Following a quick check-up, the crew will be flown by helicopters to Baikonur, from where Skripochka will be taken to Moscow, said Vyacheslav Rogozhnikov, a Russian medical official who oversaw the crew\u0027s return.Morgan and Meir will have to be driven from Baikonur to Kyzyl-Orda, 190 miles away, to board a flight to the US - a strenuous journey made necessary by Kazakhstan\u0027s quarantine measures.On Thursday, the Russian government coronavirus headquarters reported the first contagion at the Star City, which serves as the main hub for pre-flight training of US, Russian and other international crew members of the International Space Station.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

It will also mark the final test before the spacecraft is approved for use, sending Nasa\u0026nbspastronauts to the International Space Station and beyond.Nasa veterans Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley, who both took part in a number of space shuttle missions, will be carried up into space on a Falcon 9 rocket at 4.32am local eastern time, from Kenned Space Center. They will go for an extended stay at the space station, Nasa said, but the precise duration of the mission is yet to be determined.During the mission, they will test all parts of the Crew Dragon capsule, including the launch pad, rocket, spacecraft, and operational capabilities, Nasa said.Lifting off from Launch Pad 39A atop a specially instrumented Falcon 9 rocket, Crew Dragon will accelerate its two passengers to approximately 17,000 mph and put it on an intercept course with the International Space Station, Nasa said. Once in orbit, the crew and SpaceX mission control will verify the spacecraft is performing as intended by testing the environmental control system, the displays and control system and the maneuvering thrusters, among other things.In about 24 hours, Crew Dragon will be in position to rendezvous and dock with the space station. The spacecraft is designed to do this autonomously but astronauts aboard the spacecraft and the station will be diligently monitoring approach and docking and can take control of the spacecraft if necessary.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

By contrast, the new evidence suggests very clearly that the people of Nazareth lived purely Jewish lives – and kept to all the major ritual laws.The area seems to have been actively anti-Roman. In the year 4BC, an anti-Roman revolt is known to have broken out in the area – and rebels attacked the military arsenal and government treasury in the centre of nearby Sepphoris.Indeed, the archaeological investigation revealed that in Nazareth itself, in the middle of the first century AD, anti-Roman rebels created a sizeable network of underground hiding places and tunnels underneath the town – big enough to shelter at least 100 people.Religious Jews saw Roman and Greek influence as a serious and direct threat to their faith. Thus pious religiosity and anti-Roman politics often went together.The new archaeological investigation – the largest ever carried out into Roman period Nazareth – has revealed that Jesus’s hometown is likely to have been considerably bigger than previously thought. It probably had a population of up to 1,000 (rather than just being a small-to-medium sized village of 100-500, as previously thought).No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Field surveys by the archaeologists have revealed that, about halfway between the two towns, there is an abrupt change in the agricultural strategy.The discovery is significant because different Jewish groups took very different attitudes to human excrement. Mainstream religious Judaism took the view that such excrement was unpleasant, rather than ritually impure. Their only prohibition on the subject was that people should make sure that human excrement should be at least four cubits (almost 2 metres) away when prayers were being recited.However, an ultra-religious Jewish sect called the Essenes (and potentially, therefore, other extreme groups) did regard excrement as rituallyspiritually impure and unclean, as well as being merely physically unclean and unpleasant. They took the view that all human excrement must be buried so as not to offend God’s “ine rays of light”.The fact that the people of Nazareth seem to have had a strict prohibition on the use of human excrement as a crop fertiliser implies therefore that they too regarded it as ritually impure, rather than simply unpleasant.It therefore suggests that they were, in some ways, either aligned with aspects of Essene thinking or with the thinking of another similarly hard-line religious movement within Judaism of the first century AD.However, in other aspects of their material culture, the people of Nazareth were totally in line with other, more mainstream forms of pious Judaism.The archaeologists have found numerous fragments of stone bowls and cups in and around Nazareth: a fact that strongly suggests a high degree of traditional religiosity in the town.Religious Jews of the first century AD believed that stone vessels were immune to ritual and spiritual impurity in a way that ceramic and wooden vessels were not.So to keep themselves and their homes ritually clean, they often preferred to use stone vessels.The belief is stated quite clearly in chapter 10 of the Mishnah, the Roman-period compendium of Jewish tradition and law that was later incorporated into the Talmud. Indeed, the use of stone vessels for ritual washing is also referred to in chapter 2 of St John’s Gospel. Frequent hand-washing – after sleeping, before eating bread, before worship – was, and still is, an extremely important aspect of strict traditional Jewish religious life.However, religious Jews of Jesus’s time may also have been reluctant to use manufactured goods that may have been rendered ritually impure during their manufacture: for instance, by having been placed near non-kosher food or near to a dead body or by having been handled by a woman during menstruation.This fear may well be behind the type of ceramics used in Nazareth.Archaeological sites in Arizona threatened by Trump’s border wallWhy archaeological antiquities should not be sold on the open marketArchaeologists have found thousands of fragments of pottery in and around Nazareth. In contrast to the pottery of Sepphoris, however, it is virtually all of one type: a\u0026nbsprough ware, made in a Jewish village called Kefar Hananya, 23 miles to the north of Nazareth. Interestingly, archaeologists have found that the distribution of stone vessels and Kefar Hananya pottery in first-century Palestine seems to correlate. It’s likely that religious Jews were taking no chances with their domestic utensils, and made sure that their pots came from strictly religious Jewish sources that could be relied upon to keep them ritually pure during manufacture.The newly emerging picture of Roman-period Nazareth as a place of substantial religiosity does, however, resonate not only with the emergence of its most famous son, Jesus, but also with the fact that, in the mid-first or second century, it was chosen as the official residence of one of the high priests of the by-then-destroyed Temple in Jerusalem, when all 24 of those Jewish religious leaders were driven into exile in Galilee.Indeed, what are probably priestly tombs have been discovered by archaeologists in and around Nazareth. Remarkably, some of them were even equipped with extremely rare life-size glass versions of the goats’ horn musical instruments – the shofarot, or shofars, that had been used during religious services in the Temple in Jerusalem and which are still blown today during the two most important religious events of the Jewish calendar.Significantly, after the fall of Jerusalem in AD70, when the Romans destroyed the Jewish Temple there, the shofar came for a period to be seen, and blown, as an expression of mourning for the Temple’s destruction.The archaeological investigation in Nazareth will help historians to better understand the ways in which Jesus’s hometown may have helped shape his religious outlook. The gospels of St Mark and St Luke suggest that his views were not popular there – and it may be that what seems to have been the ultra-strict nature of Nazareth’s religiosity had actually pushed Jesus towards a perspective that would perhaps have been more acceptable to less strictly religious Jews, such as many of those living in places like neighbouring Sepphoris.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We are still conducting testing where we can but there is a severe disruption, no question.”The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) said a new self-administered doping test, where athletes are monitored live by a doping control officer, could help protect clean athletes, as the agency tries to ensure no one gets a “free pass” from reduced testing during the pandemic.Clothier said that though current testing limitations give dopers an opportunity to cheat, agencies should be proactive in identifying athletes prone to cheating while also cracking down on the root causes of doping.“One thing that needs to be understood though is testing for us isn’t just a numbers game,” he added. “We use intelligence and investigation methodologies to make sure we are testing the right athletes we need to at the right time.“While our testing activities are reduced at the moment, we are focusing on our priority and high-risk athletes and making sure we can test them as much as possible within the limitations we have.“We’re hoping that we’ll see change around the anti-doping world... where more organisations invest in intelligence capabilities so that they can address the root causes of doping and the people behind doping rather than just using the tests as a facade or a numbers game.”Live Rugby union coverage direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Ben Elliot, co-founder of global luxury concierge company Quintessentially and nephew of the Duchess of Cornwall, was to be first in post.He recalls having “pestered” Michael Gove back in 2016 that the government should create a fund to assist food redistribution. He questioned whether the UK’s commitment to be carbon neutral by 2050 was possible without massive action on food wastage, “the carbon emissions that come from food waste are the equivalent of every third motor car on the road”.The Evening Standard and The Independent’s 2016 Food for London Now campaign played a part in convincing him that something had to be done. “I remember once walking home in London\u0026nbspand seeing bags of food being ushered out of a café, and literally seven metres away there was a group of homeless people. It just seemed mad.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHe tells me, over a crackly conference call line, that as food surplus and waste champion,\u0026nbsphe has spent 13 months working with manufacturers, retailers and households to sign them up to waste less food.He hails charities like the Felix Project, the Evening Standard and The Independent’s campaign partner, for their “clever, simple, straightforward method of taking surplus from retail, manufacturers, hospitality and redistributing it to community groups”.I suggest his role within government is that of a convener and he agrees wholeheartedly. “I have been a cheerleader and an evangelist for charities like Felix to raise their profile and also cajoling retailers, hospitality groups and donors to support them”.Lady Bamford, the businesswoman behind Daylesford Organic and the Lady Bamford Charitable Trust, which supports the Felix Project, confesses to me that she is a huge admirer of his work. “He is one of the most hard-working people I know. Everything he does he believes in passionately, throwing himself in with vigour, empathy and from a genuine belief that it is worthwhile.“His work as food waste champion for the government is just another example of his exceptional work, drawing the attention of all generations to a problem that urgently needs to be tackled, and one that is even more relevant during these times.”“Only in a crisis do things actually change in society”, Mr Elliot adds after a pause. Last week he wrote a letter to all the large supermarkets and retailers asking them to be more flexible about best before dates and to work more closely with redistributors. He uses the example of the NHS Nightingale hospital in east London – “can you imagine how long it would have taken to be built in peacetime?”.According to the Food Foundation, 8.1 million\u0026nbsppeople face food insecurity and three million have already gone hungry since the lockdown. Mr Elliot says that he has heard talk that the number of food insecure people could double if the crisis continues. He also predicts issues with the supply of dairy, fruit and vegetables “because of shortages of workers”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailSo what is the government doing to prepare for this impending hunger epidemic? At the beginning of this month, Defra launched a £3.25m fund to support organisations redistribute 14,000 tonnes of surplus stock around the country. This is in addition to a £15m scheme launched at the end of 2018 to tackle food waste.I ask him if he thinks the government should step in and play a larger role in a sector dominated by charities. “Yes I do”, he says. “What you’ll see is both the DWP (responsible for food banks) and Defra (responsible for food redistribution) working much more closely together.”“And I’ll be lobbying for that”, he adds. Mr Elliot has also been co-chairman of the Conservative Party since July 2019. He predicts that a case will be made for more government funding of organisations like the Felix Project, City Harvest and Fareshare, the three charities that make up the London Food Alliance.Education is also a key battleground against food waste. “I’ve got two young sons,”\u0026nbsphe says.\u0026nbsp“They can both explain to me that there might be by 2050 more plastic in the ocean than fish. When it comes to food waste it is very difficult to have that conversation at a school level.”But in the short term, this is a battle to keep people fed in a country that is facing a historic depression. “There are huge swathes of our population for whom food is not a luxury, It’s a necessity. At the moment there is a public desire to support frontline workers in hospitals, and that won’t go away.”Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastBut he warns: “The size of the problem will be in the wider society dealing with millions of people as opposed to tens of thousands of frontline health workers.”The light at the end of the tunnel for him is the model of the Felix Project and other charities, which receive some government money, work well with big businesses and are also adept at cutting through bureaucracy.“It’s very rare in our society where you see all those parts joining up in a common effort,”\u0026nbsphe says.Justin Byam Shaw, the founder of the Felix Project, writes to me: “The response of voluntary organisations to this growing hunger crisis has been extraordinary.“And in the background all the time has been Ben, persuading the government, cajoling food industry CEOs and arm-twisting donors. He’s one of the secret heroes of this amazing response to what would otherwise have been a major public disaster.”Ben Elliot seems to spend his whole day engaging people and organisations, urging them to change and act faster than before.Will this be enough to stymie the wave of food poverty the government is braced for? He tells me, chuckling: “I’ve bored people into submission, irritated them and just cajoled them, and that’s what I’ll keep on doing.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The initiative will be launched on Monday when the Hubb Community Kitchen plans to start cooking between 250 and 300 meals a day, three days a week.\u0026nbspThe scheme\u0026nbspfollows a Zoom conference call last week, when the duchess talked to women involved in running the kitchen about how they could adapt their service to feed people at a time when social-distancing rules prevent it from opening as normal. Much of the produce will be supplied by The Independent’s charity partner The Felix Project which sources surplus food from cafes, restaurants and supermarkets.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMeghan said: “The spirit of the Hubb Community Kitchen has always been one of caring, giving back and helping those in need, initially in Grenfell and now throughout the UK.\u0026nbspA home-cooked meal from one neighbour to another, when they need it most, is what community is all about.”How to support our campaign“I’m so proud of the women of the Hubb Community Kitchen, and the continued support The Felix Project gives them to carry out these acts of goodwill, which at this moment are urgently needed.\u0026nbspI’m equally moved by the many people who are contributing to campaign to raise money for these vital organisations in the wake of Covid-19.”The meals will be prepared in the cooks’ homes and delivered by another charity, StreetGames, which runs the Fit And Fed campaign that aims to provide nutritious meals for children at risk of going hungry during the school holidays.The Duke of Sussex, who saw the charity’s work during a visit to one of its centres in Streatham last year, put it in touch with the kitchen.Harry and Meghan on Thursday\u0026nbspcompleted two days of volunteering with Project Angel Food in California, helping to deliver food parcels to people in need.The Hubb Community Kitchen was set up in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower disaster in June 2017, when a group of local women gathered in a communal kitchen at the Al-Manaar Muslim Cultural Heritage Centre.The duchess first visited it in January 2018 and has continued to make regular private visits.

Mark Curtin, Felix’s chief executive, said: “The women of Hubb Community Kitchen have stepped up yet again in the face of a global pandemic.“We stand together with all of our partners to get food to people most at risk of experiencing hunger and malnutrition in this time of need.”Evgeny Lebedev, a shareholder in\u0026nbspThe Independent, said: “It is a pleasure to have the backing of the Duchess of Sussex for our campaign.\u0026nbspHer support for the survivors of the Grenfell fire is truly admirable.

They’re also using mobile apps tied to payments, such as Amazon Prime Now, to place delivery or pickup orders for groceries. The Treasury Department may even let people who don’t have bank accounts receive their coronavirus relief checks via mobile-payment services like Venmo.“We shouldn’t be touching anything,” said Richard Crone, chief executive officer of mobile-payment research firm Crone Consulting. He expects contactless payments to grab an additional 10 per cent to 20 per cent of transactions at stores and ATMs as the result of the pandemic. Person-to-person services like PayPal, Venmo and Zelle should benefit as well, Mr Crone said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIt’s easy to see why. Even with retail stores cleaning more often than ever – if they’re open at all – handling cash or touching payment keypads stands out as a major risk. With contactless pay, you link a bank account or credit card to your phone and then tap the device on a contactless reader or hover over it to trigger payment.Already, 27 per cent of US small businesses have seen an increase in customers using services like Apple Pay, according to a survey of 361 companies released in April by the Strawhecker Group and the Electronic Transactions Association. Publix Super Markets sped up its transition to contactless terminals because of Covid-19, according to the company. Starting in early April, consumers at all Publix stores have been able to use services like Apple Pay and Google Pay to check out.“I know a lot of merchants are putting signage up at the point of sale, ‘Please use contactless’,” said Linda Kirkpatrick, a Mastercard executive who works with banks and credit unions.Burger King released a commercial in March to encourage customers to use an order-ahead app to pay at drive-thrus.A couple of weeks ago, retail giant Walmart Inc. tweaked its self-checkout system to go completely contactless when shoppers use Walmart Pay. Previously, you had to touch a “Pay now” button after scanning your groceries. Now, you can read a QR code with your phone to pay. Use of pickup and delivery at Walmart is growing as well.A million doses of coronavirus vaccine could be available by September“You are seeing customers start to use services they weren’t interested in before,” said Molly Blakeman, a Walmart spokeswoman.Many sellers at farmers’ markets have stopped accepting cash, and are instead using apps like Venmo, which is owned by PayPal Holdings Inc. The app got it started as a way for friends to reimburse each other for dinner or for roommates to handle rent.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some are buying items in bulk for the whole neighbourhood and then using Zelle to collect payments. Others are sending cash gifts to relatives for their birthdays.“People don’t want to handle cash, especially at this time, so they are looking to mobile payments as the b,est alternatives,” Ms Fintland said.That said, the coronavirus shutdown has hurt some types of mobile payment services and forced others to adjust.Tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world in maps and chartsWhen can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsListen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastToast Inc., which makes management systems for restaurants, laid off half its staff in April. Earlier this week, Grubhub pulled its 2020 guidance, largely because of the acute situation in New York, where many restaurants have closed. Companies that serve ride-sharing companies, like Stripe and Adyen, may also suffer as usage declines.The industry’s established players are also facing new competition. In March, portable-reader heavyweight Square Inc. rolled out ways for its restaurant owners to offer pickup and delivery options.“We’ve seen so many folks pivoting to online to keep their businesses going,” said Katie Dally, a Square spokeswoman. Independent booksellers and other businesses are offering pickup and delivery too, she said.As more people embrace contactless technology and get used to paying that way, consumer behaviour is going to change for good, experts say.The rush delivery service at supermarket chain Safeway hit 670,000 weekly active US mobile users the week of 29 March, up from fewer than 50,000 in the week of 1 March, according to the analytics platform App Annie. Amazon Prime Now’s Android and iPhone active user base grew 60 per cent, according to App Annie.“It’s behaviour that’s going to stick after stay at home ends,” said Jordan McKee, an analyst at 451 Research. “There will be muscle memory about paying, and consumers will use it going around their daily life.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

was successfully paired with one of two male owls from a New Zealand subspecies.The cross-Tasman relations meant that all subsequent generations of moreporks on Norfolk Island were now a unique hybrid

theres no preventative vaccine for Covid- at the moment.But scientists across the globe are racing to find a jab to stop the spread and treat the sick.Yesterday Britains Business Secretary Sharma said that the government has set up a vaccine task force to accelerate the development of a coronavirus vaccine - one that is hoped to be made available as soon as possible.The task force will be facilitating trials, working in the UK and internationally.He confirmed that the government has green-lighted  research projects - with £m going towards them.He said that we cannot put a date on when we will make a vaccine, but hopes that through the best of British scientic endeavour, it will be available soon.The first human volunteers were injected with an experimental jab in Seattle in mid March.Prof Robin Shattock, head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London, said further human trials could begin in coming months with testing on mice currently looking promising.He told Independent: Currently we have a prototype vaccine in animal models where the early results are encouraging.We are hoping to progress to clinical testing by the summer depending on obtaining sufficient funds for the next stage.Another potential vaccine is being developed by cigarette manufacturer British American Tobacco .The Benson and Hedges maker said on April  it could produce between  to  million doses per week by Junetesting goes well but it will need support from government agencies.The London-listed company says it will begin clinical trials on humans soon and is currently running pre-clinical tests.The treatment is being developed by the companys bio-health ision, Kentucky BioProcessing .KBP previously come up with a drug to combat Ebola.It claims to have found an antibody that appears to fight COVID-, using genetically modied tobacco plants, but needs US drug authorities to fast-track permissions.US drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc is testing an experimental Ebola antiviral therapy, remdesivir, on patients with coronavirus in China and Japan -

Dietmar Hopp - has revealed that a breakthrough could be made in the next six to seven months.Talking to Sport, he said: It has to be tested first with animals then with human beings.But I think it could be available in autumn at the time when possibly the next wave of infections will come.Hopp, having already gained headlines for protests in football stadiums, revealed that the vaccine will not be privatised after German reports claimed US President Donald Trump was looking to secure some of the scientists working on the project.Researchers, like Dr Broderick, and Yuen Kwok-yung, from the University of Hong Kong, predict that the fully formed and licensed vaccine will be available from early summer but it will still take at least one year evenexpedited.”The news comes as the global research community steps up its efforts to halt the fatal epidemic.Teams around the world are working on their own vaccines, a process that typically takes at least a decade.British-America Tobaccos scientic research director Dr David O’Reilly said vaccine development was challenging and complex work, but he believes the company has made a signicant break-through with its tobacco plant technology .Researchers in Australia revealed they had successfully synthesised the virus in the laboratory, using a sample from an infected patient.The sequencing and publication by Chinese scientists of the viral genome in only a few days, compared to the five months it took during the  Sars outbreak, is considered to be a game-changer.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: The UK is one of the first countries to have developed a world-leading test for the new coronavirus.It has similar symptoms to the common cold, making it tricky to identy early.The NHS states the key symptoms are:Doctors may order laboratory tests on respiratory specimens and serum, part of your blood, to detect human coronaviruses.The testing is more likelyyou are suspected of having Mers .The UK government has bought . million antibody home testing kits to ensure more people are tested quickly and simply without having to leave home.On March , , the government announced the tests would soon be available to the masses, including NHS workers.In a press briefing, the government said they would provide Brits with home testing kits, with finger-prick kits that will be available from Amazon and Boots.Patients in hospital are quarantined and treated for their symptoms to try and help their bodies fight off the virus and prevent it spreading.In cases exhibiting pneumonia, around  per cent, patients are given oxygen and sometimes a ventilator.If their lungs become too inflamed then doctors work to relieve the pressure on other organs.In less severe cases patients are given a drip for dehydration or ibuprofen for pain relief while the body fights the infection.These treatments are reportedly effective for the most part.There are currently unveried theories that HIV medication could work too as it allegedly did with the  Sars virus, but it is only suggested for last-ditch compassionate use for extreme cases of coronavirus.Other than treatment, detection, sanitation and quarantine measures are being used to restrict the spread of the virus."},{"url":null,"title":"free paper delivery 6 weeks","story":"This means no one has to miss out on their favourite daily read.Simply head online to delivermynewspaper then search your postcode and choose your local newsagent.Select “The Sun” and let us know how often you would like to receive your newspaper.Finally, fill in your details and click “Send My Vouchers”.Vouchers for  weeks of free delivery will be posted to your address.Take these vouchers with you to your chosen newsagent to claim your free -week delivery.Alternatively, you can get your free delivery vouchers by calling us directly on   .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some are already bust. Le will never be quite the same again.The Treasury is stumping up billions to pay furloughed full-time workers, help the self-employed and offer Universal Credit to the very large number who slip between the cracks.We are piling shedloads on to our already massive national debt. For many firms and iniduals this is a devastating blow from which they may never recover, financially or mentally.Lives lost from delayed emergency care, alcoholism, drugs and domestic abuse have rocketed.Together with fatalities from other causes — mostly poverty and despair — they could dwarf the toll from the virus.Some children’s le chances will be wrecked by a long break from school or, worse, from being cooped up with violent family members.Those who keep their jobs may be forced into severe pay cuts. Costs will spill down through the generations.Not everyone is suffering.Public sector jobs and pensions are secure, for the time being.Some with savings, decent homes and jobs they can do from home might actually be enjoying Easter with their families at their side.Breadwinners forced to stay in instead of eating out or flying abroad will have spare cash in their pockets at the end of the month. And some will have grabbed Rishi Sunak’s offer of  per cent pay to put their feet up at the taxpayers’ expense.But it all adds up to a crimson bottom line that our children and grandchildren will have to meet over decades to come.

But what will remain — and at what cost Downing Street, without its most important figure at the helm, must find a way to save Britain from destitution without being blamed for “putting money before lives”.It is a challenge only a loony Corbynite leftie would wish on their worst enemy.But to govern is to choose.And despite having just escaped his own near-death experience, it is impossible to see it happening without Boris Johnson’s say-so.The PM knows there will be questions to answer once all this is over.They are already coming thick and fast — on testing, NHS capacity and protective equipment for NHS staff.These need to be settled fast — at literally any cost.We will then need an inquiry into the failure of so-called “experts” to see this coming.We will want a detailed explanation from the Public Health England quango which focused costly resources on obesity and ersity, rather than the pandemic they war-gamed four years ago.Why, for instance, were they so slow to allow non-NHS specialists into the fast-accelerating battle against Covid- A gargantuan rise in debt and unemployment. A terrying collapse in tax revenues. A vast Government bailout to save businesses and jobs.It should be a comfort that these same official forecasts also predict a rapid rebound, assuming the lockdown ends and the virus is largely conquered.But eventhat startling optimism — which we struggle to share — is borne out, immense and permanent damage will already have been done. Millions of jobs will have been destroyed, thriving firms bankrupted and a monstrous new debt pile amassed, taking years to pay off. The pain of the austerity era after  will have been a mere taster.It is good at least that Britain now knows this. We hope it sinks in.

There is no longer a risk of it being overwhelmed.This was one of the key reasons for the draconian crackdown — to avoid an unmanageable “spike” in crisis admissions.That risk has diminished.

For example, the majority of the , Domino’s Pizza branches have a high rating – with  earning five stars - but one, in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire has just one.Manjaro’s come in at four or five stars – barring the Manchester branch at two - with the Preston outlet where Tyson Fury recently bought his £ family feast getting a top score.Papa Johns pizza chain has a more mixed bag - with three scoring one and one branch, in Northamptonshire, rating zero.The days of bowling into a McDonald’s or KFC and perusing the meal deals before ordering are obviously over, for now.The Food Standards Agency guidelines say all orders must now be taken remotely, eventhe food is being collected by the customer.When you go to collect, the restaurant should have a queue management system in place and you should only enter the building when you are told the order is ready to collect.Ideally, payment should be taken over the phone or online when you order butthat is not possible, contactless should be used. Takeaways delivered to the door come with their own risks but as long as the driver is following the government guidelines, there should be no issue.“The driver should not be showing visible signs for being infected with Covid-, such as sneezing and coughing,” says Sarah.“They should be clean and tidy with disposable gloves or sanitiser for hand hygiene.“The driver should ensure the m social distancing rule is maintained when making the delivery. This is easier when paying by card and avoiding cash payment at the doorstep.“Any food must be distributed in a way which ensures the food does not become unsafe or unfit to eat, says Sarah.In order to ensure that bacteria and viruses are destroyed in hot food, it should arrive on the doorstep piping hot – at °C or above – and in insulated packaging.Chilled foods must be kept cool during transport, at °C or below.In his latest Talk Radio QA, Dr Hilary Jones said hot food is safe to eat but you should be more cautious with cold.If the food is prepared well, it’s presumably been cooked thoroughly, then the virus will be killed off, he said.You certainly want to be able to trust the restaurant. If it’s salad,it’s cold food, you want to make sure it’s been thoroughly washed and prepared by someone who is wearing gloves.Once the takeaway has been handed over – ideally left on your doorstep to observe social distancing – it’s up to you to minimise the risk.Theof time the Covid- virus lasts outside a human host depends on the surface, with the World Health Organisation reporting survival on plastic and steel for up to  hours and on cardboard for up to  hours.So, while cardboard is slightly less likely to cause cross-contamination, it’s unknown whether it is completely safe.“It’s best to take the same precautions as when bringing home your food shopping,” says Sarah.“Wash your hands for  seconds with soap and water on entering your house. Then unpack the food into your own crockery and throw away the outer packaging. Then wash your hands again.“Don’t forget to sanitise hand touch points in your home on a regular basis such as door handles, taps , light switches and so on.”The coronavirus is sensitive to heat so it won’t survive in well cooked hot food.“If food has been cooked properly - at a minimum of °C for at least two mins -  and delivered in a hygienic manor, above °C, there should not be a risk,” says Sarah.However, Dr Hilary Jones says you might want to consider reheatingyou are not completely comfortable.You don’t know who has touched the packaging, who’s done the delivery, he says. You should take the food out of the packaging and you might want to reheat it. The FSA rating scheme also covers mobile catering businesses and street food traders.Providing you know the name of the vans covering your area, you should make the same checks as you would when ordering from a local restaurant.For new businesses which are not yet on the rating scheme, you should check that they are registered to sell food to the public and ask for the food registration number.To receive The Suns Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If you’ve got a -year-old from London in Bournemouth in the afternoon but he hasn’t got an essential purpose, then they’re easy to spot.”The mob sent emails and texts claiming to be from trusted organisations offering help or tax refunds for those in financial need.They included links to bogus websites where victims were conned into revealing bank or credit card details and passwords.Several arrests have been made in Leicestershire, Dorset and South London.Detective Chief Inspector Gary Robinson said: “We’re cracking down on criminals using the Covid- outbreak to defraud the public.”Lynne Owens, director general of the National Crime Agency, added:“They are seeking to deal drugs in supermarket car parks and to portray themselves as key workers to prevent being stopped by police.”A dealer arrested last week with £, worth of cocaine in his car claimed he was a key worker when stopped in Brecon, South Wales. Benjamin Evans, who admitted possession, was wearing a high-vis jacket and claimed to be heading home from a night-sht.In some areas, the price of cocaine has trebled and dealers are using increasing numbers of vulnerable kids as couriers to satisfy demand.Youth worker Matthew Norwood said the lockdown had made things easier.He added: “Kids are using social distancing as an excuse to prevent police officers asking questions.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But they are privately considering slowly easing off the brake.In the “red” phase, people will still be banned from many things they did before the outbreak, but a number of non-essential shops and businesses would re-open.On “amber”, caution would still be required despite much more economic activity being unlocked.This would be followed by the green light for much of normal le to resume — but with measures still in place to avoid infection.However the old and vulnerable could face indefinite lockdown unless a vaccine is developed soon.Some officials are concerned the over-s and those with poor health may have to be shielded for up to  months, even when many of the restrictions have been lted.An insider said: “It’s going to be a slow path back. But just because we aren’t talking about it doesn’t mean we aren’t thinking about it.”Senior officials are increasingly optimistic deaths and infections have reached their peak due to the NHS working wonders and the “stay at home” message being obeyed by the vast majority. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-DEATHS--APRIL-.jpg stripallw\" data-srcSet\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-DEATHS--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-DEATHS--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-DEATHS--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-DEATHS--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-DEATHS--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-DEATHS--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-DEATHS--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-DEATHS--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-DEATHS--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-DEATHS--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-DEATHS--APRIL-.jpg w w, https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   UK-COVID-DEATHS--APRIL-.jpg w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox  . %E%C svg%E\" SUN readers are today urged to sign a petition calling for our NHS staff to be awarded the George Cross.Yesterday, we backed a proposal by Lord Ashcroft to honour our health heroes with the gallantry gong given for acts of bravery that did not take place in battle.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.”SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking readers to sign the petition online at thesun georgecrossfornhs.But a lting of the lockdown will start onlythat continues, testing targets are met and the prospect of anti-viral drugs is on the near horizon.The first tentative steps are unlikely to be taken before May , according to documents seen by The Sun on Sunday.This would allow small, non-essential shops and businesses to re-open, providing they observed strict social distancing.Low-risk personal activities would be allowed, such as visits to hairdressers and shopping trips providing masks were worn.

We’ve picked up everything from prescriptions and medicine to bread and pints of milk for those who can’t go outside. We get anything people need that is essential.“We’re also involved in distributing parcels from the local food bank and the kids have just had their lunch vouchers, so we’ve been busy getting their bits this week.All of us felt that we couldn’t sit back and do nothing.”Brandon dresses up as Spider-Man on his rounds to put smiles on faces.He said: “This pandemic is the first we’ve been through in living memory and we wanted to show the community there are good people out there who will help those in need.”Recalling a touching message they received from Hampshire, Lee said: “He was lovely and said, ‘I wonderyou could help my father — he’s had a transplant and doesn’t want to go out as he’s self-isolating. He’s run out of hand sanitiser and it’s worrying him’.So one of the team got on to it and left it at his gate. Shortly after, his son rang back and said, ‘Dad’s phoned me and thanks you so much. He sounded so much happier, it’s taken a worry away’.“Things like that make it so worthwhile. We’ve got the ability to make people happy and to make a small dference by people knowing there’s a team out there who are willing and happy to help.”The team have had messages of support from much further afield than Hampshire — including Brazil, the US and Italy, where similar groups have also sprung up.Lee said: “We’re just a group of friends from a little town in Cornwall but somehow people have found out about us and are messaging us from all over the world.That in itself is amazing.”Thank you to CHARLOTTE TERRY for making a hamper for Sarah Whelan to cheer her up.

On the first week of the Easter break he and colleague MICHELLE GARNER were in school every day, plus visiting the homes of vulnerable pupils and delivering hot meals to students who are isolated or cannot make it to school to collect their own. They also collected all of the PPE equipment from their academy and delivered it to help the NHS. Kathryn NelsonI would like to thank NATASHA AMIEE ROSE and all the brilliant hard-working staff at TESCO in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset.

His dad Bernard begins the final one at pm, ready for Finn when he wakes up.So far he has made  and aims to finish his th in the coming weeks.The idea was the brainchild of Benchspace, a shared workspace in Cork forced to close its doors to the public. Organisers appealed via Facebook for printer owners to pitch in.Finn said: “As soon as Dad told me we could do something to help healthcare staff, I really wanted to. Each week we clap for the NHS and HSEand now me and the other volunteers are using our D printers to give something back.There’s people in homes all over the country printing these masks.”With an aunt and uncle both working on the front line, the cause is close to his heart. And Finn, who has a six-year-old brother Devan and nine-year-old sisterIsla, said: “I start as soon as I wake up. Two masks print at a time. The first are finished by .am and I put on the last two at my bedtime.”The masks have gone to Mallow General Hospital in Cork, as well as local hospices and care homes.Finn said: “Initially, I aimed to make . But I quickly went past that and now I’m aiming for .”Bernard added: “When we got him the printer for Christmas, we never imagined it would help our heroic healthcare staff who are risking their lives. We are incredibly proud of what he is doing, along with all the rest of the volunteers involved in this project. It’s important everyone able to does their bit.”Benchspace director David Scannell said they got the idea from a US project launched last month.He said: “So far our army of volunteers have printed over ,, which have been distributed to community organisations including residential care homes, meals on wheels and primary care facilities.“We have over  amazing men and women involved in printing, packaging and distribution.”The headgear, made to a strict design agreed by the Health Service Executive, are collected in batches by volunteers from Blood Bikes South and Southern x Response and taken to a nearby sports centre. There, an assembly line works in line with distancing guidelines.Gloved volunteers sanitise the headbands, cut medical-grade acetate into a visor shape and punch holes in the visors before packing up to five single-use visors and one headband into a bag.The army of home printers produce more than , masks a week between them.Thanks to my friend CLAIRE THOMSON for her much-loved WhatsApp messages and Zoom calls.

They both work for Sainsbury’s and have been doing extra hours for the past couple of weeks, putting themselves at risk of coronavirus to make sure that deliveries go out and the shelves are stocked. I’m so very proud. Love you mostest. Sue LangridgeI would like to give a big well done to my we SANDRA JAMES and all the carers in Newcastle still going out to help the elderly.

Long shts, PPE, poorly patients yet still we stand tall. Wendy Bridie, RLI LancasterI would like to nominate KIMBERLY JAYNE EDGAR as one of our unsung heroes. She had only just moved to Lowestoft from Kent two weeks before the lockdown came into effect. As a registrar key worker she has to ­console the families and register those lost during this crisis. Being new to the area, she only has her sisters for support, both of whom she cannot see. Absolute champion. From Kirsty, Damian and Evie xxI’d like to thank my son, firefighter ELLIOTT BIRD, and brother, fire officer JONATHAN BIRD, for keeping us all safe. From Jacqueline BirdI would like to send thanks to the NHS for the brilliant job they are doing, and also the local shops, chemists and lorry drivers bringing daily deliveries to us. Heroes. Mr and Mrs RichardsonI want to salute my we ANN BATTIMELLI and all the staff at ST LUKES CARE HOME, CAVERSHAM. Not only has she volunteered for frontline care at the home, she thought of the staff when she took in an Easter egg for every one of them. Such a thoughtful thing to do. That’s why I love her so much. Dave BattimelliLet’s give credit to our LOCAL SHOPS and staff who have been such a leline. I hope people remember them in the future when these dficult times pass. Bob Johnson In this time of crisis I would like to say thank you to my local ICELAND supermarket. I live in a flat with my faithful dog and I’m , I have no car, just a bicycle, so carrying a week’s worth of shopping would be nigh on impossible. I also would like to say a big thank you to the delivery drivers, along with the staff working in the store. I also would like to thank the staff at my local PREMIER and CO-OP stores here in Pakefield. Lastly, a big thank you to all the NHS NURSES and DOCTORS who are in the front line of this crisis. Without your dedication no doubt many more people who have survived this virus would not be here today. Colin GrimmerI want to say thanks to unsung hero “JOLIET JAKE BLUES” in his Blues Brothers cop car with a loudspeaker. Over the past weeks he’s spent hours doing pre-arranged visits to care homes throughout Derby and Nottingham – mainly at his own expense, playing familiar music to the ­residents and carers. The reactions are of pure delight and joy. Many residents have been waving from windows or assisted outside. Some have been ­dancing, waving and recalling the words as they sing along. While they can’t have family or friends ­visiting, Jake has brought hope and smiles to so many in this scary situation. He cares so much – he’s one in a million with a heart of pure gold. From Rosalie BrainTEN years ago Kay Symonds was being resuscitated by doctors after collapsing with a massive pulmonary embolism which left her hovering between le and death.To mark the anniversary of her survival, she will lovingly stitch as many scrubs as possible for an NHS nurse — the perfect thank-you for ­saving her le.The owner of Kay’s Dressmaking  Alterations said business was booming until the pandemic.With all weddings and social events on hold, the grandmother of six has postponed making alterations to her racks of bridal gowns. Instead, she is making three sets of scrubs every day, starting work at am.Kay, , said: “Every one of my items is stitched with love — because the doctors, nurses and paramedics who resuscitated me gave me back the gt of my le.“It is overwhelming, the support and thanks I get from the staff who receive scrubs I make. I’m just a little cog but this is my way to give something back.”The former quantity surveyor switched careers to make bridal dresses after her dad was cruelly diagnosed with mesothelioma, a cancer caused by exposure to asbestos.Kay said: “When my dad was diagnosed with cancer in April , the Papworth Hospital staff were amazing looking after him.“I remember sitting in my office thinking, ‘What am I doing ’”So she left work to be by his side and became a dressmaker.“Eight weeks after my father died last year, my brother had a stroke aged . The care he received from the Lincolnshire Assisted Discharge Stroke Service was second to none.“So when I found out doctors and nurses needed help, I didn’t hesitate. As a family we have so much to thank the NHS for.”She vividly remembers what happened to her.“On April  — a decade ago this week — I had a broken ankle and collapsed at home with a pulmonary embolism.“My daughter found me and I was blue-lighted to Peterborough District Hospital, where I was resuscitated a couple of times.“The paramedics who saved my le visited me in the coronary care unit. I am forever grateful.”Three weeks ago, Kay sent her first NHS creations in the post.She soon had  requests from hospitals and nursing homes from Cornwall to Scotland. Kay set up a crowdfunding page and was joined by four seamstresses.“I’ll just keep going,” Kay said. “I’ll never forget what the NHS has done for me.”Help Kay at gofundme f scrubs-fund-fabric-for-nhs.I would like to say a big thank you, from the bottom of my heart, to the staff at COLLEGE FIELDS NURSING HOME, Barry, who are looking after my -year-old mother and other ­residents, some of who, like my mum, have dementia. I visited nearly every day before Covid-. The staff have made it a little ­easier for me to accept that I cannot ­cuddle or kiss Mum, by making her days fun and arranging video calls from ­relatives, and we can still deliver things like flowers etc. They deserve praise and thanks from myself and all the other families. Ann PownerBig thanks to all the NHS WORKERS and CARERS for all their dedication and time. Also thanks to our daughter VANESSA who is a community first responder and helping out the ambulance service by cleaning the ambulance stations at weekends.

Connie  Terry xxxI would like to say a huge thank you to DAIRYFRESH who have been ­giving free milk and bread to the NHS workers twice a week outside St Barts Hospital in ­London. It’s a really kind gesture and a great help. Thanks, guys. NHS workerWe would like to thank our granddaughter KIRSTY-JAYNE GREENHALGH, who is a healthcare assistant at the QMC NOTTINGHAM. She lives with us but has moved out of the family home to keep us all safe. It is very hard not seeing her daily, but she always does what is best for everybody around her. We hope that this Covid- crisis is over very soon. But in the meantime, she makes us so proud. John and Sheila GreenhalghMy unsung heroes are CAROL and MARK BEDOE from Corby in Northants. My we and I are  and I have serious health issues. During these very vulnerable times Carol and Mark have been our “shining lights”, getting in our shopping and checking in daily to see that we are OK. Mark has also been looking after our lawn and hedges, taking a great burden off us. What a comfort to have such kind and caring neighbours who do this out of kindness while seeking no reward. God bless them both. Angus DarwinI want to thank CLAIRE HUGHES and her amazing team – SELINA, SUSIE, MEGAN, STACEY, DEB and VALERIE – at the Sofea Community Larder Didcot. They are providing thousands of ­emergency food boxes to people in Oxfordshire. Around , went out last week. These ladies are the kindest, caring people you will ever meet. Sofea does so much for the people of Oxfordshire. Their whole team at the warehouse work seven days a week to make thousands of boxes – they’re our angels. The food is keeping my family fed. Thank you. Emma xTo my very good friend T, who works in a home in Dover, Kent, specialising in dementia care for the elderly. You do an incredible job, putting yourself at risk every day to look after the vulnerable, to hold the hands and calm the nerves of the ones who need you.

At least  NHS staff have died from the virus so far.One official said: “Masks sometimes need to be changed ten times a sht, and several gowns need to be worn as staff move from wards and bays. You can’t wear the same equipment for a -hour sht.”Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick told yesterday’s No briefing the Turkey lt was a “very large consignment” of PPE to meet the “short supply” for workers in , healthcare settings.He said: “They should be assured we are doing everything we can to correct this issue, and to get them the equipment that they need.”Meanwhile, Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, made a thinly-veiled attack on the Government over Friday’s changed guidance.He said ministers should instead stick to PHE rules agreed two weeks ago with the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and the Royal College of Nursing.He added: “I’m a doctor. I’ve worked on the front line for many years and can assure you for me and my clinical colleagues, this is very personal. These are my friends, my extended family.”Panicked ministers have drafted in the boss of the  London Olympics to be a PPE czar.Lord Paul Deighton will take charge of scaling up production and co-ordinating distribution.Visors, gowns, gloves, safety boots and chemical suits are all needed in hospitals and care homes.Health Secretary Matt Hancock likened the role to Beaverbrook’s appointment to spearhead aircraft production in World War Two.Mr Hancock said his colleague would “bring renewed drive and focus to coordinate this unprecedented peacetime challenge”.Lord Deighton added: “This effort calls for exceptional teamwork and I am confident that together we will rise to this challenge.”The position is unpaid and he will work across Whitehall departments.Top-end firms including Burberry, Barbour, Louis Vuitton and Philip Treacy have all said their manufacturing equipment could be used in the effort. Unions said their members may have to think twice about workingequipment isn’t up to standard.Sara Gorton, Unison head of health, said: “These are worst-case scenario measures, which staff hope their organisations won’t have to implement.“No part of the NHS should use this move as an excuse to ration supplies of gowns when they still have stocks. That would cause a damaging breakdown of trust at a time when staff are working under intense pressure.“Health managers must be truly honest with staff and their union reps over the weekend.“If gowns run out, staff in high-risk areas may well decide that it’s no longer safe for them to work.”Advice from the Royal College of Nursing is their members should refuse to treat patients as a “last resort”not handed adequate PPE.Prof Neil Mortensen, president-elect of the Royal College of Surgeons, said Friday’s guidance was deeply disturbing and issued without consultation.Yesterday, we backed a proposal by Lord Ashcroft to honour our health heroes with the gallantry gong given for acts of bravery that did not take place in battle.A No spokesman said: “The NHS is doing a fantastic job and the nation will want to find a way to say thank you when we have defeated this virus.”SAS hero Andy McNab added: “The award of a George Cross would show an emotional appreciation.”We are asking readers to sign the petition online at thesun georgecrossfornhs.He said: “The new guidance implies that, even in the operating theatre, surgeons and their teams may not require proper PPE. This is simply unacceptable.”He said that like all doctors, surgeons are committed to their patients and “many will put themselves in the line of fire”. He added: “If fluid-repellent gowns or coveralls are not available, then surgeons should not risk their health.”Meanwhile, a mother has expressed fears her nurse daughter could die due to a lack of PPE.The unnamed mum said her daughter — a young mother who works on a Covid- ward — came home from work in tears.The mum said: “She told me she was frightened that she will never see her children grow up.“She said, ‘Mum,I have to go on a ventilator, only put me on onethey know I’m going to come out of it. I want to be alive for my babies.’”The mum added: “Several days ago they only had two masks left on her ward. The next day they changed their policy and staff must now wear these flimsy tie masks.“Staff have said they will provide their ownthe NHS won’t give them but they have been told they are not allowed. It is devastating. I don’t want my daughter to go to work but she’s a nurse — it is her job to care.”Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves has written to Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, to raise concerns about the shortage.She said the Government must “harness the willing and talents of manufacturers” to increase supplies.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Weaposve had billions in funding for businesses, promises on testing and ventilators, new aposNightingaleapos field hospitals built in weeks, and help for the NHS and social care. Many of these announcements have been made at the daily  Downing Street press conference. But not all the utterances at those pm briefings have been quite what they were cracked up to be. Sometimes, journalists and the general public come away from the press conferences without having been given all the facts, which only emerge some time later on.So in the interests of public duty, weaposve analysed seven pledges that were made either in No, or by the government more widely, that didnapost quite happen as advertised. Ministers are of course working in unprecedented times, and some things theyaposre going to get wrong. But itaposs important to know when something hasnapost quite met the grade. . , tests per day A government statement on March  said testing for coronavirus would be ramped up to , a day, a level expected to be ready within four weeks. But at no point did the number top , - despite No claiming capacity had risen to , by April . The failure prompted furious recriminations, with Downing Street saying it was clear the NHS and Public Health England should fill capacity - but insiders blaming bureaucracy and poor planning for labs on the go-slow. Health Secretary Matt Hancock incorrectly claimed the target was set for the end of April, and superseded by a new target to hit , by the end of the month. But with testing still below , a day with two weeks to go, that , target looks like it could be in doubt.  . , tests per day... On March , the Prime Minister claimed the UK would be going hopefully very soon up to , per day.But Boris Johnson didnapost say when or how, and his pledge has never been repeated. Questioned afterwards, the government said the ambition remained but there was no set date for it to happen. ... And the millions of failed antibody tests The , included both antigen tests, which showyou currently have Covid-, and antibody tests. Antibody tests might showyouaposve been infected in the past and have some immunity. On March , Boris Johnson claimed the finger-prick devices would be as simple as a pregnancy test and have the potential to be a total gamechanger. But none of them have yet been approved for mass use, and many have failed completely, giving  results. On March , National Infection Service director Sharon Peacock said .million of antibody tests had been ordered - and she expected them to go through the approval process by the end of the week. This did not happen. The government has ordered several dferent designs of antibody test, none of which yet work. No refused to say where they were ordered from, but said it aposdoesnapost recogniseapos claims it blew m on tests that donapost work.  . aposAll key social care workersapos getting a test The lack of testing for NHS staff put the government in the firing line - so you can understandministers wanted to get ahead of the criticism. And on April , Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced: I can announce today we have capacity for all key social care staff and NHS staff who need to be tested. But while it was great news at last for NHS staff, there was a crucial word in the statement - key. While all NHS staff with symptoms could get tested, the same was not yet true at that point of all staff in care homes. The discrepancy prompted fresh claims that social care staff were being treated like second-class carers.At the time of Mr Hancockaposs announcement, not only could they not all get a test - they also faced new residents coming in from hospital without being tested either. Both those situations were remedied the next week. But care home deaths still arenapost included in daily statistics, which means they risk becoming a forgotten factor of the outbreak.. aposNew proceduresapos on the right to say goodbye Matt Hancock pledged to end the indignity of coronavirus victims dying alone due to isolation rules. The Health Secretary announced on April : Iaposm pleased to say that working with Public Health England, the care sector and many others, we are introducing new procedures so we can limit the risk of infection while wherever possible giving peopleaposs closest loved ones the chance to say goodbye. He highlighted the tragic case of -year-old Ismail Mohamed Abdulwahab, whose death alone made me weep. But while no-one could argue with the principle Mr Hancock was trying to achieve, it emerged these new procedures were largely not new rules on April . They were more of an order to obey rules already in place.  Both the care sector and hospitals had already been sent Covid- guidance saying visits should not take place - with an exception for people in end-of-le care. But government sources admitted the guidance wasnapost being adhered to, forcing Mr Hancock to make a new statement. The advice for hospitals had been issued on April . It said: Visiting is suspended with immediate effect and until further notice. The only exceptional circumstances where one visitor - an immediate family member or carer - will be permitted to visit [include]: The patient you wish to visit is receiving end-of-le care.” The guidance for care homes was issued on April . A new aposaction planapos for care homes on April  simply reinforced the fact visits can be paid for end-of-le care.  . The aposfirst of thousandsapos of new ventilators On March , Michael Goveannounced the first of thousands of new ventilator devices will roll off the production line on the weekend, and be delivered to the NHS next week. But while , of the Penlon ventilators were indeed ordered, Mr Gove did not clary exactly how many would roll off the production line that week. The next day, the government claried the initial number was in fact in the region of . Officials insisted potentially hundreds more could arrive in the weeks afterwards. The Penlon devices were part of a ventilator challenge urging UK firms to produce hastily-designed breathing apparatus.However, unlike orders for entirely new ventilators from firms like Dyson, the Penlon devices were a re-working of a design of ventilator already in use. As of April , itaposs not known that any other models from the UK challenge have yet been approved for use.. , in a week - and more ventilator questions Questioned on April , Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there should be another , ventilators in the next week. A week later, Downing Street said the figure had been . Supporters of the government would say the exact number doesnapost matter when, as of April , the government insists there is plenty of ventilator capacity in the NHS. But there are more discrepancies in the numbers, and critics would say they raise questions over the overall strategy. For example, Mr Hancock was originally hoping to raise the nationaposs , ventilators to , - but revised the figure down to , after lockdown measures began working. A few weeks ago, government officials told the Mirror there were , ventilators in place, , more aposoff-the-shelfapos models on order - and plus any from the UK challenge. Yet on April , Downing Street said that while the number in place was now ,, just , were on order. Where did the other , on order go  We donapost know.  . A badge for carers Amid negative news stories about the governmentaposs response on social care, Matt Hancock announced on April  a badge for care workers. This badge will be a badge of honour in a very real sense, allowing social care staff proudly and publicly to identy themselves, just like NHS staff do with that famous blue and white logo, he said. I know that many businesses will want to offer the same recognition and benefits as they do wonderfully to the NHS.

Private email and phone conversations are detailed in the run-up to the  election. One staffer, responding to Mr Corbyn’s surprise surge in the polls, is reported saying: “Opposite to what I had been working towards...”  To avoid detection, the members of the group are said to have met secretly away from party HQ at Ergon House, another party building in Westminster. One MP involved in election strategy said: “We were cheated out of Government by people we paid very well, with members’ cash, to get us into office.” The report, which has been blocked by party lawyers but viewed widely on social media, is seen as a major test of Keir Starmer ’s pledge to restore unity after years of bitter faction fighting.Named staff have been targeted with intimidating messages and death threats, according to the GMB union, which represents head office workers.  Labour ’s former deputy leader Tom Watson is not referred to in the report but some MPs believe the group was plotting for him to take over.The explosive allegations threaten to intensy an exodus of left-wing party members which began in protest at Mr Starmer’s election as leader.

Health Secretary Matt ­Hancock proudly announced that although they wouldn’t be getting any more protective equipment, he was sending each of them a lovely badge that says “CARE”. This is what they have been crying out for. Gowns and gloves stop you getting horribly sick but they’re BORING. Other countries have tried to help their medical staff by testing them for the virus. But what use are teststhere’s no badge  This is why in Germany, care workers are all protesting, saying: “The tests might keep us alive butwe haven’t got a badge, is there anything to live for anyway ” Next week Matt Hancock will be even more generous to our nurses. If they’re still working as hard, instead of face masks, he might send them each a beer mat with ‘‘Angel” written on it that they can keep forever. Then,a doctor has completed a -hour sht and doesn’t complain about not having enough masks, he’ll get a fun helium balloon, like the sort you get when you’ve had a baby. Instead of “It’s a girl” or “It’s a boy”, it will have “It’s a knackered doctor” on the side. This will even be practical, as the balloon can be used when there’s a shortage of ventilators.  Patients can suck in the helium which will not only help them to breathe but also ask for paracetamol in a funny high-pitched squeak, lting the spirits of everyone in the ward. Although the staff say they haven’t got enough protective equipment, Matt Hancock says this is because the nurses waste them by changing too often. This was clearly the problem all along. The nurses keep trying on dferent outfits until they find the right style of plastic gloves to go with their skin shade. Or they complain, “This patient coughed over my gown so now it clashes with my face mask”, and get changed yet again. Hopefully the medical staff will change their attitude and realise now is not the time to worry about looking smart.  Matt Hancock also said he was delighted with the way we cheer the staff every Thursday and was “proud that health workers are held in such high esteem”. The Conservatives have always been like that, cheering health workers. For example, they cheered them when the Bill was passed to prevent their pay rise. “Hoorah, our health workers will stay broke and have to go to the food bank, hip hip hooray”, they cheered.

On Thursday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced that the country would need to stay at home for a further three weeks. But there’s thought to be some disagreement in the Cabinet over whether lockdown restrictions should be lted on May  or whether they should remain in place into June. The first scenario would mean restrictions are lted earlier, in the hope it would cause much less damage to the economy – but would risk a second virus ‘peak’. Butlockdown is extended into early summer – it is expected to push numbers of coronavirus cases right down – but would risk further damage to the economy. It’s believed some ministers are unhappy that there has not been a proper debate about the two options, according to the Daily Mail. Scientists say extending the lockdown into the summer would drastically reduce transmission rates and the ‘extremely low’ level of cases would make it easier for health officials to manage the pandemic.  But this approach means the economy would continue to stall. Meanwhile, Tory former party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said the Government should stop treating people like children by refusing to discuss exit strategies for ending the lockdown. He told the Times: The Government is going to have to accept and admit we are coming out of lockdown. We need to trust the British people and not treat them like children. We must respect their common sense. They need to know that the sun is rising at some point in an economic sense.  Labour leader Keir Starmer has claimed an appropriate exit strategy from lockdown is ‘in limbo’ while Boris Johnson recovers from coronavirus. The Prime Ministeraposs spokesman said that claim was just wrong. Keir Starmer said ministers are failing to take decisions on when and how tothe UK to normal le - and suggested the government has not acted “quickly enough” throughout the crisis. He added: “I suspect, although I donapost know, that  Dominic Raab  is just reluctant - he probably does know that itaposs time for an exit strategy - but heaposs probably reluctant to sign it off without the Prime Minister and I think thereaposs a bit of that in the mix.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mps demand answers tory donor","story":"NewsMPs demand answers after Tory donor hired by Government as coronavirus loans advisorChancellor Rishi Sunak hired ex-boss Richard Sharp who runs a firm which makes money helping struggling firms get access to cash, all of which MPs have deemed a conflict of interestShareCommentsByAndy Buckwell:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsFormer Goldman Sachs banker Richard Sharp has been hired as a Government adviser on how coronavirus business loans should be dished out\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - politicsSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

The move has led to accusations that Chancellor Rishi Sunak ’s appointment of ex-boss Richard Sharp could cause a potential “conflict of interest”.The former City banker is chairman at Roundshield, a firm that makes money helping struggling firms get access to cash. One financial expert told us: “The appointment will give him a privileged insight into the market where his business operates – as well as knowledge of government thinking competitors would love. “I believe it is a conflict of interest.” Ex-shadow chancellor John McDonnell is among MPs infuriated by the move. He said: “It is an extraordinary ministerial decision and needs explaining how on earth it cannot represent a serious conflict of interest.” Multi-millionaire Mr Sharp, , has donated £, to the Tory Party in the past. He is on the board of right wing think tank the Centre for Policy Studies. He also owns % in a drugs company linked to the testing of potential coronavirus vaccines. He was Mr Sunak’s boss and mentor when the Chancellor worked as a banker at Goldman Sachs. His new unpaid role will involve sorting out the chaotic Coronavirus Business Interruption Loans Schemewhich has so far dished out cash to just , firms forced to furlough staff or stop trading, despite , inquiries.It’s not the first time Mr Sharp – once an advisor to Boris Johnson as London mayor – has been caught up in controversy. In , he was appointed to the Bank of England’s powerful Financial Policy Committee– and then joined Roundshield, fuelling questions over a conflict of interest.

A government adviser has told the Sunday Times that preparations to leave the EU sucked all the blood out of efforts to ensure the UK could cope with a severe disease outbreak.The anonymous source says this is despite a pandemic having been considered the most serious possible threat to the nation for many years. It was once considered a top priority and was well-funded until austerity cuts were brought in after , they say. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here “We were the envy of the world... but pandemic planning became a casualty of the austerity years when there were more pressing needs,” the source told the Sunday Times. A damning investigation by the paper also alleges that training to prepare key workers for a public health emergency was put on hold for two years, while contingency planning focussed on the possibility of crashing out of the EU. The government was reportedly warned three years ago that the NHS would be quickly overwhelmed in the event of a severe disease outbreak. A major exercise testing the UK’s ability to deal with a pandemic - codenamed Cygnus - exposed “terrying” failings in . Ministers were told that hospitals would rapidly run out of intensive care beds, mortuaries would be overwhelmed and doctors would be forced to deny frail patients critical care. A report on Cygnus’s findings highlighted problems delivering protective equipment such as masks and gowns to health workers, an issue which has been frequently raised by medics battling Covid-. It suggested that health bosses would have no choice but to “switch off” large parts of the NHS. However, a list of recommendations to address these risks was never implemented.  It has been claimed that stockpiles of personal protective equipmenthad dwindled and expired after they became a low priority during the years of Tory austerity. Despite this, some , items of PPE were sent to China to help battle Covid-.

Housing and Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick announced in todayaposs daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing very large consignment of personal protective equipment - including , gowns - is due to arrive in the UK from Turkey tomorrow. But the NHS is currently using , gowns a day - meaning the new shipment will last just days. Earlier, Rachel Harrison, national officer of the GMB, said the union raised critical protective equipment supply issues with the Government more than a month ago. It took until last Friday for ministersapos PPE plan to be published, and itaposs falling apart after just a week. It is key workers on the front line who are paying the price for this litany of failure. It appears Government guidance is being hastily redrawn based on availability, not on evidence or best practice. This is downright dangerous territory and one that will amply the concerns of NHS staff. The Health Secretary now has serious and urgent questions to answer. Trust is draining away. He must urgently explain how this apparently non-clinical decision was made to downgrade public health advice in apparent contravention of global standards and previous advice. GMB wonapost tolerate a situation where our members are pushed on to the front line without the basic kit they need to do their jobs safely. NHS and ambulance staff will now face unacceptable risks as a result of gross ministerial incompetence. We wonapost let this go unchallenged and will now review the steps we need to take protect our members.Unite assistant general secretary Gail Cartmail said: The continued lack of PPE is a national scandal and the Governmentaposs litany of broken promises over the last month is shameful. The public is looking on aghast as brave doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers are risking their lives to provide care to very sick patients - yet they donapost have the necessary protection to carry out their roles. Health Secretary Matt Hancock needs to sort out the logjam in PPE supplies urgently, otherwise he may have to consider his position as this situation canapost continue, as health professionals would be quite right to decline to put themselves in danger. This would go against every instinct in their body and every tenet of their professional training, but already the public is very alarmed at the rising toll of NHS staff who have died due to coronavirus as they have battled the pandemic. We are not just talking about NHS staff in hospitals, but those working in the community, such as health visitors and community nurses, and those employed in social care settings, such as care homes.

Some are raising huge sums for the NHS, while others are using their lockdown time to serve their communities. A group of doctors who were distressed at the lack of PPE available to frontline NHS staff in hospitals have teamed up and raised almost £million – and are supplying the protective gear themselves. Their fundraising effort, called Masks for NHS Heroes, is backed by actor James McAvoy and has meant more than , surgical masks, gowns and visors have been delivered to hospitals across the UK. GP Dr Mona Barzin, who started the group with Dr Salaj Masand, Ravi Visagan and Naveen Anandakumar, said: “It has just exploded. Our initial target was £, and we thought that was unachievable. We never imagined it would get this big, it has been incredible and very overwhelming. “For all of us, this is quite personal. We are all health workers and are continuously in contact with everybody who works within the NHS. We hear all sorts of stories about the lack of PPE and the fear and anxiety. “If we can save even a few lives, it is definitely worth it.” Courier company DHL is chipping in by delivering all the PPE free of charge. Dr Barzin said: “They pick up the PPE directly from the plane and it goes straight out to the hospitals.”  Meanwhile calls were growing for Captain Tom Moore to be knighted yesterday as he issued a rousing message of hope to the nation, declaring: “Tomorrow will be a good day.”The -year-old war veteran, who has nowraised almost £million for the NHS, admitted he is “thrilled” with his fundraising efforts.He originally aimed to raise just £, for NHS Charities Together by completing  laps of his garden before his th birthday on April . Speaking exclusively to the Sunday People, he said: “I am absolutely thrilled that we have all raised over £million for our beloved NHS. “They have done incredible things for me and my family and I am glad that I have been able to give something back to them, especially at this deeply challenging time.”  He then sent his words of hope out to Britain, saying: “My message to the nation right now is, tomorrow will be a good day. “We will get through this and come out of it stronger, more united and ready to face any challenge together.” Capt Tom, who walks with a zimmer frame, completed his challenge at his home in Bedfordshire on Thursday. The money he raised will be spent on wellbeing packs for NHS staff and for kitting out rest and recuperation rooms. It was also announced that Capt Tom will help open the newest NHS Nightingale hospital as a “guest of honour”.He will welcome staff to the new coronavirus field hospital in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, next Tuesday via video link from his home, NHS England confirmed.Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick shared the news at today’s Downing Street press briefing, saying: “We have all been humbled by the gestures, large and small, by people across the country to show support for those working so hard to protect the NHS and save lives. None more so than Captain Tom Moore. I can’t think of a more worthy person to be the guest of honour.”  A kind-hearted teenage boy is leading an army of volunteers to help vulnerable people get essential items in isolation. Ben Thornbury, , from Malmesbury in Wiltshire, has set up a coronavirus advice and support website, on top of his school work, to help those in need. The website coordinates volunteers and matches them with a person who needs help getting essentials. Sixty-five volunteers have registered so far and hundreds more are waiting to join in his small rural town. The schoolboy – who is helped by neighbour Julie Taylor,  – said: “There was no system in place at the time in Malmesbury, so I needed to try and get something going ready to help the self-isolated people. If someone needs a prescription picking up, I will receive an email and then I’ll coordinate a volunteer on that list. “I’m so happy I’m able to use my time in lockdown to help.” A pilot who lost his dream job when Flybe went under is now working as a Tesco delivery driver, to help keep supermarket shelves stocked.  Dad-of-one Aaron Leventhal, , had dreamed of being a pilot as a child and spent ten years training. He worked with Flybe for just  months before the airline went bust – so he decided to turn his misfortune into a positive. Aaron, from Swansea, said: “I was absolutely devastated at first. This had been a dream of mine for years and it had taken a lot of hard work and dedication to train. “But in situations like this, you have to show resilience and spirit. I’m now helping keep food supplies up in supermarkets. I feel a real sense of pride that I’m doing my share in helping the nation.” Former soldier Aaron used his HGV licence he got while in the army – and has been working night shts for the last week.  A menswear designer to the royals is now making luxurious scrubs for medics out of high-end Swiss cotton fabric usually used in £ shirts. Emma Willis – who designs shirts for Prince Charles, actors Benedict Cumberbatch and Daniel Craig, and model David Gandy – got her furloughed staff to help out. Emma, from Gloucester, says the scrubs are better suited to current working conditions than the polyester mix normally given to medics. Because doctors and nurses are wearing so much PPE and working such long shts, they are sweating much more and cotton is a more breathable material. She added: “As of last week, we have turned our cutting tables and sewing machines to the production of NHS hospital scrubs using the Swiss cotton we have in stock.” Emma hand-delivers the new scrubs every evening to critical care units in Cheltenham and Gloucester.She came up with the idea after losing a friend to coronavirus and said: “We’ll keep making these scrubs until we’ve fulfilled all the need.” "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus vaccine ready august worlds","story":"NewsCoronavirus vaccine ready by August as worlds largest human trial kicks offHuman trials begin next week with scientists at Oxford University aiming to release a Covid- vaccine by August this year, bringing hope to millionsShareCommentsByGeraldine McKelvieDan Warburton:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video government-announce-vaccine-task-force-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-vaccine-ready-august-worlds-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Up to  people have ­volunteered for the project, which is led by Oxford University and will test four drugs. They include the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, an anti-inflammatory drug, a steroid and an anti-retroviral drug that is normally used to treat HIV. The Recovery trial, which takes in  UK hospitals, will kick off within days and is due to wrap up in August. Similar trials under way in the US and Europe have a few hundred ­patients in total. Key Government adviser Sir John Bell, who is part of our vaccine taskforce, said: “If we can see ­evidence of a strong immune response by the middle or the end of May, then I think the game is on. “Then, of course, there is the massive issue of how you manufacture at scale many billions of doses.” Professor Peter Horby, another vaccine expert, added: “The UK is leading the global fight against the pandemic.“We’ve set up this trial in ­record time. It’s the biggest trial in the world and realistically by June or July we will get a very clear signal on whether the drugs are effective.” Drug companies and universities across the globe are racing to develop a Covid- vaccine. There are now at least  efforts under way, according to the World Health Organisation.

You can only prove that a vaccine works by appropriate clinical trials. There is a history of vaccine trials showing absolutely no effect. “There are even some historical trials where the vaccine didn’t prevent the disease, it actually made it worse.

After a year which came close to her “annus horribilis” of , Her Majesty has  put personal woes to one side, leading from the front as we languish in lockdown. Where there has been fear, Elizabeth has brought courage. With reassuring calmness, she has lted our spirits. Yes, we may be in times of darkness, but brighter days lie ahead. The Queen, who will be  on Tuesday, has united the country once more – as she has done so many times in her -year reign. But there will be no great birthday fanfare. Traditional gun salutes in royal parks were cancelled and while public buildings can fly the flag they are not forced tosocial distancing rules prevent it. The Palace said: “Her Majesty was keen that no special measures were put in place to allow gun salutes as she did not feel it appropriate in the current circumstances.” A social media post will mark the day on Tuesday, but any phone or video calls with family will be private. Her Majesty’s response is in keeping with the stoicism and sheer common sense she has shown after a punishing period which tested her resolve. Last year was especially dficult for her husband Prince Philip after a car crash. Then her son Prince Andrew became further embroiled in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal. This year started on a grim note too when grandson Prince Harry and his we Meghan Markle withdrew from royal le. When heir to the throne Prince Charles went down with Covid-, the Queen could have been forgiven for wondering when her family’s wretched fortunes would turn around. But it was the precise moment she turned her thoughts to the people of Britain. In an extraordinary address to an apprehensive nation, the Queen spoke with calm authority and soothing sincerity.  She said the UK “will succeed” in its fight against the virus. Invoking the Vera Lynn song, she said: “We will be with our friends again, we will be with our families again, we will meet again.” The TV address was seen by  million people. A royal source tells the Sunday Mirror: “You only have to look at her speech to realise,it was ever in doubt, how much she means to the nation.”  Royal biographer Penny Junor adds: “When in times of crisis, the Queen speaks for us and expresses and calms our anxieties. “She will have been very worried about Charles when he got the virus. It can strike perfectly healthy people. One minute they have got it mildly and the next minute, they are rushed into intensive care.” Ms Junor spells out how well the Queen has handled her family’s recent troubles. Prince Philip crashed his car on the edge of the Sandringham estate, injuring three people, at the start of . Just  hours later the Duke of Edinburgh was criticised for not wearing his seatbelt or offering a swt apology.  Eventually the -year-old surrendered his licence. Ms Junor says: “It would have taken away his independence and been awful for him. There was worry about his wellbeing and about the other people in the car. Yet the Queen seems to have sailed through that.” Last autumn, Prince Andrew, often referred to as the Queen’s favourite son, gave a “catastrophic” TV interview about his association with Jeffrey Epstein. The US tycoon killed himself while held in jail on sex trafficking charges. And this year, Prince Harry decided to leave the UK for a le in America with we Meghan and their son Archie.  A well-placed royal source reveals: “Privately the family were very, very worried about the tumultuous series of events, which really did threaten the very institution. “However, using a very select series of advisers, as well as Charles and grandson William, it was handled in-house without need for the tantrums others had been throwing.” Another source close to Buckingham Palace says: “The Duke of York is largely out of the picture and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are being handled by an American PR company who appear to be drip-feeding publicity stunts. The Queen is behind the real business. Using very few words to rightly heap praise on our NHS and the key workers keeping the country moving forward.” Her Majesty is no stranger to scandal and turmoil in The Firm, as Ms Junor recalls.  She says: “The year  was famously her annus horribilis. “Andrew Morton’s book about Diana came out, three of her four children’s marriages were falling apart. Princess Anne orced, Fergie and Andrew separated, Fergie was photographed topless having her toes sucked, then Windsor Castle caught fire. That was a pretty grim year.” A rare “public fallout” came when the Queen appeared to misjudge the nation’s mood after Princess Diana died in August . The monarch was criticised for initially choosing to stay at Balmoral with William and Harry. Ms Junor goes on: “I think the reason the nation was so lost when Diana died was because the Queen was up at Balmoral looking after her grandchildren, rather than looking after the nation. We take leadership from her. With the coronavirus, this is exactly what she has been doing, she has shown fortitude and given us all a feeling that we’re not alone.” "},{"url":null,"title":"i turned detective prove best","story":"NewsI turned detective to prove my best friend trashed home during break inEXCLUSIVE: Caley Robinson knew that a break-in to her home was not a random affair and after two stressful years she was able to prove that it was actually her best pal KatieShareCommentsByJudy BroadbentGrace Macaskill:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsKatie and Caley in happier days \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailCruel intruders bit off more than they could chew when they trashed the home of mum Caley Robinson.Her TV, coffee machine and, oddly, rugs were taken.But this was no ordinary break-in. It happened on no ordinary day. And the sheer wanton destruction and vile state the house was left in convinced Caley it was by no means a random raid. Through sheer dogged detective work over two long and stressful years she would finally prove that her former best pal Katie Morrison, , was behind it. Caley even uncovered a long history of deception in which she had been conned out of thousands of pounds. Her nightmare began on the day she had organised a fundraiser in memory of beloved brother Tom, who was only  when he died in a moped crash. Jobless Katie, her brother Christopher and boyfriend David Rodericks struck while Caley was out. The entire house – even her two kids’ stuff – was a mess. Clothes were cut up, wardrobes and drawers were ransacked, the bathroom was trashed and walls were smeared with gunk. Food, cigarette butts and beer bottles littered the floor. The intruders set fire to a bedroom, used the home as a toilet and left other insulting evidence of their raid. Building surveyor Caley, , was heartbroken... and furious. Police had no valid forensic evidence because Katie used to live with Caley and Rodericks knew his victim too – explaining their DNA at the scene. But Caley was suspicious after they gave flimsy and conflicting reasons for not being at the fundraiser. She quizzed neighbours and uncovered a paper trail that finally led to all three being convicted. Last night mum-of-two Caley said: “I built the case against them myself and I was determined they wouldn’t win. Now they know, when they targeted me, they were messing with the wrong woman!” Caley had spent months organising the fundraising event at Capel Manor College in Enfield, North London. She explained: “It was an amazing event to raise money for Tom’s college where he had learned gardening. “We had a funfair, pony rides, a barbecue, performances and even a Bob Marley tribute act. The sun was shining and the crowds were loving it. But at pm I got a text from my neighbour, saying my window blinds were fully down.  “I asked him to look through my window. He said the TV was missing and my house had been ransacked. I felt sick. “I had to carry on the rest of the day knowing my house was wrecked.” When Caley got home to Charlwood Village, Surrey, she was horried. She was mystied too... then realised Katie and Rodericks, , had failed to turn up at the fundraiser. “Something told me it was Katie,” said Caley. “We’d been pals for  years and once shared the house, but our friendship had fallen apart when David came on the scene. He was jealous of our relationship and Katie eventually moved out.” Katie texted Caley saying she missed the memorial event because she was in hospital. But brother Christopher, , had said Katie had gone to Yorkshire. The raiders’ story had unravelled at the first hurdle – and Caley was on to them. Without revealing her suspicions, Caley quizzed neighbours and learned the trio had been at her house that day. One local called police after spotting them arguing outside. Forensics were called in and the three were arrested. “I thought bingo, I’ve got them,” said Caley. “I was gutted a friend could have done such a horrible thing but at least I would get justice.” But police dropped the case after Katie claimed to have a key to the property – explaining the DNA find. Caley went on: “I was livid. I was not about to take this lying down. I hadn’t let on to Katie I knew she had been arrested and she was texting me as normal. “It was a really dficult time. I wonderedthe  years we shared as friends had ever meant anything to her.” But things were to get worse. Weeks later Rodericks filed a civil claim against Caley for money he said she owed him.  Caley said: “I was furious. David had given Katie and I a loan as a rent deposit for the house but I paid it back. I knew he was behind my house being ransacked so I was determined not to pay a penny.” As part of Rodericks’ claim, he supplied credit card statements which were sent on to Caley. She spent hours going through them and realised many household items she and Katie had bought were paid for on Rodericks’ credit card. Caley revealed: “I started to notice discrepancies. Katie and I had bought the TV which she said cost £,, but on the statements it was clearly £,. “I delved deeper and deeper and was shocked. There were so many items she said we’d gone halves on that were cheaper than she claimed. “That’s the catalyst moment when I snapped. I was not having this – no way!” Caley, now of Enfield, filed a counterclaim alleging Katie and Rodericks had conned her out of £,. She won a civil court case and the pair were to told to repay £, between them. Caley continued: “It was great and something to celebrate but they had still got away with wrecking my home.”  After sending police a bundle of evidence – backed up by witnesses who had seen the trio that day – the case was reopened. Caley said: “Every time I found new evidence or someone who could strengthen the criminal case I’d call the police. They must have been fed up of me but I was determined to get justice. Police tracked their phone movements to the area of my house that day. “If I hadn’t kept pushing I don’t think that would have happened.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown exercise time should used","story":"NewsLockdown exercise time should be used to clean up litter, says animal loverRSPCA worker Julie Lyons has been ­spending an hour a day picking litter to save small mammals in the Staffordshire villages of Forsbrook and Dilhorne during coronavirus lockdownShareCommentsByKaren Rockett:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror am celebrity-news video chris-packham--ways-nature-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news lockdown-exercise-time-should-used-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

From -year-old Capt Tom Moore who walked  s of his garden to raise more than £million for the NHS, to the doctors and nurses fighting to save lives, superhuman efforts are being made every day. And while most of us couldn’t contemplate running a marathon or climbing Mount Everest, an inspirational band of Brits have managed these astonishing feats many times over, raising millions for good causes and smashing world records in the process. Their achievements are even more remarkable because they are battling their own obstacles, overcoming the limitations of their bodies and fighting off dark demons to reach for the stars. Today we celebrate the extraordinary efforts of these inspiring Brits and share their stories of amazing endeavours against all odds. aposI did this for my mum and Climbers Against Cancerapos Towering ft above Orkney, the Old Man of Hoy is a ­formidable challenge for even the most able of climbers. The needle-thin rock stack – one of the highest in Britain – is exposed to the elements and surrounded by the crashing waves of the Atlantic Ocean. But for eight-year-old Edward Mills, summoning up the courage to scale this natural wonder was nothing compared to the fight his mum Bekki was waging against breast cancer. The Gloucestershire schoolboy had been a keen climber since the age of two and came up with the idea for the charity challenge on a family holiday to Orkney. And in June , as his proud mum watched from a ferry, he made his incredible ascent, flanked by two coaches. It took Edward four-and-a-half hours to reach the top and become the youngest person to complete the climb. At the summit, he hid a small box with a metal card tucked inside that read: “I did this for my mum and Climbers Against Cancer.” Edward’s record-breaking climb raised £, for charity but most importantly, he made his terminally ill mum incredibly proud in her final days. Bekki passed away three months after Edward’s triumph, aged . Dad Nathan says: “It meant the world to her. “She was going to miss out on everything  in his le – his ­girlfriends, university, his first job – so this was ­something incredible she could be part of and witness.” Two weeks after Bekki died, Edward and big brother George, , also tragically lost their grandad.  Edward went on to win a Pride of Britain award after coming out on top in the Child of Courage category.While collecting his Good Morning Britain-backed award in , the ­youngster complained to then Prime Minister Theresa May about the standard of the loo at No.He told her: “I have a complaint. It’s so posh here I thought your toilet would be made of gold. But it isn’t.” Mrs May, suppressing a smile, replied: “I am sorry about that, Edward. I shall have a word with the Chancellor.” Marathon marvel can walk only using arms As she crossed the finishing line of the London Marathon, Claire Lomas was in last place. But her herculean -day effort to make it to the end made her the true winner of the race. The former top-level event rider was left paralysed from the chest down in a horse riding accident in May .  Doctors told her she would never walk again. But eight weeks later, determined not to take her fate lying down, Claire discharged herself and began rehab. She had to relearn everything, from making a cup of tea to getting dressed. And her courage reaped its rewards. She met husband Dan a year later, had daughter Maisie, and took up new sports such as skiing and handcycling – grateful to still have use of her arms. In April  she put on a pioneering ReWalk “bionic suit” to tackle the . mile marathon at no more than two miles a day. A year later came a -mile handcycle ride around Britain, then she did the Great North Run  in five days – pregnant with second daughter, Chloe. And the following year she finished the ten-mile Great South Run in  hours, her first non-stop endurance event. Claire, who is  next week, has so far raised more than £, for the Nicholls Spinal Injury Foundation. She says of the suit: “It doesn’t walk for me, I have to use the parts that aren’t paralysed to make it walk. It’s not just physical, it’s the concentration with every step.” Yet the Leicestershire mum insists: “It sounds strange, but the best days of my le came after the accident. So many amazing things have happened since that I never dwell on the negatives.” Gold medal and world record after rocks falls    A thirst for adventure was always in Karen Darke’s DNA – and a le-changing injury was not going to stop her. A keen fell runner, mountain biker and competitive rock climber from a young age, she scaled the Matterhorn using just a postcard to guide her. But in , aged , she fell  feet on to rocks while climbing a sea clf – breaking her skull, arms, neck and back. Yorkshire-born Karen woke from a coma to be told she had lost the use of her legs. She says: “I initially thought, ‘I’d rather be dead’. But I soon learned that with friends, creativity and perseverance, most things are possible.” When she left hospital after six months, the first thing she bought was a racechair. Geologist Karen, , became a top-level athlete, and was World Paratriathlon Champion in  and . She won silver at the  Paralympics for handcycling, and followed it up with a gold in Rio – despite being hit by a car during her training. She has handcycled ,km over the Himalayas, sitskied across Greenland and scaled Yosemite’s El Capitan, a four-day climb of , pull-ups. She also holds the women’s handcycle speed record at .mph – and still seeks out adventure. Karen says of her achievements: “Ability is a state of mind, not of body.” Ordeal fit for heroes  After the horrors of war, few challenges remain to truly test you. But Ibi Ali and Luke Wigman, both injured on the front line, found one – the World Marathon Challenge, tackling seven marathons in seven days on seven continents, in conditions from -C ice to C heat. Army captain Ibi won the Military Cross for bravery after continuing to lead his men despite losing part of his right arm and seven pints of blood in Iraq in , when a daisy-chain of linked bombs exploded. RAF paratrooper Luke suffered horric injuries to his left leg from an IED in Afghanistan in . They met at the Invictus Games, and their multi-marathon mission in January  raised £million for a state-of-the-art rehab centre near Loughborough for wounded troops. Luke averaged :: for each marathon, finishing third overall. Ibi, averaging ::, became the first amputee to complete the event. He said: “If we can help just one person through rehab, we’re happy.” Iaposll never give up dream as dancer    Never was a name more appropriate than Pollyanna Hope. After losing her right leg below the knee aged two, Pollyanna refused to let her dreams be dashed. Determined to be a ballerina, she fashioned a pointe shoe for her prosthetic leg from a plastic cup, letting her dance on tiptoe like every other dancer. Mum Sarah says: “She decided, despite what anyone said, she could do it.” Pollyanna, her mum and grandmother Elizabeth were hit by a bus at a bus stop in .

Prince Philip has previous chosen to say such choice ditties as “You managed not to get eaten then ” in conversation with a British trekker in Papua New Guinea in  and, famously, “If you stay here much longer, you’ll get slitty eyes, which he said to a British student in China in . Charles, meanwhile, was more coy when he let slip a famously rude comment - but perhaps did not expect to be caught out by the latest in sound recording tech. It was back in , at a photo session in Klosters ski resort in the Swiss Alps, when the Prince of Wales was asked about his upcoming wedding to Camilla. The eager reporter was one Nicholas Witchell, a seasoned operator who since  had been the BBCaposs royal correspondent. In , Witchell had been the first reporter to announce the death of Princess Diana, Charlesapos first we.And in  his obituary of Princess Margaret - the Queenaposs sister - caused some offence at the Palace for references to her lovers and copious consumption of whisky.For whatever reason, on that cold day in the Swiss Alps, Charles, surrounded as he and his two sons William and Harry were by TV cameras, microphones and journalists, let slip his true feelings about the BBC man. Witchell had asked how Charles was feeling about his upcoming nuptials - William having just answered a similar question. Somewhat cheekily, the Prince of Wales replies: Iaposm very glad you heard of it anyway, before his face contorts into an awkward, somewhat exasperated grin. But then, through gritted teeth, Charles mutters under his breath: Bloody people. I canapost bear that man. Heaposs so awful. He really is.  Whether or not he expected his comment to be picked up is open to debate, but thereaposs no doubting he could see the dozens of microphones honed on his every word. William, to his credit, remains composed despite his dadaposs muttered utterances and continues with a light-hearted response. As long as I donapost lose the rings. I have one responsibility and Iaposm bound to do something wrong, he jokes. William was to be a witness at the wedding the following week.The clip recently resurfaced on Channel aposs The Royals on Holiday programme.Ten years on from that day, Witchell and the Prince had an uncomfortable reunion.  The royal correspondent came face-to-face with the Prince of Wales at an environmental fundraiser in Washington DC in March . It was believed to be the first time the two had met since the heir to the throne was caught muttering his cutting aside. But the Prince seemed unrepentant when confronted by the reporter outside the event. He gave a curt reply when Witchell asked why he still cared so much about environmental issues.  Well, Iaposll turn it round the other way, responded Charles. I think youaposd be more surprisedI didnapost care about these things. But I think particularly in terms of what Iaposve been talking about now, thereaposs an awful lot to worry about. The Prince then quickly got into his car. Speaking in  about the incident, Witchell said: There has never been an apology, and why should there be  He was probably quite right. You know, awful man. You could take the view it was the best thing that happened to me, because it showed that it is our job as BBC journalists to report fairly and accurately, but not to seek approval. Weaposre not there to be liked.  Reports suggested that, back in , Charles had perhaps hoped the cameras would leave him and his sons alone for their weekaposs holiday while preparations for his wedding continued back home. Along with the comment about Witchell, Charles was also caught muttering, I hate doing this, and, Bloody people, as he smiled wryly. That day was also famous for an endearing interaction between Charles and his then-youthful sons. As the reporters bustled in their media huddle, Charles asked William and Harry: Do I put my arms around you   William replied: No, donapost, but you can take the horrible glasses away. Charles said: Do not be rude about my glasses, I couldnapost bear ityou were. A cheeky photographer then tells the Royal trio to look like you know each other, causing the princes to lean into their dad who puts his arms around his sons. Charles then said to his sons: What do we do   And William replied: Keep smiling, keep smiling. As the clip began circulating the globe - far more of a scoop than anything the hopeful hacks could have dreamed of bagging that day in the Alps - the Palace was quick to offer explanations to mitigate the impact. Pictures of Prince William sitting next to his then girlfriend and fellow St Andrews student Kate Middleton on a restaurant terrace the previous day had appeared in the press, and aides suggested the Prince was narked by this.

For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here Congratulations to Tom, I think what heaposs done is utterly amazing, the duke said.

Itaposs not just what heaposs done, itaposs the reaction that people have had as well, I think is again just wonderfully British, he continued. Iaposm just so incredibly proud to see what these iniduals up and down the country and across the world are doing on a day-to-day basis. Itaposs also proving that I think things are better than weaposre led to believe through certain corners of the media. It can be very worrying when youaposre sitting there and the only information you are getting is from certain news channels, but thenyou are out and about or you are on the right s, you can really sense this human spirit coming to the forefront.The duke, who now lives in Los Angeles after he and we Meghan Markle officially gave up their royal duties last month, also thanked NHS workers and volunteers who have been working tirelessly to treat Covid- patients.I want to say a huge thank you, as we all do, to all of the NHS workers and everybody thataposs volunteering, he added. Because up and down the UK, whether itaposs from Dorset up to Staffordshire, there are literally hundreds of thousands of people volunteering. Harry added that he hopes Brits will continue volunteering once the crisis ends. It just makes me incredibly proud to see the Brits stepping up like this, but I really, really hope that this keeps going after coronavirus and after this whole pandemic has come to a close. Itaposs about selflessness rather than selfishness and I think in todayaposs culture, in todayaposs world, we need more role models that are willing to put others ahead of themselves. Reflecting on his time in the army, he said: I think again about being part of a unit, being part of a team, certainly for me wearing a unorm that was the same as everybody . It kind of makes you feel totally equal but at the same time makes you want to do everything you can for the person on your left and the person on your right.

It comes just a day after police chiefs issued new guidance on what counts as a “reasonable excuse” for the public to leave their homes. And while they permitted the purchase of essential tools and supplies to say, repair a fence damaged by bad weather, they said it was not reasonable to pop out for DIY supplies so you can do up your kitchen, for example. But that seemed to go over the heads of some, who were spotted today at The Range in Plymouth with ious items that are likely to fall into the non-essential category. Two shoppers were seen exiting the story with large grow bags and some other planting materials, although one of them was wearing a mask and gloves. Another couple was seen with a wheelie basket filled with potted plants. Bizarrely, one man had even been into the shop to purchase a drone, while another woman had a trolley piled high with soft furnishings. It comes after more than , fines were handed out to people considered to be flouting the rules in England between March  ad April .  During the lockdown – which has now been extended to May  - Brits have been asked to go out just once per day to exercise or buy essential goods. Now police have said needing to cool off from an argument, buying alcohol, taking your pet to the vet or having a rest while out for a walk all count as reasons to be outside the home. The list was issued by the National Police Chiefaposs Council and College of Policingand also says buying food to last several days, including luxury items and alcohol, is also a valid excuse."},{"url":null,"title":"two minutes meghan markles royal","story":"NewsTwo minutes of Meghan Markles royal le that were turning point ahead of quitMeghan Markle and Prince Harry announced they were quitting the royal family in January, but they said they spent months considering their le-changing decision before thatShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video meghan-harry-dance-kick-south-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news two-minutes-meghan-markles-royal-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

After just two years she decided to turn her back on the spotlight and along with husband Prince Harry stepped back from her duties. Many experts have tried to pinpoint the moment the couple decided enough was enough, but one believes there was one engagement in particular that was a real turning point. Christine Ross, the editor of the Meghanaposs Mirror blog, thinks we saw a new side of the royal couple on the first day of their South Africa tour. Shortly before they left a township in Cape Town, the couple were stopped by a group of performers and started dancing with them, and the casual, fun moment became a tour highlight. Speaking on the Mirroraposs royal podcast Pod Save the Queen, she said: She was dancing with the children and it was such a stark contrast to some of the events we had seen before her pregnancy. Sheaposs in this very affordable dress, sheaposs in affordable wedges, her hair is in a ponytail, sheaposs dancing with children. We didnapost know then what we know now but I think that moment and that look was a turning point in their roles, in that they werenapost going to be these high glamour royals any more. They wanted to be more down to earth, with the people, dancing with the children, getting out with the crowds.  Meghan wore a stunning black and white wrap dress by Mayamiko for a visit to a organisation that promotes female empowerment in Cape Town. The £ patterned dress was from Mayamiko, a sustainable Malawi brand. Christine said: I love that wrap dress because itaposs not a royal colour. Meghan does wear bright colours but her signature style and her personal style is more monotonatic - its black, itaposs white, itaposs grey, itaposs deep navy.  This was still her signature colour pallet - she looked so incredibly beautul, she was still showing a very normal post-postum body which so many women around the world appreciated and that outfit to me, especially as it marked the beginning of the tour, was a turning point with her relationship with her role as a duchess. Meghan and Harry shocked fans around the world when they announced their decision to step down in January.

Hospital admissions are beginning to plateau. There are hopes of a vaccine as early as September. Our unity of purpose in defeating this invader remains undimmed – from the collective Thursday turnout to applaud heroic key workers to inidual acts of kindness in delivering supplies to the vulnerable. And Captain Tom Moore’s herculean effort to raise more than £million for the NHS is breathtaking. We all salute you, sir. It is too early to say whether we are witnessing the beginning of the end of this war. But at least we are at the end of the beginning. We are winning the Battle of Britain but there is still a way to go before D-Day. On the NHS frontline and in care homes where the struggle is at its most ferocious, the picture is not so rosy. Personal protection for doctors, nurses and care workers was in short supply when this crisis began and supplies are getting shorter. A nurse tells us she must break safety rules by reusing syringes because they are running out. There is not enough testing to protect them and those they look after. And Health Secretary Matt Hancock’s target of , tests a day seems more dream than imminent scenario. First Secretary Dominic Raab outlines ­conditions to be met before lockdown can be lted. But in terms too vague to be meaningful. The British people are grown-ups. They can be trusted with the truth. And he should tell it like it is, eventhat truth is further restrictions. We are told at each No press conference that the Government will follow the scientic advice. But that too is sometimes contradictory. There was the dangerous fallacy of creating herd immunity until it dawned how many lives that would cost. We were told that face masks were useless and then that they might yet prove useful. We were told to use paracetamol and not ibuprofenwe succumbed to the disease, and then that ibuprofen might be all right after all.  Which shows that while scientists may know more, they do not always know best. They can flounder in the dark just like the politicians. We do not blame them for that. This is a new virus yet to be understood which acts with unpredictable consequences. Fighting it means making much of it up as we go along.

We believe that the association of a sudden and complete olfactoryloss, without nasal obstruction in a patient with other symptoms, such as cough or fever, should alert the clinician to suspect SARS-CoV- infection.

Brittany Jencik, of Penfield, New York says she was asymptomatic and only realised she had caught the deadly bug when her children began falling ill. The US mum of eighteen kids, some of whom are adopted, said she only began feeling really unwell later into the illness.When the virus finally hit her - it hit hard, she told local ABC news affiliate WHAM.Seventeen of her children live with her at home. Ms Jencik said unknowingly contracted the virus around five weeks ago without realising it at first. It was like a freight train, she said. It was terrying. I was a little ahead of them in the timing of it all. I was as afraid of my le as I had ever been, and not much scares me.” She said her family has been self-isolating for the past month and called in a friend for help to professionally clean her home, worrying the virus could linger on surfaces. The cleaner went in wearing hazmat and gasmasks to clean the home for two hours while the family waited outdoors. Research has been unclear in the early stages on whether the virus can strike the same victim twice.There is some hope people become immune after contracting Covid-, but scientists are still working to understand the novel coronavirus.Ms Jencik said having the home cleaned was a no-brainer.  She said: “I needed to know from my mama heart that I was protecting the people I love to the best extent I possibly could. The US has become the world epicentre of the deadly pandemic. New York state, where the Jencik family lives, has led the states in coronavirus infections. The United States has by far the worldaposs largest number of cases with more than , and some , deaths.

The outgoing royals sported colour-coordinated blue bandannas over their faces to protect against coronavirus as they walked two dogs in the city they now call home. The couple had settled in Canada in a £million Vancouver Island bolthole after their split from the royal family. But they relocated to Calornia as the coronavirus outbreak began to spread around the world to Meghanaposs hometown, nearer her mother Doria Ragland. Meghan can be seen carrying a bottle of hand sanitiser as she and Harry walked with beagle, Guy, and black labrador, Oz, and took a hike up a steep, tree-line path.  Both wore face coverings in line with new Calornian regulations as the US battles the pandemic during the outing on Thursday. At one point the beagle appeared to become so overwhelmed in the sunshine cityaposs heat, Meghan had to pick up the pup and carry it. The couple left Archie at home as they took an outing at a hilly local path. Harry, , sported a baseball cap, sunglasses, a t-shirt and Meghan, , was dressed casually in a tee, white trousers and trainers, carrying her iPhone with a gold case and also wearing shades and a cap.They both used blue bandannas to comply with new Calornia regulations on face coverings to combat the spread of coronavirus. A source told The Sun : “Harry and Meghan seemed in very good spirits and the dogs were clearly over the moon to be out and about. “They were hiking for over an hour and when they got back to the car the dogs looked exhausted.  “Meghan even had to carry the beagle back because he was so worn out from the heat. There was one security guard with them during the hike. The pair packed their dogs into the boot of a silver Kia car before heading home. The coupleaposs outing came just hours after Meghan and Harry delivered free meals in West Hollywood for charity Project Angel Food.

The NHS is instructing people not to leave their homethey experience symptoms of Covid-, and highlights a high temperature and a new, continuous cough as the two main warning signs.Rather than visiting a GP, pharmacy or hospital for advice, itaposs urging people who require non-emergency help to use the online  coronavirus service for support. An expert has now told Health that having persistently bloodshot eyes could be a warning sign that someone has been infected.Bloodshot eyes could indicate conjunctivitis, which is caused by an infection or allergies.More research is needed to establish a link between coronavirus and conjunctivitis, a condition which can be caused by a number of factors, but one doctor has said the virus can affect the conjunctiva in the eyes.Conjunctivitis, also known as red or pink eye, usually affects both eyes and causes them to be bloodshot, burn or feel gritty, produce pus that sticks to lashes, itch and water. Dr Vicente Diaz, a Yale Medicine ophthalmologist, told Health: Many viral illnesses can affect the eye, typically causing a follicular type of conjunctivitis. We are learning that COVID- can affect the conjunctiva in a low percentage of people. The theory was backed up by a number of other studies citied by Health. The American Academy of Ophthalmology said that conjunctivitis aposmay be an uncommon but still present symptom of Covid-apos, and that it is import to remember that it can also be caused by allergies, which is aposmuch more likely to be the causeapos in the current season.

From being on the Titanic and trying to stop it sinking, to going for a walk with TV star Lorraine Kelly and her dog - our imaginations are running even more wild than usual as we catch  winks.Experts say itaposs because we are sleeping deeper and for longer, while some of us are suffering from anxiety about the unprecedented situation we find ourselves in. The Google search term “why am i having weird dreams lately” has quadrupled in the past week in the United States alone.People have also been sharing their #pandemicdreams on Twitter after being left either deeply distressed or just really baffled.In my dream, I called an Uber, but a hearse showed up instead. Not liking these #pandemicdreams, posted one Twitter user. A second added: I dreamed I was on the sinking Titanic and I was in charge of figuring out how to fill the leboats to capacity but maintain social distancing in the leboats, and everyone cared more about N masks than lejackets. While a third wrote: I was arguing with a guy in Tesco as he was standing in my spot at the till then I went for a walk with Lorraine Kelly and her dog Angus! Another mused: I dreamt Boris Johnson was feeding me ice cream off a spoon.  Some are finding that they are getting more rest than normal in lockdown, however around a third are reporting losing sleep and suffering restless nights. A study in France found that the coronavirus pandemic has caused a  per cent increase in dreams, with people reporting  per cent more negative ones than usual.Another study in Italy - one of the worst affected countries by Covid- - found that many were experiencing nightmares and parasomnias in line with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Sleep medicine expert Dr Meir Kryger said: This [pandemic] is something that theyaposve never experienced before.  And itaposs possible that their brains are trying to find a time when things werenapost like that.Itaposs like when sometimes people are trying to fall asleep and they canapost turn their minds off. They will try to think about a time when things were better. A dedicated Twitter account – @IDreamofCovid – has even been set up to collate peopleaposs dreams, as well as a Reddit thread. In the UK, sleep expert Professor Russell Foster said the majority of Brits are experiencing a spike in vivid dreams. Professor Foster, who is a director of the Sleep and Circadian Neuroscience Institute at Oxford, told the Sunday Times: Many of us now seem to be populating our dreams with images from the current crisis. Because we are sleeping longer and more deeply, we are having more vivid dreams and remembering them better. And Patrick McNamara, an expert in dreams, told National Geographic: “We normally use REM sleep and dreams to handle intense emotions, particularly negative emotions.Obviously, this pandemic is producing a lot of stress and anxiety.” So what do our most common dream means  A new study from online bed specialists, Bed SOS, which spoke to , people has revealed their top  most common dreams.It showed what percentage of the , had dreamt about:Having sexFallingBeing chasedTeeth falling out or crumblingBeing at workBeing lateFlyingMeeting a celebrityBeing cheated onDemons or monsters - nightmares  in  men also said they have dreamed about being pregnant. Dr Keith Hearne, a British psychologist who conducted the world’s first sleep-lab research into lucid dreams, said: “Dreams, especially those that wake you suddenly, are probably best understood - not literally - but as symbolic messages, and verbal puns, from your wise unconscious. The emotion left on waking is probably the best indicator of whether the dream portrayed something good or bad.” He also explained the deeper meanings behind common dreams... Dreams about sex It is not unusual for human beings to be attracted to each other. In the generally friendly long-term situation of a work-place, little fantasies and flirtations often occur. Freud would have said that a part of our personality which seeks basic gratication, would be responsible. In dreams it is safe to happen and can remain unspoken. Dreams about falling This can cover several dferent scenarios, and often seems to come up as a linguistic pun. The word ‘fall’ is used in several contexts in everyday le. It may appear either as a wish , or refer to a negative event . Recall what was happening in the dream, and the characters present, to uncover the probable topic. Dreams about teeth falling out or crumbling Apart from direct warnings from the unconscious of poor dental care, this dream may be interpreted as a warning that time is passing, and important things need to be done in le, or that you are embarrassed over something insensitive you’ve said to someone . Dreams about being at work Most reported dreams are about ordinary daily situations, so in the two hours or so of dreaming each night it is not surprising to find yourself at work – especiallyyou actually enjoy your job – or carry work-stress home. Dreams about being late This is a common term in waking le for missing an opportunity. In dreams it can be visually and dramatically displayed. Perhaps your unconscious is chiding you for your laziness. Dreams about flyingThis is a well-known metaphor for doing well in le and progressing with ease. Such a positive theme can ‘make your day’ and be encouraging for even more success.Dream about being cheated on by your partner Sometimes such a dream is indicating to the dreamer that cheating is indeed happening. The subconscious is sensitive to subtle clues that go unnoticed consciously, and the dream is just about the only channel of the communication to consciousness. But equally, a person who is lacking in trust may project that issue into their relationship. If the dream occurs in each relationship, the cause is more likely to be the latter.  Dream about demons or monstersThese are feared by most people, but in fact they present a wonderful portal for experiencing ‘lucid’ dreams. Nightmares usually have the same sequence of events. At some point in the dream, the thought occurs ‘Oh, here’s the nightmare’ - which unfortunately has the effect of releasing the full nightmare. You can however convert it into a lucid dream, using the main ‘law’ of all dreaming - that what you think, you will then dream. The technique is to change the mind set from ‘Oh, no! - here’s the nightmare’ to ‘Great, wonderful, here’s the nightmare. That means I’m dreaming, and I can control my dreams.

Lionel Vytialingam was buying food when he heard car horns and saw a small terried dog weaving in and out of traffic in Ipoh, Malaysia. He jumped in his car and followed the abandoned dog until he was able to get close enough to approach the animal. Lionel saw the dog had a soggy note attached to its collar with a rubber band, but didnapost try to retrieve it until he had gained its trust. After about  minutes, the dog plucked up the courage to approach him and Lionel carefully removed the note, while holding on to her apossticky knots of furapos, hoping it contained the owneraposs contact details or an address. Instead, he found a heartbreaking message which read: Woof! Hi! My name is Siggy and Iaposm the most loving and attentive doggy youaposll ever see. My master is very sorry he had to leave me here with you, but he just canapost look after me anymore. I am very sorry about that as Iaposm sure he is too. Please take me into your home.

The note left Lionel in tears and he decided to take the poor pup home, where he fed and bathed her, dried her off and let her sleep in a cosy bed he created under the safety of his sofa. His previously adopted dog Sammo didnapost get along with Siggy, so Lionelaposs brother is taking care of him while Lionel and Siggy stay in temporary accomodation. Lionel said: She had formed the most intense, most pleading eye contact with me from under her matted fringe. I unhooked the note, opened it up and read it right there crouched by the roadside.

It was then that we decided to put our foot on the ball and pause.#We conveyed that decision to the centre and ceased taking calls on the subject.  We needed time to develop a clearer DFC view on the situation.#Whilst it is not our responsibility to take the lead on solutions for the league , it is our duty to attempt to ensure that the future of Scottish Football remains promising for all the clubs.#To that end, we have we have worked tirelessly to achieve solutions to help those who were being disadvantaged and sought ways to help them.#We have discussed options with a iety of member clubs to show solidarity to the clubs most negatively impacted by the SPFL proposal.  Relegated clubs must have financial assistance to help soften the landing so they can begin the next season on more equitable footing.#Through our discussions it appears that there is an appetite to provide ious forms of support from other member clubsthese clubs are in fact relegated.  Further details of these acts of kindness and solidarity will be worked out amongst the member clubs.#Also, we are sorry to disappoint all of the conspiracy theorists by saying that we were never exposed to any ‘deals’ from either of the Glasgow giants.  They both acted, as we would expect, with complete professionalism.#Additionally and most importantly for Dundee FC, we spoke to other member clubs regarding their appetite for reconstruction, as the SPFL’s briefing notes does not give us much of a chance and this is the only aspect of any proposal that helps Dundee FC in any way.#There are several things that have to be in place in order to deliver a proper opportunity of achieving a better foundation for Scottish Football’s future.  First, a working group should be assembled and must have members from the highest levels of Scottish Football with long-term interest in the future success of the game.#We need to agree a set of goals that will be the basis of reconstruction which takes into account current and future wants and needs of media member clubs’ financial benefits and sporting integrity as a basis.#It is our belief that after speaking to numerous clubs that the appetite for reconstruction is there and the intention is to set up an immediate and focused working group to take on this task.  The centre will have to accept and support the will of the members.#We do believe the centre has made mistakes in this process, namely not taking into consideration any financial fallout to their member clubs and publishing of the incomplete ballot results, which has put Dundee FC in a position to receive criticism and undue torment.#If what we achieved in our pause was presented by the SPFL in the first instance we would have voted in favour of the proposal.#We would like to thank the fans for their patience, and most of the member clubs for their cooperation and support during this time.  Make no mistake, we continue to have a daunting task ahead of us, but we are encouraged by everyday acts of kindness, resolution, and humanity that we are all sharing as we get through this together.  Stay safe and hope we see you soon in a newly revamped league.#lthr  gtltstronggt🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

This was a highly unusual end to the season, to say the least, and not the one any of us would have preferred, but all three deserve enormous credit for their performances over the course of the season.“With the turmoil and uncertainty caused by the Covid- outbreak, there was always going to be a highly-charged and passionate debate about how we secure the future of Scottish football.“It is no exaggeration to say that this was an existential matter for Scottish clubs, with many of them telling us they were at real risk of going under unless the situation was resolved very quickly, so I’m pleased that the game has moved decisively.“Whilst more than % of clubs agreed with the directors’ written resolution, it’s clear that others were strongly opposed.“There has been talk of voiding the season, making emergency loans and so on, but what has been agreed today is not just the best way forward, it was the only realistic way forward and I now call on all  clubs to move forward in a constructive and positive way.”SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster also had his say on tonight’s development.He said: “Prior to this positive result, we were unable to make the vital end-of-season payments, which will provide a leline to so many clubs in the lower isions. From our detailed discussions with clubs, many were facing an enormous cash-flow crisis. We have moved as quickly as possible to try to resolve this unprecedented situation.“We’ve achieved the % agreement threshold in the Ladbrokes Premiership, Championship and Leagues  and  and will now be working as quickly as we can to get the end-of-season payments to members in the three lower isions by the end of this week.”🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to get out for their paper, we are pledging to help readers by providing a FREE digital edition of the Eveningfor three months.

dundee fans want answers from john nelms over vote u turn","story":"Dundee chief John Nelms told fans a ‘yes’ vote was the best possible deal for the club after supporters questioned his U-turn in the SPFL voting saga.Managing director Nelms responded to an email from the Dundee Supporters Association, which comprises  clubs and over , members, after they demanded answers over the Dens Park side’s stance on the controversial SPFL proposal that handed titles to rivals Dundee United, Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers.The Dark Blues have been at the centre of the storm that engulfed Scottish football since last Friday’s requested deadline where their ‘no’ vote failed to arrive with the SPFL and subsequently saw the club holding the decisive call for five days.The club issued a statement at lunchtime yesterday outlining their side in the furore but fell short of declaring their intention to later change to a ‘yes’ vote which sparked outcry from a number of Dark Blues fans when it emerged.The vote saw the SPFL resolution passed but also brought forward league reconstruction talks with Hearts chair Ann Budge joined by Hamilton counterpart Les Gray leading the working group – a stipulation Nelms had made clear would be in exchange for a ‘yes’ to minimise the financial harm dished out to some clubs by the original deal and get the best deal for the Dee.The reaction has been mixed across the Dundee fan group, some positive, many refraining from casting judgement, but amongst that there has been real anger with some fans left dismayed and some even feeling betrayed by the change of decision from Nelms, prompting the request for answers from the DSA.The concern from many is the move did little for the club’s interests while, at the same time, gted the Championship league title to their fiercest rivals.The email sent by the DSA committee yesterday and seen by the Tele said: “We are sure everyone felt a sense of relief yesterday with the casting of the Dundee FC vote in regards to the SPFL resolution of April  but are disappointed that the club has not yet offered a statement to clary the Dundee FC position or explain the change of mind in the voting process from a ‘No’ to a ‘Yes’.“We would urge you therefore to make one as soon as possible to put an end to the conjecture which still continues.“Supporters of Dundee Football Club have been patient over the last few days while trusting that the club would make the correct decision in not just our interests and but the interests of Scottish football as a whole and would welcome a public statement of clarity.“The statement issued by the club yesterday was thought to be vague in some quarters and we feel did not clary or explain our voting position and so we would like to request that the club do this as soon as is practically possible.”Nelms moved quickly to try to assuage fears from the fans responding in a statement: “By way of further explanation of our statement from April , Dundee FC submitted its vote to the SPFL and issued its statement simultaneously.“There was no changing of our vote at any time that day as has been reported in some channels.“If what we achieved in our pause was presented by the SPFL in the first instance we would have voted in favour of the proposal on  April .“We have achieved the best deal possible out of a situation that was going to be bad for us in any iteration that was being proposed.“Let us be clear, no matter what the proposal looked like, the majority of the clubs in the Premiership and the Championship are proponents of promotion relegation.“Any solution that did not include this would not have enough support to be passed.  Therefore, the SPFL chose to include it to expedite the conclusion, but without considering the ramications to all clubs.“Most importantly for Dundee FC, we spoke to other member clubs regarding their appetite for reconstruction, as the SPFL’s briefing notes did not give us much of a chance.“This is the only aspect of any proposal that helps Dundee FC in any way.“As stated yesterday, reconstruction could help ensure the future of Scottish football as a sustainable and profitable one.“After speaking to numerous clubs we believe that the appetite for reconstruction is there and the intention is to establish an immediate and focused working group to take on this task.“We stated that the SPFL will have to accept and support the will of the members.  As you saw in the SPFL statement last night, they already have started this process.“In conclusion, from a very poor situation we have gotten the best result for Dundee FC and for Scottish football as a whole.“Of  teams,  have voted yes in a democratic ballot and for most, the important thing is the monies can be distributed and they can work on survival plans for their clubs.“It is time now toour focus on staying safe and planning for the future of Dundee FC.”🔵 In these troubled times, when many people are struggling to

funding","story":"The co-leader of Aberdeen City Council has called for local authorities to receive their fair share of funding allocated to aid the fight against coronavirus.The UK Government has so far distributed an additional £ million to Scotland as the country continues to feel the effects of the global outbreak.But councillor Douglas Lumsden warned of the unexpected financial challenges faced by Aberdeen because of the pandemic.He has written to the Scottish Government’s local government minister Kevin Stewart – also the MSP for Aberdeen Central – to ensure councils across the country receive a large enough share to help them continue to battle the outbreak.Mr Lumsden said: “Aberdeen City Council has responded to the coronavirus pandemic extremely well.“However, the council’s finances and projections are going to be lower than was anticipated at the budget in March.“It is therefore imperative that the Scottish Government provides Aberdeen City Council and other councils with a fair share of the £m provided to them by the UK Government.”He added: “As the local government minister I have written to Kevin Stewart MSP as I expect him to be fighting local government’s corner, to ensure that he will do everything in his power to support our public services and back local government, so we can continue to provide vital public services in the future.”Mr Stewart said the money would be used to fund measures brought in to deal with coronavirus.And he insisted ministers would continue to demand more money from Westminster.He said: “The money from the coronavirus emergency response fund – due to Scotland as a consequence of UK Government spending where – has already been allocated to support a range of important measures in the fight against the pandemic, including additional funding for NHS staffing costs and to help charities deal with consequences of Covid-.“While we welcome the help provided to date, we will continue to strongly press the UK Government for urgent additional funding for the health service, local government and care sector to adequately deal with the scale of this crisis.”Meanwhile, Aberdeenshire West MSP Alexander Burnett said the additional cash would help ease the burden on the north-east’s public services.He said: “I am very pleased that on top of paying the bulk of wages for furloughed employees and supporting the self-employed and businesses, this UK money is going towards public services.“The UK Government have been clear that it will do whatever it takes to help all corners of the UK through the pandemic.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/04/2.35523615-1-240x180.jpg

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night! All of us were agreed that never had we experienced anywhere a worse one and we were glad we had been in Loch Aline on Sunday night not in Tobermory as intended as, from what we heard, that night had been similar but twice as bad.It was a wild night lashing with rain and a big swell was rolling in from the north-east causing us to pitch and roll horribly. Everything banged and rattled and the ropes, despite their lashings, slapped on the mast, the chain rugged continuously on the bobstay, and there was one most annoying thump that kept everyone awake .We could not trace its origin until in desperation the Pilot donned oilskins, sou’wester and seaboots, and went on deck and found it was the tiller end bumping on the bulwarks. The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club. In , he flamboyantly arrived in Inverness by helicopter for Inveraray#s Camanachd Final against Kingussie."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 10 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs we have highlighted in the paper over the past few weeks, the response of the public in the coronavirus crisis has been superb.People generally have abided by government advice to stay at home.

There are obviously many reasons why you may be thinking about acquiring a new dog.Our receptionist Lesley Baillie ndash who works in both Dunedin Vets branches in North Berwick and Prestonpans ndash recently had to bid farewell to her elderly dog Millie, her companion and friend for many years.Lesley was devastated but knew she needed a companion to fill the void. She began to consider which breed or type of dog would be best for her.The arrival of a new pet is a very exciting time, but careful consideration should be made regarding the type and breed of dog you choose.Many problems we encounter in the practice are a result of purchasing a pet not suited to lestyle and family environment.There are, however, many benefits of owning a pet. Companionship is the most obvious.Having a pet to talk to and interact with can take away many of the stresses of daily le.Taking a dog for a walk provides exercise and helps in creating a healthy lestyle. Having a pet is known to assist in the recovery from illness. In fact, PATdogs are encouraged in some hospital wards to help patients on the road to recovery.Dogs come in a huge iety of breeds, shapes and sizes, so choosing a dog to fit your lestyle can be extremely dficult. It is best to do lots of research before contemplating buying a dog.Many dogs have natural instincts such as herding and guarding, and these should be considered prior to choosing a dog.Also consider how the pup was raised. Were they house or kennel reared There are seven main classes of dogs, each with their own characteristics:l Toy dogs: as the name suggests, they are small dogs but are generally high maintenance and require a lot of grooming. They are, however, dogs and not toys or accessories. Examples: Bichon Frise and Chihuahua.l Utility breeds: there are a iety of breeds in this class but most tend to be courageous extroverts so need good control. Examples: bulldog and Dalmatian.l Terriers: they hunt by instinct and are brave and tough. They may be generally small but require lots of exercise and play. Examples: Border terrier and Airedale.l Hounds: these hunt and can be quite aloof they are quite independent and often like to be with one owner. Examples: bloodhound and basset hound.l Working dogs: as the name suggests, they have specic jobs. They are intelligent and may be quite large and guard dogs. Examples: St Bernard and Samoyed.l Pastoral dogs: these are bred to work with livestock and are very intelligent. They require mental and physical stimulation and tend to be tough and need a role. Examples: Border collie and Belgian shepherd dog.l Gundogs: they find and retrieve game. They have amenable temperaments and are active and affectionate. Examples: springer spaniel and retriever.We cannot, however, forget the crossbreed dogs, which are by far the most popular dogs around. Their nature will depend on their breeding and obviously they come in a huge range of sizes.Nowadays, there a large number of crossbreeds which are designated lsquodesigner breedsrsquo. Breeders will tell all the advantages of these lsquobreedsrsquo, but be aware not only are there advantages attributed to the parents, genetic traits from both breeds may also be present and in veterinary practice, we do see a disproportionately high number of problems with these dogs.There are many questions you should ask yourself before considering buying a dog.l Are there young children in the family  A utility dog, such as a miniature Schnauzer, or gundog e.g. Labrador may be breeds to consider.l Is everyone in the family out of the house during the day  Are you really able to look after a dog  An independent cat may be the best option.l Do you live in a flat  Consider a toy dog, e.g. Chihuahua.l Are you fit and able to go for long walks  Then the working or pastoral dogs should be considered e.g. Border collie or Doberman.l Do you have any fur allergies  Consider some the soft-coated dogs such as poodles.l Do you have a large garden  The terriers enjoy running around in enclosed spaces, e.g. Border or Patterdale terriers.Lesley considered very carefully what breed she should choose.She knew she wanted a fairly active dog who would enjoy long walks and travelling in her campervan with her.She also knew she did not want an overly large breed. She works part-time so wanted a breed which could be trusted to be left for short periods but was also friendly and enjoyed loving, human contact.After much deliberation, Lesley settled on a Tibetan terrier.These are a medium-sized breed originating in Tibet.Despite the name, they are not terriers but actually working dogs.They are therefore very loyal and affectionate but also energetic and sensitive.Tibetan terriers have a mid- coat which is very soft and hypoallergenic so excellent for anyone with animal hair allergies, but does require a good deal of grooming.After searching far and wide, Lesley found a breeder who had just had a litter of puppies.So, after a few weeks and a long journey, wee Hetty arrived home with Lesley.She really is a cutie and was so well behaved when Lesley brought her to the surgery.She is settling in well at home and hopefully she and Lesley will have many happy years and enjoyable adventures together.The rewards of owning a pet are immense.With careful consideration prior to purchasing a pet, you can have a cherished companion for many years to come.Caring for them can sometimes be a challenge but should give great pleasure to owner and pet alike."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-toast-diamond-wedding-anniversary","story":"The message came as a very pleasant surprise for Lyn and Alan Vaughan, who are living in self-isolation on the townrsquos Williamstone Court.Lyn said that, unknown to her, her daughter Julie had made contact with the relevant officials.ldquoThe letter from Her Majesty was as a huge surprise when it arrived, said a delighted Lyn.It was also thanks to Julie ndash though inadvertently ndash that the couple were able to celebrate with  members of their family and friends at a pre-anniversary dinner in La Potiniere restaurant in Gullane a few days before the coronavirus lockdown was imposed.ldquoJulie was going on be on a ski holiday on the actual date of our anniversary, so we had a family lunch at La Potiniere, said Lyn.ldquoDue to the lockdown we canrsquot see them now, so it was very fortunate that we got together that day.On the evening of their anniversary, they joined the applause for the NHS in their road.Lyn, , and Alan, , were both born and brought up in Birmingham.The couple met at a ballroom dancing class and got married three years later on March , .The couple moved to Scotland in the s when Alan was working as a chartered surveyor on the St James Centre in Edinburgh.They moved to Gullane in  and lived there for  years before moving to North Berwick so they could be closer to the railway station as Alan had become partially sighted.As well as Julie and Andrew, the couple had another son Chris, who sadly died in  from a brain tumour.

As before, the flames fizzed for a moment but it made no dference.Just then a hare ran by and saw what the squirrel was doing.ldquoYou foolish animal, said the hare, ldquoyou canrsquot put the fire out by yourself.The squirrel looked at the hare and nodded.ldquoI know she said, ldquobut the forest is my home so Irsquom doing what I can do.Then she asked the hare, ldquoWill you help me The hare thought for a moment. He didnrsquot live in the forest like the squirrel, but it was important for him as he would use the forest often to eat bark and twigs when there was no grass to eat.ldquoI wouldI could, said the hare, ldquobut the thing is I donrsquot have a bushy tail like you.ldquoHmm thatrsquos true said the squirrel, ldquobut you do have long ears.

The squirrel shook her tail and the hare wiggled his ears.They sprayed the fire with droplets of water, and as before the flames fizzed for a moment, but it made very little dference.Just then a wild cat came by. She saw what the squirrel and hare were doing.ldquoYou foolish animals, said the wild cat, ldquoyou canrsquot put out the fire, just the two of you.The hare looked at the wild cat and nodded.ldquoWe know he said, ldquobut the forest is our home and feeds us, so we are doing what we can do.Then the squirrel looked at the wild cat and asked her, ldquoWill you help us The wild cat looked at the squirrel and the hare, and licked her lips.Normally they would be a good lunch option.

People in England are dying of Covid- at . times the rate of Ireland, which has a comparable number of ICU beds per head of population.Theses and explanations already exist, of course, but are not judged by politicians to be politically expedient or comfortable.

A death begets a byelection. Crises, however grim, can be opportunities.So it was quite a surprise to see the SNP come over all prim and prissy this week about discussing independence in relation to the coronavirus.The prompt was Scottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw joining the dots between the two as he looked ahead to the  Holyrood election.ldquoI think it will look ridiculousthe first debate that the Nationalist movement want to have when we get to the other side of this is lsquoLetrsquos go gung ho for independence next yearrsquo, then more fool themthey do, he told the PA news agency.ldquoI think the public will look at that and say lsquoAre you kidding rsquoHe then twisted the dirk by observing Scotland was being helped through the outbreak by the UKrsquos ldquoeconomic resilience and strength.The SNPrsquos reaction to this was to try to shut down the debate entirely, a sure sign Mr Carlaw had drawn blood.ldquoThe last thing any Scottish politician on any side of the constitutional debate should be doing is trying to use the appalling crisis we all currently face as an argument for or against independence, the party gasped.Obviously, therersquos a calculation to be made about how far to venture into regular politics during the pandemic.The public has lost much of its appetite for the previous argy-bargy.But for the party of independence to echo Theresa May and say now is not the time to argue for its cause at all Well, that was a moment.Becauseever there was a time for the SNP to talk about independence - at least to itself - it is surely right now.Its previous case for leaving the UK, of a healthier economy creating a fairer society, is being dismantled by Covid-. Not speaking up would be a dereliction of the partyrsquos mission.The First Minister, as the tireless face of Scotlandrsquos response to the emergency, is an understandable exception. But for the Yes movementrsquos sake, she cannot be the rule.SNP MP Angus Brendan MacNeil had the right idea. He simply ignored the injunction from party HQ and tweeted that it was good Mr Carlaw brought up independence, as it let the SNP government mention it too and ldquohighlight that dealing with your own problems unfettered... is better.Regardless of whether you agree with his point, it made perfect sense for Mr MacNeil to make it, to keep saying what he believes in, and not cede the floor to his opponents.He could see Mr Carlaw wasnrsquot squeamish about a Unionist argument based on Covid-. That reference to the UKrsquos economic resilience and strength was a straw in the wind.Come the  election, the Tories, Labour and LibDems will be arguing that the Union, far from being an abstract anachronism, proved its worth in this crisis. That when it really mattered, Westminster broke the emergency glass at the Treasury and hosed the country with money. That the insurance policy paid out.: Mark Smith: A message for nationalists: do not make the virus about Scotland versus England ndash it demeans youPeople will of course argue over the many failings, about testing, PPE and the threadbare state of the NHS and the welfare state going into this.But the key message from the Unionist side, like it or loathe it, will be that the four-nations of the UK pulled together and got things done.And while there were regional tweaks, Scotland was a core part and beneficiary of that collective effort. Go ask its Nationalist First Minister.That argument is what the Yes movement, with its garlands of rosy hypotheticals, now has to overcome.It must rethink its own arguments - not its beliefs, but its messages to the unpersuaded - and it needs to get a sht on. Above all, it needs to say how a fledgling state can take off in the worst recession in a century.For what goes into the next white paper on independence now It was supposed to be rooted in Andrew Wilsonrsquos Growth Commission, the SNPrsquos economic blueprint for a new Scotland.Itrsquos not Mr Wilsonrsquos fault he didnrsquot factor in a pandemic. But it has made much of his work redundant.Its research on how small countries can prosper is salvageable. But his calculations for the first decade of independence - based on long-term growth of .%, halving a deficit of %, keeping debt below % of GDP - look like bygones of a dferent era.As the report said, persuading No voters about the economics of independence will need ldquoclear-sighted reality and a rigorous plan.But as wersquove learned, no plan survives contact with coronavirus, and economic plans least of all.That particular pillar of the SNPrsquos case has now crumbled. The longer the crisis goes on, the more pages in the old prospectus will turn blank.The one thing that could yet change the dynamic is Brexit. If the UK government refuses to extend trade talks with the EU in light of coronavirus and brings about a hard lurch to WTO terms in the depths of a recession, it will squander any credit it is accumulating at present, and remind a lot of Scottish voters why they wanted to wave Westminster goodbye.:Scottish independence support maintains lead in latest pollHowever the current refusal to change course probably owes more to the absence of the only Tory who can sell an extension to Leave voters than dogmatism. Only once the Prime Minister s from convalescence can a pragmatic position prevail.Eventhe PM sticks to his original mad timetable, Ms Sturgeon cannot rely on it tipping the case for independence. She needs a new pitch as well.Her announcement yesterday of an economic recovery advisory group acknowledged that. Despite insisting she has no time for party politics right now, she said the new group would plan how to build a ldquofairer, greener and more equal society after Covid-, a clear nod to independence.It will be instructive to see how many politicians she sprinkles among the economists and business leaders to help steer it in that direction.God knows, she needs something to go right for her cause just now.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

That is why I am asking them to stay away and stay at home.\"Access to healthcare is not easy here at the best of times - we simply cannot cope with visitors at this time.\"He added: \"If we are to beat the virus, then we must accept that we are all in this together and that we must all - regardless of who we are - obey the rules.\"I am writing to the Prime Minister to askhe will put pressure on booking to halt future holidays in the Highlands until we are absolutely sure the pandemic is over. I am determined to keep the pressure up on booking and protect my constituents.\":Coronavirus in Scotland: Ian Blackford calls for all Highland accommodation to close in bid to stop spread of COVID-All political parties have expressed concern over people attempting to escape cities and towns to rural and isolated parts of Scotland, in a bid to evade contracting the virus. But the behaviour results in too many people arriving in locations that have less resources to deal with an increase in patients, who need specialist and often intensive care facilities.Scottish communities angrily reacted to the influx in visitors - some resorting to barricading lay-bys and would-be camping areas - warning that their already-under pressure local health services cannot cope with the extra strain.Last month, a military aircraft was needed to transport a critically-ill coronavirus patient from the Shetland Islands to Aberdeen to receive intensive care treatment.This led to the Scottish Government announcing that ferries services were now to only be used for islanders, allowing them to continue essential journeys.Even before the official lockdown was put in place, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told accommodation providers to stop accepting bookings - a message reiterated ahead of what would have been the Easter holidays.A Scottish Government spokesperson, said: ldquoWe need everyone to stay at home to help us save lives and protect our NHS.\"We also need businesses to help us achieve this. Travel companies are expected to act responsibly and not take any holiday bookings. Failure to comply with this puts people at risk.The public has repeatedly been told to stay at home unless shopping for essential food and medicines, work which cannot be completed at home and once a day for a session of outdoors exercise.

No government has given reason to hope that the present lockdown will be eased, for any group, any time soon.We need young people to keep the economy going and I for one would be ready to continue to stay in lockdownI knew that parents could resume a more normal le and little children could access the locked play parks again.Can we not agree that those in good health, those who are tasked to build all our futures be allowed to have their lives less restricted  By all means ask them to be careful, maintain social distancing wherever possible and restrict access to older people.

As an elder in our Welsh chapel he had a certain way with him to comfort people. People, of all religious beliefs round our home area would say \"send for Elwyn\" and he would keep the \"night watch\". Then be at work the next day.When it was his time to die, he was at my home so my late husband, my mother and I were there for the weeks of his last illness. Even when he was dying my mother always shared their bed and he was never alone. The doctor and district-nurse were constant presences. His last day, as I was at work, I was phoned and broke the sound barrier to get home to be with him. I lay on his bed, held his hand and whispered. He always knew that I loved him, as he loved me. My splendid old dad.The last few paragraphs of the article by Professor Andrew Elderreally struck a chord. I can live with myself because I was at my fathers dying and he knew that we all loved him he was not alone. My daughters suicide,  years ago, meant she was totally alone, I could not be with her so the pain and grief are never-ending. Prof Elder is quite right when he says: \"We can find ways to allow families to be together at this time\".

Again. Irsquom lying in bed, have been for half an hour, trying to beat back the fragments of thoughts, the noisy nonsense of insomnia, breathing in and out, my brain churning through indefinable problems which probably donrsquot even really exist, until finally, I admit defeat, walk downstairs, make myself a cup of caffeine-free tea and try to work. My only company is the birdsong ndash and, perhaps, you. Because I know, during this lockdown and pandemic, there are others out there, somewhere in this city, somewhere in the land, somewhere on Twitter. This is lockdown. Days and nights donrsquot work like they used to.They neither work for those of us trapped in our homes in quarantine, nor for those on the frontline. One study found that one-third of healthcare workers suffered insomnia during the Covid- epidemic in China. Those reporting sleeplessness were also more likely to feel depressed, anxious, and have stress-based trauma. I canrsquot help feeling my own sleep struggles are nothing compared with the torment of being unable to drop off while also knowing you have to go, exhausted, into a hospital the next day, to do your work of trying to save lives, perhaps with equipment that is inadequate.But all of us listen to the news. All of us have heard the stories about the extension of lockdown, the impact on the economy, the rising figures in intensive care, the elderly dying in care homes. Almost all of us have lost the routines that kept us rooted. Almost all of us are worrying about something or somebody. We are all in touch with the collective trauma of this pandemic.Sleep expert Dr Donn Posner, speaking at a Hard TH Chan School of Public Health online forum, recently described the current pandemic, with its lockdown conditions, as a ldquoperfect storm of sleep problems. He observed: ldquoThe actions that wersquore taking to protect ourselves can not only precipitate problems with sleep, but lead to chronic problems with sleep.We probably all know the common advice on whatrsquos called better sleep hygiene ndash donrsquot drink caffeine after lunchtime, avoid too much alcohol, do plenty of exercise, turn off your screens in the evening, create a bedtime routine, meditate, aim for around seven hours sleep, avoid daytime napping. Yet that advice doesnrsquot seem quite adequate for these times of fear and social distancing. Our bodies are bound to react to the combination of being cooped up and under the kind of stress that triggers the fight-or-flight response. One clinical psychologist, Lucy Johnstone, interviewed by Wired last week, noted: ldquoI think itrsquos important not to medicalise our responses, whether emotional or physical, and of course these are intertwined. Personally, I would be more concerned about someone who is not feeling alarmed by the threats we are facing.In my view, worse than insomnia is worrying about insomnia. Even sleep experts like Posner advise not trying to force ityou canrsquot sleep. ldquoGood sleepers, he says, ldquoput no effort into sleep whatsoever. Thats why Im up and working. That and the fact that I do think there may be a place for working our fears out during the night.

It has already been wonderful for me. I canrsquot thank them enough for what they do for me, said Mrs Gibbs. ldquoI am no longer able to get out and online shopping is not an option for me as my eyesight is poor.ldquoNothing is too much trouble for them. I phone up with my weekly orders and you feel asyou have a friend at the other end. The service they provide is even more important given the circumstances we now find ourselves in. To know that your shopping will be brought to your door is such a relief.Mrs Gibbs says the volunteers are taking great care when they bring her shopping.She added: ldquoEveryone is taking greater health and safety. The volunteer lets me know when they are on their way. When they arrive I make sure I have enough time to move to another room. I have had a number of challenges in my le and have learned to adapt. I am also content with my own company and can fill my days with interests, but for some people finding themselves in isolation must be very dficult and I feel for them.The Food Train was set up in  and has been making daily le easier for older people, providing vital services to those who are no longer able to manage independently, through age, ill health, frailty or disability. It makes hundreds of grocery deliveries every week, ensuring those most in need have access to fresh groceries. And during this crisis it has been a godsend for many.Emma Black, fundraising and marketing manager at the Food Chain, which has sites across Scotland, said they have had more than  volunteers sign up to help in Glasgow since Covid- outbreak.She said: ldquoWith new customers coming on board we are now reaching nearly  vulnerable older people across Glasgow but these numbers are increasing daily.ldquoDue to the increase in customer numbers we are introducing our brand new : shopping service, whereby we match volunteers up with a vulnerable older person to shop for them specically.As their fundraising activity has gone down and our costs have gone up particularly in staffing, personal protection equipment and fuel, they have set up a Just Giving page https:www.justgiving campaign FoodTrainIan Arthur is one of the newest recruits and volunteered at the beginning of the crisis.ldquoI had been taking shopping to my mother-in-law and leaving it on the doorstep and I thought there must be many more people in Glasgow in this similar situation where they canrsquot get out but might not have the help there, said Mr Arthur.ldquoI searched online for groups online in my area and the Food Train came up.

Although in the initial days before lockdown was enforced, Ms Bechelli had been helping to set up the group she is now relying on.ldquoI had been helping out with social media and a JustGiving page for Kinross Kindness, little did I know at the time I would come to need their help, said Ms Bechelli. ldquoWhen advice changed and lockdown came I was one of the ones being told to isolate for  weeks as I have Crohnrsquos disease.

Writer at Large Neil Mackay reportsITrsquoS just over a year since the Christchurch massacre in New Zealand, when  people were shot dead at a mosque and Islamic centre ndash the killings live-streamed online.What marked the atrocity out as dferent from other white supremacist attacks, was that a manesto believed to have been connected to the gunman spoke of the acts being inspired by \"eco-fascism\". The manesto talks of environmentalism and population growth. It states that: ldquoContinued immigration into Europe is environmental warfare.Christchurch, however, wouldnrsquot be the last time that far-right violence intersected with the environment. Four-and-a-half months after Christchurch, on August , , a gunman shot and killed  people in El Paso, Texas. The killings were the deadliest attack on Americarsquos Latino community in history. A manesto, which police believe is connected to the alleged gunman, said the El Paso killings were inspired by what happened in Christchurch and motivated by ldquothe Hispanic invasion of Texas.The El Paso manesto is called \"An Inconvenient Truth\" ndash mirroring the title of Al Gorersquos  documentary on the threat of climate change. In the manesto, the writer says the people of America are ldquotoo stubborn to change their lestyles ldquoso the next logical step is to decrease the number of people in America using its resources. If we can get rid of enough people, then our way of le can become more sustainable.The writer also talks of oil, agriculture, and recycling the destruction of the environment and the impact of environmental degradation on future generations. ldquoOur lestyle is destroying the environment of our country, the manesto reads. ldquoThe decimation of the environment is creating a massive burden for future generations. Corporations are heading the destruction of our environment by shamelessly over-harvesting resources.One man has pleaded guilty to the Christchurch killings, and one man is awaiting trial for the attack in El Paso.Are these shootings the canary in the coal-mine, however  Are they warning us that the most extreme elements of the far-right are starting to co-opt environmentalism  Once the coronavirus pandemic is over, who knows how politics will realign and ideology sht and change.With climate change denial now recognised widely as an untenable scientic position, some extremists have latched on to environmental concerns, added them to racism and anti-immigration beliefs, and created a curdled form of eco-fascism.Professor Gary LaFree, from the University of Maryland and a former director of the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, has studied the role of environmentalism for a new breed of far-right extremists.ldquoTheyrsquore building an ideology, he says, adding: ldquoYou notice theyrsquore referring to each other hellip which to me makes it scarier. Itrsquos more like a social movement.Academic, activist and author Naomi Kleinrsquos new book, On Fire: TheCase For A Green New Deal, warns of the growth of eco-fascism. Klein has been called ldquothe intellectual godmother of the Green New Deal Movement. The Green New Deal envisages a greening of the economy, and reforms creating a fairer job market.Klein says: ldquoMy fear is that, unless something signicant changes in how our societies rise to the ecological crisis, we are going to see this kind of white power eco-fascism emerge with much greater frequency, as a ferocious rationalisation for refusing to live up to our collective climate responsibilities.At the heart of the problem is this: whattodayrsquos idealistic climate campaigners fail to change things  Whatactivists like Greta Thunberg donrsquot succeed in making governments act for the good of the world  Could environmentalism then be hijacked by the far right As the climate deteriorates, and governments fail to act, the far-right is already starting to seek to exploit public fears and discontent. There has long been academic theorising that in order to fix an almost insurmountable problem like climate change, society might find itself turning to some form of authoritarian \"strongman\" party or government, as liberal democracy may be too weak to take the measures required.Professor Michael E Zimmerman, a philosopher and environmental historian, describes eco-fascism as \"a totalitarian government that requires iniduals to sacrice their interests to the well-being of the lsquolandrsquo .It is easy to see how the far-right could manipulate environmental issues and pit them against immigration. So far, the far-right has been pretty much in the climate denial camp ndash but it looks asthatrsquos starting to change. In France, Marine Le Pen, leader of National Rallyndash until recently the National Front ndash has started to go green. France and Europe, says Le Pen, should be the worldrsquos ldquofirst ecological civilisation.One prominent member of RN, Jordan Bardella, said that ldquoborders are the environmentrsquos greatest ally itrsquos through them that we will save the planet.Le Pen has said the inidual is ldquonot simply a consumer or producer but ldquosomeone rooted, someone who wants to live on their land and pass it on to their children. She says someone ldquowho is rooted in their home is an ecologist and that those who are ldquonomadic hellip donrsquot care about the environment they have no homeland.The French thinker Jean-Yves Camus, who specialises in the extreme right, says environmentalism has ldquobecome part of the RNrsquos political agenda, but itrsquos a specically far-right form of environmentalism ndash very identitarian.Camus believes many far-right voters ldquosee society as like a biological organism that should be kept in its original state. According to this line of thinking, when a foreign body is introduced, it causes disorder ndash hence the anti-immigration stance. Logically, the same goes for nature: we must respect the natural order.The hardline Alternative for Germany Party has also seen an environmental sht. The youth wing of Germanyrsquos anti-immigrant party has been urging its leaders to drop climate denial.Naomi Klein says: ldquoThere is rage out there that is going to go somewhere, and we have demagogues who are expert at directing rage at the most vulnerable among us while protecting the most powerful and most culpable.Perhaps one of the biggest potential recruiting sergeants for the far-right when it comes to the environment would be any greening of industry which hurts rather than helps ordinary workers. Extremists could step in and say that they are the ones who can offer ecology and protect the poor.Already, therersquos widespread suspicion across the west that some environmental policies have done more for big business and the middle classes than either the planet or the poorest. The Yellow Vest protests in France were triggered after a backlash against green taxes which were seen to hurt the worse off in society.Josep Borrell, the EUrsquos new foreign policy chief, was recently attacked for comments he made about young climate activists. He said: ldquoI would like to knowyoung people demonstrating in Berlin hellip are willing to lower their living standards to offer compensation to Polish miners, becausewe fight against climate change for real they will lose their jobs and will have to be subsidised.Borrell may have offended supporters of Greta Thunberg, but there is a genuine risk thatany Green New Deal is executed in a way which isnrsquot socially fair, this would be a fatal error easy to exploit by a far-right movement thatrsquos starting to embrace environmentalism.The concerns about Polish miners are on point. Poland is heavily dependent on coal, and Warsaw has refused to sign up to the EUrsquos  climate targets, which would lead to coal mining being phased out.There are complaints in Romania that plans to reskill miners have benefited decarbonisation firms rather than workers. Firms are making money from the \"reskilling\" market, but jobs and investment in new sectors havenrsquot appeared.Larry Fink, head of BlackRock, one of the worldrsquos largest asset management companies, has said that because of decarbonisation ldquowe are on the edge of fundamentally reshaping finance. Could the creation of a post-pandemic green economy benefit the rich, not the poor ldquoThe danger is that the public money hellip put into greening the European economy will instead merely subsidise greenwashing, says Daniela Gabor, professor of economics and macrofinance at UWE Bristol.In other words, taxes pay for big business to show off green credentials. Meanwhile, jobs are lost, no new jobs are created, and the planet isnrsquot helped.Itrsquos a recipe for public cynicism, and risks a popular rejection of mainstream political attempts to fix the climate crisis.Labourrsquos Keir Starmer has warned that any Green New Deal must ldquomean good jobs in new green industries. Starmer says we need to recognise that ldquothe poorest bear the least responsibility and the heaviest burden of climate breakdown.The development of eco-fascism also coincides with the growing crisis for democracy in the western world. Dissatisfaction with democracy is at a record high, particularly in Britain and America. One study by the University of Cambridge found that % of those questioned were dissatisfied with democracy.ldquoAcross the globe, democracy is in a state of malaise, said the reportrsquos author, Roberto Foa. Ominously, the economic crash and the refugee crisis are both seen as contributing to dissatisfaction with democracy. Now coronavirus has arrived as a new peril.The study suggests that the rise of populism is not a cause of dissatisfaction but a symptom.In the UK, for example, satisfaction with democracy rose steadily from the s for some  years ndash peaking just after the millennium.At the same time as the appeal of democracy waned, fears over the climate rose sharply. Developed and industrialised nations are feeling the effects of climate change now, with floods and fires, droughts and other wild weather.The UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, says the world is ldquoway off track when it comes to dealing with the climate emergency, and time is running out.The UNrsquos assessment of global climate found that  was a record-breaking year for heat. More people are also on the move due to extreme temperatures and flooding. Once again, the connection between the environment and migration is there waiting for the far-right to step in and exploit it.In , the worldrsquos oceans were the warmest on record, with at least % of seas experiencing a heatwave. Surface air temperatures were the hottest ever recorded. For the nd year in a row, more ice was lost from glaciers than gained ndash this caused sea levels to go up to their highest since records began.Before the postponement of the UN climate summit in Glasgow due to coronavirus, Guterres was setting some hope on Scotland. ldquoWe need more ambition on [emission cuts], adaption and finance in time for the climate conference, COP, in Glasgow, UK, in November, he said, prior to the lockdown. ldquoThat is the only way to ensure a safer, more prosperous and sustainable future for all people on a healthy planet.COP stands for the th Conference of the Parties ndash the UNrsquos Climate Change Conference. When the conference was held in France in  it adopted the Paris Agreement and signalled a step-change in how the world looked at the climate crisis, with nearly  nations agreeing ambitious goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions and limit temperature rises.The Glasgow climate conference is now delayed until , but calls remain for it to kickstart a new green tech revolution. Researchers at Oxford University, led by Mike Mason of the School of Enterprise and the Environment, believe harnessing new technology could reduce carbon emissions by at least one billion tonnes a year.Examples of new green technology include converting cheap renewable energy ndash from wind, sun or wave ndash into zero-carbon fuel.But any Green New Deal needs to work for people as well as the planet. Unless ordinary workers are brought along, with new jobs and decent wages, then the fracture point between the economy and ecology will be a gt to extremists.Too often green measures are seen as hurting the poorest. A ban in England on the sale of wet wood and coal for domestic fireplaces, for example, was criticised for pushing people in rural areas into poverty.For Naomi Klein the rise of eco-fascism means that while therersquos a growing tendency among far-right extremists to no longer deny climate change, what they will continue to deny is any common humanity between people across the world.A far-right vision of environmentalism will be Darwinian, a brutal case of \"us versus them\", of pulling up the drawbridge. If we donrsquot act quickly and intelligently, then race and immigration could soon come to contaminate the debate about the environment.ldquoLet there be no mistake, says Klein. ldquoThis is the dawn of climate barbarism. And unless there is a radical change not only in politics but in the underlying values that govern our politics, this is how the wealthy world is going to lsquoadaptrsquo to more climate disruption: by fully unleashing the toxic ideologies that rank the relative value of human lives in order to justy the monstrous discarding of huge swathes of humanity.Klein wants to douse the flames of eco-fascism. The way to do that is to create well-paid, secure jobs for anyone whose livelihood is put at risk by the turn away from fossil fuels ndash and for the state to take on the burden of retraining workers of all ages. Thatrsquos the real Green New Deal. Thatrsquos the way to kill off eco-fascism while itrsquos still in its cradle.THE DEEP ROOTS OF ECO-FASCISMThe far-rightrsquos move to embrace the environment as part of its ideological agenda is nothing new. Itrsquos just been dormant for a long time.As with much of modern fascism, its roots lie in Nazi Germany. Nazi ideology hinged around the concept of \"Blood and Soil\" ndash the idea that Aryans had a mystical connection to their nation and a duty to protect the land.There was an almost romantic obsession with rural le in Nazi Germany, and it was seen as superior to urban living. Many Hitler Youth were sent to work on farms as ldquoonly those of German blood may be farmers.The Blood and Soil ideology found its most perverse outlet in the shape of both Nazi eugenics and lebensraum, the idea that German people should expand into lands once owned by their German ancestors. Nazi art and film also gloried nature.The first eco-terrorist was neither right nor left. Ted Kaczynski, otherwise known as the Unabomber, was a former mathematics professor who left society and his career to live off grid in the wilds of Montana.He saw himself as a revolutionary destined to overthrow ldquothe system and despised technology. Between  and , he killed three people and injured  others in a series of bomb attacks across the USA against universities, airlines and other industrial targets. Kaczynski even tried to bring down a passenger jet.Like todayrsquos eco-fascists, Kaczynski wrote his own manesto entitled Industrial Society and its Future, in which he justied his bombings by saying that modern le was destroying humanity. The manesto begins: ldquoThe Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race.Kaczynski was arrested in  by the FBI and is now serving le without the possibility of parole in a federal supermax prison."},{"url":null,"title":"unremembered-scotland-new-book-reveals-fascinating-snippets-nations-history","story":"Getting there had involved overcoming the forces of nature, biding time for tides and the weather to align in an act of grace that would allow a small craft to be hauled on to the narrow, shingle beach.Patience was rewarded. As Patrick Baker paddled his kayak past wobbling purple and white jellyfish and the occasional porpoise, battling to beat the temperamental currents, the deserted island of Belnahua took shape.Once ashore, he trekked over the beach and the overgrown grass to reach deserted terraced homes where dozens of slate quarry workers and their families once lived. Long since abandoned, the dilapidated walls and rusting machinery remain rooted, crumbling monuments to an almost forgotten age when Scottish island mined slate put a roof over the world.ldquoBelnahua was very ghostly, says Baker, an Edinburgh-based outdoor writer whose new book The Unremembered Placesexplores some of Scotlandrsquos wild, often overlooked locations and unravels the fascinating stories embedded in their past.ldquoIt was eerie and poignant and beautul, he continues. ldquoThe journey to Belnahua adds to its mystique. The island has that rare frozen-in-time quality to it.ldquoLots of the places I ended up visiting had that same feeling.Part travelogue and part social history, Baker has recorded his journeys to locations that have fallen off the beaten track: hidden caves, a quiet Highland reservoir with a deadly human toll linked to its construction, and secluded islands.Despite doing the footwork to become familiar with each before setting off, often these \"unremembered\" places still managed to capture Baker off-guard either by their enigmatic beauty or a tiny detail that shed new light on their seldom-told histories.At Belnahua, once at the epicentre of a mammoth slate industry which saw it and its neighbouring islands send Dalradian slate around the world, Baker picked his way through the \"ghost village\" with its abandoned homes, corroded machinery, rusted steam-driven crane and flooded quarries.Beyond the physical remains, he unravelled a much deeper story of island communities surrounded by turbulent waters which carried an astonishing number of vessels ndash a fair number of which would end up wrecked as they battled against the harsh, stormy Atlantic waters.ldquoThat brutality of the winter storms and their location on the edge of the Atlantic, would have made it an incredible place to live, says Baker. ldquoAt one point the water around Belnahua was one of the busiest watercourses around the UK, which is incredible to think of.A series of economic and natural calamities including a storm which Baker describes as being ldquoof epic proportions devastated the industry, leaving ft deep mines flooded by the swell of seawater which drenched their workings, and families with no work or reason to stay.Once home to more than  people at the slate industryrsquos peak at the end of the th century, by the s the island was empty.ldquoIt feels like it has been deserted, reflects Baker, whose book links the growth of the slate industry with bustling sea traffic and the rise of lighthouses to guide vessels on their way.ldquoIt was a rapid turnaround of being a very populated island with many people living on a tiny patch of land, to being completely deserted within a matter of weeks.ldquoIt has a feeling of rapid desertion to it. Itrsquos quite eerie but fascinating with machinery lying where it was left and no-one going to remove it.ldquoThe houses are there, he adds. ldquoBut what struck me was the row of deserted cottages which housed the slate miners and their families.ldquoIt banks to a small beach that is just footsteps from the front door to the water. I stood there and thought what an incredible place to live, but equally what a very hard and brutal place.ldquoItrsquos only really when you visit these places that you can transpose yourself into what it must have been like to live there and experience that.ldquoAnd Belnhua is very visceral and very real.While some \"unremembered\" spots are remote and challenging to reach, such as Blackwater Reservoir in Lochaber where he was taken aback by the small graveyard and the human cost of creating the dam, others are far closer to urban le.The Glen Loin Caves near Arrochar in West Dunbartonshire are the reputed resting point for Robert the Bruce and his army after the Battle of Methven in . However, Baker points out that much more recently they were a focal point for working-class sporting prowess.For two decades from the s, groups from the hard-working shipyards and poverty-stricken Glasgow tenements made the area their playground, taking up weekend residence in the caves from where they would climb the rocky walls of the \"Arrochar Alps\".The climbing clubs they formed would go on to lay the foundations for the sportrsquos modern standards, techniques and ethics.However, as years passed, the location of the caves they frequented became largely forgotten Bakerrsquos search for them resulting in a frustrating challenge over jagged rocks, through pines and across overgrown gashes in the hillside before finally stumbling into the dark, gaping entrance.ldquoSome of the places are pretty remote and hard to get to which may be a discouragement to people seeking to visit them, says Baker, as he explains the balance to be struck between drawing attention to secluded, forgotten spots and attracting people to visit.ldquoWe want to share the wonderment we are seeing and share these stories, he adds, ldquobut we donrsquot want to degrade the places or their mystery.Thatrsquos a particular issue for the \"wild\" islands he visits, dotted across Loch Awe and Loch Shiel, havens for wildle, some harbouring centuries-old graveyards or, in the case of Eilean Fhianain, once home to Irish missionary Saint Finnan and with its ruined chapel and burial grounds.Other islands revealed another side to their previously well-documented character.Baker explored Inchkeith Island, three miles north of Edinburgh in the Firth of Forth, aware of its prominence as a stop-off point for vessels between Fe and Edinburgh since the th century but surprised to discover its links to a bizarre attempt to invade the Port of Leith.ldquoI often had an idea about the story that was going to unravel in a particular place, and then found out other elements, says Baker, whose book covers eight destinations, each with its own character and signicance.ldquoIt was fascinating to find out about Inchkeithrsquos strategic importance and how, in , it was used as a sort of staging post for a fleet under the command of Scots-born John Paul Jones, who effectively founded the US Navy.A squadron of five ships had gathered at the mouth of the estuary near Dunbar, sparking panic in towns along the coast.Sailing under a commission for the Continental Navy for the American Colonies, John Paul Jones was known for attacking British naval and merchant ships and launching land offensives.His sights on this occasion, writes Baker, were set on Leith.Having penned a letter threatening to attack the port, his vessels took anchor at Inchkeith Island to await their next move.As luck had it, a fierce westerly gale put paid to Jonesrsquos plans. Having been prevented from reaching the port, Jones decided it was ldquoimpossible to pursue the enterprise with a good prospect of success.Baker, who has previously written about stories and landscape of the Cairngorms, says while the \"unremembered\" locations explored in his book may seem disparate, they share common links.ldquoScotlandrsquos wild histories ... speak of immeasurable social change, of the movement of people through time and landscape, he writes. ldquoYet they are often lost, overlooked or passed by.ldquoThey still have cultural relevance, but we donrsquot tend to give them enough signicance. Thatrsquos the common theme.The Unremembered Places by Patrick Baker is published by Birlinn on May "},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  39 s Country Life  an army at work on the home front","story":"It wasnrsquot until we moved to the country that I needed a diary the way fish need water.

There was one young man who, unbeknownst to us, was clambering around our rooftop without any sign of a harness, nearly giving our neighbour across the green palpitations. For the space of five days while he worked, the front door stood wide open ndash it was January ndash but when I askedthe cold bothered him, he said he liked it. He never put the heating on in his flat.Two months later, in the wake of the Beast from the East, the kitchen was installed and the door stood ajar for a further five days. This time I had to work upstairs, typing in rhythm to the bass beat on the joinerrsquos radio, and thereby generating a frisson of heat. He too seemed not to notice the Arctic blast. All of them seem exceptionally tough and strong. Which is just as well, because therersquos a lot more work still to do."},{"url":null,"title":"rab-mcneil-retail-rules-exercise-obsession-load-bs","story":"I DONrsquoT want to be one of those people who complain about the behaviour of others during the coronavirus. Everyone has a story to tell, and my brief one simply involves a visit to the supermarket.This is a nerve-wracking experience now, less frequent than it used to be and hedged in with so many rules that you fear breaking merely through forgetfulness or habit. So you approach the entrance, saying to yourself: ldquoRemember to do this and not to do that. Donrsquot get into a fight. Donrsquot pick your nose.And then you get in and find a young woman blocking the narrow entrance aisle so nobody can get past, while she texts something. At last, after causing a back-up at the door, she finally finishes and, ignoring the wipes and free gloves, goes over to the fruit and veg, where she starts picking up ious peppers with her hands, testing them before putting them back. Unbelievable.I mention it partly to tell you a story about something even more unbelievable that I saw in a supermarket back in BV . This middle-aged woman was doing the same as the young pepper-woman, only with bakery rolls. She picked up several and felt them for consistency. Then, when she had made her selection, she used the provided tongs to put them in her bag.Somewhere in her brain she must have acknowledged that you were supposed to use the tongs, but she hadnrsquot computed that these were provided to stop you handling the products. They were just ... one of these things. They were a matter of etiquette, like the peculiar array of culinary implements that posh people provide for ious dferent dishes.Well, now theyrsquore telling us that etiquette is going to change forever AV . As regards tongs, theyrsquoll be used for all sorts of shopping and yoursquoll be urged to bring your own. Sounds like a plan, even though you can fair mangle a Danish pastry with them sometimes.Therersquos also that moment when you fear yoursquore going to drop your item. Imagine the embarrassment that would cause now. Yoursquod be surrounded by security guards with tasers, as alarms shrieked and crime scene tape was placed round the floored bakery product.Other new social rules include excellent news about the discouraging of kissing and hugging outside family members or a ldquobubble of close friends. Oh joy. If only it could be extended to include family friends and friends. Imagine a ban on cheek-kissing. Le would be so much better.In future, pedestrians will be urged to walk on the right side of the pavement, which I think is already the case with London escalators. But, on the escalators, thatrsquos to allow busy, important people to overtake.You know that people will just do the same on the pavements as they already do on the roads when you leave a decent distance between you and the car in front, and the impatient maddies overtake into it and fill up the space.So much for humans. Animals will also be affected by the new rules. Cats will be kept indoors, meaning the gardens of neighbours wonrsquot be so full of excreta and mangled songbirds.Back to humans, and another revolutionary suggestion is that muzak could be turned off in shops so that people didnrsquot have to move closer to each other to hear what theyrsquore saying.Yoursquove got to admit this is all rather grand. Itrsquos just a shame that it took something so calamitous and horrible as the coronavirus to bring it about.Busy keeping busyWHENCE this mania for exercise  Folk whorsquove never lted a finger before are now waddling aboot in the parks and public spaces. They have taken the Governmentrsquos advice about ldquoonce a day as instruction rather than restriction.Indeed, experts are now warning the lieges about overdoing it and injuring themselves. I nearly did that myself when, bereft of my weekly gym visit, I rescued a whole load of equipment from the garden shed and the attic, and nearly broke my back trying to assemble it.I must say though that, once it was up and running, and I had a wee go on it, I felt marvellous afterwards. Endorphins and whatnot whizzed round my heid and I said to myself: ldquoI must do this more often.Never done it again since. The stuff just sits there in the spare bedroom, or man-cave, along with all the guitars I canrsquot play and woodworking and DIY tools that I canrsquot work.Instead, I have concentrated on exercising my mind, catching up with a load of reading of actual books. This form of exercise, conducted in a seating position, has been really good for my glutes.I mean my butt getting much bigger is a good thing, right Five things we learned this week King James I of Scotland climbed down his toilet in a doomed attempt to escape assassins. Not a cludgie as we know it ndash tricky getting down one of these ndash but a cesspit, down which he found himself without a paddle. Every cloud etc. Coronavirus could be good for yellow rattle, knapweed, wood calamint and scabious. Council verges going uncut has benefited wild flowers but also bees, butterflies, birds, bats and bugs. Mind you, they sound like a right load of brsquos. Things look more cloudy for beer. Millions of pints are going to waste with coronavirus keeping pubs closed. Some beers only last six weeks in pubs. Mind you, thatrsquos five weeks and six days more than they do in our house. A rare bottle of whisky could fetch pound. million in an online auction tomorrow. The Macallan  is described as the ldquoholy grail of whisky.

Very slowly beat in the caster sugar. I do this one teaspoon at a time to ensure the air stays in the mixture. When all the sugar has been added, mix the vanilla, vinegar and cornflour and then beat into the meringue. Rather than using a baking sheet lined with parchment I use a ceramic pie dishand oil very lightly. I serve the pavlova in this dish so it looks pretty and stops the chances of the meringue breaking. Fill the dish with thick scoops of the mixture to form the pavlova shape and bake in a preheated oven for  minutes then turn off the oven and leave for a further  minutes. Remove the dish from the oven and allow to cool. Meanwhile heat one punnet of raspberries with the icing sugar in a pan until the raspberries start to pop and the sugar has dissolved. Cook for about  or  minutes, stirring to ensure the mixture doesnt burn. Cool and then sieve the seeds to make a coulis and add the strawberries to the coulis. Whip the double cream until soft peaks form and then spoon the cream onto the pavlova and then dress with the strawberry mixture."},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown-recipe-umi-edinburgh-teriyaki-salmon-plus-use-chopsticks","story":"Umi was opened with the aim of bringing authentic Japanese ramen to Scotlandrsquos capital ndash they believe ramen can bring joy and happiness to a dinerrsquos day.Red paper lanterns, horigotatsu tables with cushions, shoji doors, rattan chairs and murals reflecting the Japanese street scene create a traditional, immersive and bustling atmosphere.

But for many, that might just be how we are feeling today.\"For some couples this could be an unexpected bonus, but no doubt for many others the lockdown will see a whole new experience develop, one marked by irritations, annoying habits and arguments.

Many couples are finding the need to develop new routines and new ways of managing their days. There are ways to make things a little better.\"Dr Clare Daly, director, doctorate in educational psychology at the University of Strathclyde, said the first few weeks were a time of uncertainty and perhaps a bit of a novelty. However, she added that as the lockdown continues it is beginning to feel like this is the new normal.Daly said: \"Clear feelings of anxiety may have passed. However, a more deep-routed anxiety may be more apparent through your or your partnerrsquos behaviours at home, for example increasing feelings of anger, disrupted sleeping, lack of focus, avoidance, over-planning, negativity.\"We are being bombarded with stimulating things to do, an array of new, mostly free hobbies to try out at home, and social media has gone wild with perfectrsquo lockdown family photos, which can be overwhelming.

For example, extroverts may be drawn to introverts seemingly more relaxed and mysterious attitude whereas introverts can benefit from an extrovert taking them out of their comfort zone.She added: \"In normal times this can create a delicate balance in a relationship, however during lockdown this could cause serious friction. In this instance, both partners will have very dferent styles of coping with the pandemic now is not the time to make big decisions. Some will have a stronger tolerance for ambiguity while their partner may have a greater need for structure and routine.

I had to get used to a way of working from home and my husband Scott has been furloughed from work and has effectively become a stay-at-home dad. I have been lsquopretendingrsquo to go to work every day to Thea which has meant me hiding upstairs and coming back for lunch and saying lsquomummyrsquos home. I had been at home with Thea on maternity leave so I know it is a lot for Scott as he is doing the bulk of the childcare during the day.ldquoThere have been some challenges with lockdown but it has been nice to have that extra family time. We have a very close extended family and even go on holidays together, so it has made a nice change to be on our own. I think it has brought us closer together having that unided family time. Although there are moments when I think he needs time on projects in the garage.Husband Scott said although Fiona working from home isnt new although the fact she is having to sneak up to the attic with coffee so their toddler doesnt get upset at her coming and going certainly is.He said: ldquoThe good side of it is getting more family time. Im planning lots of fun activities to keep our daughter entertained and Fiona and I are still having movie nights and making nice meals together to help make le feel as normal as it can be right now.Scott added: ldquoIts given me a new appreciation for Fiona. Her work has a flexible working policy, so she tends to be at home more with Thea. I now understand why she could be so frazzled after a day at home.\"The hard parts are definitely the uncertainty and worrying about family. But also the lack of time to myself, even the drive to work is good thinking time that I used to take for granted.

Of four Scottish publishers I spoke to last week, the best cited a  per cent fall in paid-for advertising and two reported it had all but vanished.Last week two other Scottish weekly papers were forced to suspend publication, the West Highland Free Press and the Stranraer  Wigtownshire Free Press, and while their publishers have every intention of ing to print there are no guarantees. So the money from the UK Government advertising campaign canrsquot arrive a moment too soon.Mr Dowden has also written to producers of the UKrsquos  biggest brands to make sure their online advertising policies do not block ads from appearing next to news about the pandemic, as some have been doing, because not only is the information providing a public service, but virus stories are so dominant that such a block is effectively an advertising ban.So Mr Dowden and Michael Gove in the Cabinet Office ndash a former reporter for Aberdeenrsquos Press  Journal ndash are doing what they can to help the newspaper industry survive the crisis, but the Scottish Government also has a role to play. The Scottish Newspaper Society has been in constant dialogue with Scottish ministers and civil servants for the past four weeks to try to achieve similar support for the sector here, and among the requests are an extension of the business rates holiday to news publishers, a support fund and more government advertising as the UK Government has just done.Other countries have launched news support programmes, like Denmark where the government is paying compensation for advertising losses of up to  per cent from a media fund worth poundm, and the devolved Flanders government in Belgium, which also has a compensation package for lost revenues as part of a poundm fund for sport, culture and media. A package is also under discussion in Ireland and most other European countries are working up support programmes.The Scottish Government included newsagents in the list of permitted retailers and acknowledged that journalism and newspaper production is a key service, a crucial recognition which allowed publishers to continue printing, distributing and selling their titles, so there is no doubt that ministers accept the sectorrsquos value. With some , people working full-time in Scottish news publishing and  per cent of all adults using Scottish news brands every month, it would be quite somethingthey didnrsquot.On a very basic level, those , jobs depend on it, as does the flow of trusted and authenticated information, but so too does community cohesion and the continuity historic titles provide in recording and reflecting events large and small in momentous times such as we are experiencing now.However, recognition will count for nothingnews businesses are no longer financially viable, so we hope the Scottish Government will follow the example of legislatures across Europe and beyond and back up their words with deeds.ldquoNewspapers are at heart of the British media and essential to its vibrant mix, wrote Mr Dowden. And that certainly includes Scotland.John McLellan is Director of the Scottish Newspaper Society"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"April ,  at : pmADVERTORIAL: Isuzu D-Max Eiger  BHP Double Cab # £, +VAT +Road Tax Isuzu # The pick-up professionals.

Points will be awarded for such things as being able to speak English, having a job already lined up and meeting appropriate skill levels. They will also have to meet a minimum salary threshold, which the guidance informs is generally £,, although a lower salary might be accepted in some circumstances.Under this new system, low-skilled workers will not be able to receive visas to live and work in the UK.The new system however, will not apply to EU citizens already living in the UK by December , this year. They will be eligible to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme.Highlighting the impact immigrants have had in the fight against coronavirus, Mr Carmichael called on the government to rethink its plans and support key workers.“When the immigration proposals were first announced earlier in the year I called them short-sighted and a risk to the long-term future of island communities,” he said.“We are already seeing the potential harm we risk to our communities and our country. It is time that the government started rethinking its plans.“Around the UK we are seeing the positive impact that immigrants are having as key workers in the fight against coronavirus. That the government has not reflected on this at all in developing its advice on immigration policy is disappointing. If immigrants can be essential workers in our country’s time of crisis, then they deserve our support to remain here afterwards.”Mr Carmichael added: “Last week I joined my colleague Christine Jardine in calling for foreign nationals working in the NHS in this crisis to have the right to remain. There can be no clearer case for their rights than the work they are doing right now.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

That is the eventual way out of this.#Professor Pennington, who has chaired E.coli outbreak inquiries and in , was awarded a CBE for services to microbiology, believed the system could then be recreated on a large scale in other health board areas of Scotland.#The islands have good medical facilities, but you would need to have good and effective testing facilities in place with a quick result. It would not cost a lot of money.“It would be an example for the rest of the country as long as there was an early warning system in place. It could then be possible for the Highlands and Grampian to follow.#Hotspots will not last because people will either recover or sadly die.

However, the RSPB says these birds are in serious trouble, with numbers plummeting in former strongholds across the UK and Europe. It is reported that the species is now vulnerable to extinction.Puffarazzi aims to find out what is causing population changes across the UK, particularly focusing on dferences in food availability related to climate change. People can join the Puffarazzi by submitting photos from visits to puffin colonies in previous years where they have snapped pictures of these colourful seabirds with food in their bills. The photos help scientists learn more about what puffins are feeding their chicks, or ‘pufflings’, and how this might have changed over time.The project first ran in  asking for photos from that summer, before ing last year with the added request for images from any year which will help build a picture of how food sources might have changed over time.The RSPB says the public response in the previous two years has been incredible:This year the project is adapting to take coronavirus guidance into account, asking people to focus on digging through their photo albums and files at home in case there are any photos tucked away from previous visits to puffin colonies that could be of use.The photos will help scientists identy areas where puffins are struggling to find enough nutritious fish needed to support their pufflings, with the historical photos providing an invaluable comparison of how food availability has changed over time.Connie Tremlett, RSPB conservation scientist and manager of the project this year, said: “We’ve been bowled over by how many people have already taken part in Puffarazzi # the response so far really shows how beloved these ‘clowns of the sea’ are, and how each and every one of us can play a part in saving them. As puffinsto our shores, we’re once again asking people to share their photos from previous years with us. However old your photo is, as long as it has a picture of a puffin with food in its beak, and you know when and where it was taken, it will help.“Those who join the Puffarazzi are filling key gaps in our knowledge, helping us to understand what threats are facing these little seabirds.

Considering his past record as a caring inidual, including his efforts to help the homeless, that was not really surprising.But apart from manager Daniel Stendl, who waived his salary, others at the Edinburgh club appeared reluctant to follow Naismith’s example. Reports later suggested that no other Hearts player would be asked to take more than a  per cent reduction.Also last week it was claimed that Scotland manager Steve Clarke had accepted a  per cent cut, simply meaning his salary would go down from £, to £,.In England the men’s and women’s international bosses Gareth Southgate and Phil Neville apparently agreed to take  per cent less. In the former’s case he would still be pocketing £. million while Neville would get £,.At club level south of the border the situation is very inconsistent. Some managers, such as David Moyes, Eddie Howe and Graham Potter have volunteered to take a cut while Pep Guardiola donated a million euros to help fight the outbreak in Spain. There was a terrible poignancy to Guardiola’s generosity a few days later when it was reported that his -year-old mother had died as a result of the virus in Barcelona.But while most Premiership clubs have placed most non-playing staff on some kind of temporary leave, some receiving  per cent of their salary through the government’s job retention scheme, the situation with the majority of players is still unclear.This is a dficult situation and UK health minister Matt Hancock ruffled some feathers when he suggested that well-off footballers should consider doing more to help.Some journalists have even criticised Hancock, saying he was completely out of touch with what was actually happening. That was unfair. The minister was not speaking about the game in general, where players at lower-level clubs are paid a pittance compared with those at the top. He was merely highlighting the fact that many could easily survive with no pay at all for the foreseeable future.To put this in perspective, most players at Premiership level are earning several million a year, an increase of roughly two and a half times what they took home six years ago. A high proportion are on more than £, a week.At the top of the tree are Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea and Man City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, who are on over £ million and £ million respectively.Even a player I confess to never having heard of, Tanguy Ndombele of Tottenham Hotspur, is reportedly bagging £. million a year.In the Championship the average annual pay is considerably less, around £, a year or £, a week. And in the lower League Two it drops to £ or £ weekly, not all that much above the national average.During the current situation all these figures need to be taken into consideration. We should have no issue with lower-paid players still getting  per cent of their wages for doing nothing. They, like everyone , still have bills to pay.But for the multi-millionaires to grumble about being hit is about as hard to take as the coronavirus pandemic itself.: : : : : : : :No decision has yet been made about whether the football leagues in the UK will be completed, whenever the action begins again.In Scotland it has been proposed in some quarters that the title should just be handed to Celtic, as the Glasgow side had an almost unassailable lead when play stopped.Now a director of the other half of the Old Firm has suggested thatthat happened, their rivals would only be able to claim “eight and a half” in a rowthey were crowned champions.Personally I feel that this season’s scheduled fixtures should be played out, however long it takes. Only then should the - action start, evenit means a shortened campaign.: : : : : : : :There are currently eight premier ision football clubs in Shetland, all of which have been in existence for dferent s of time.Scalloway are the oldest, dating back to , with Lerwick sides Celtic and Thistle being able to trace their beginnings back to the early part of the th century.Spurs and Ness United both emerged during the s, with Whitedale, Whalsay and Delting joining the senior league more recently.Someone suggested to me that a best XI from each could be selected, to give players and supporters something to ponder over during the current period of uncertainty.There will no doubt be controversy over this, but that’s what opinion is all about. If anyone would like to submit their thoughts, or their own ideas of what their respective best sides would be, feel free to send them in.Next time I will give you the line-ups, in alphabetical order, from the past  years.

It is expected to be pressed into service as soon as possible.Health board chairman said demand for testing on the Scottish mainland had seen tests take up to five days for processing.But having the kit on-island, he said, would see results turned round in a matter of hours.Mr Robinson said he recognised there had been a #hiatus# after initial testing coronavirus had stopped.#We recognised in NHS Shetland that capacity for testing was going to be an issue. Testing in Glasgow was going from  hours to five days.#I think we recognised there was a need to get something locally.# raquoNHS Shetland, like many other essential service providers, employs people whose parents and grandparents did now grow up in Shetland, or even in the UK.

It almost makes a case for education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!Reading it helped me to reflect on how dangerous it is for us to accept a narrow and rigid definition of what makes for a permissible #Shetlander#,and how important it is to reject the idea that some are entitled to more of a voice in that discussion than others.Those wishing to contest the need for such points to be made should first read Malcolm#s recommended article and then reflect on how recently a SMUHA squad featured a black-faced member of the NHS.As the article points out there is a prospect that this visus will not lead to more harmonious societies.The price of the peaceful cooperation we should wish for with all our neighboursis vigilance against those who would needlessly turn us against each other.Ilove how Peter and Malcolm appear to be so in veneration of each other, just a tad too preachy for me. As for #an education in the humanities to be compulsory into adulthood!# I would respectfully suggest a basis eduction in the STEM subjects would be of far more value to humankind. That way most would understand what a virus is, how a vaccine works. The sort of simple science stuff that lives depend on.Humanities educated, Like Boris Johson and Rees Mogg. Go for it, Peter!One hesitates to perturb so a warm a socialist embrace. However, re the linked article, any author who discusses Nazism and bigotry in one breath and then Trump, Bolsonaro and Modi in the next while omitting to mention China’s Xi Jinping or the North Korean monster, Kim Jong-un, is clearly peddling a dishonest agenda.It#s a wonder people #educated in the humanities# didn#t see that. Interesting.Having installed himself as president for le, Xi is reportedly responsible for the most appalling, vicious repression and imprisonment of a million Uighur people and the relentless destruction of their culture in China’s Xinjiang province.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run. Both he and namesake Fraser # the full back in the epic tussle of  – would again pick up winners’ medals in , by which time Kenny’s son Roddy had also emerged as a star of the sport.For Skye the wait for another shot at the big one goes on – with the club also missing out in semi finals in  and .Allan MacLeod, the current Skye co-manager, reflected on that game at Ballachulish – recalling that he played much of the first half without a contact lens.“I remember marking Dan MacRae – a fantastic player. But it was great chance for us.“We were the better side for much of it, but not for the first time Kenny MacDonald was the saviour for Kyles.“At the time Kingussie were virtually unstoppable and we’d have met them in their prime. Our chance of winning the cup may have been slim, but it would have been nice to have made the final.“A lot of that Skye team would have deserved a shot on that stage.”The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until st May .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Covid-19.jpg","title":"details of covid 19 case on skye leaked to the free","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAs of Friday th April, there were a total of  confirmed cases in the NHS Highland area, but the health board have not released any further details on where the cases originate.Amid fears that some people might still consider rural areas to be isolated and virus free, there have been calls for greater clarity on where cases are.

It was a Saturday afternoon and the game was a supposed friendly against Rothienorman.“Back then I was a hard man, or so I thought! I was up against a burly young farmer-type at centre-half. I had a couple of robust challenges with the lad and he warned me that next time he was having me! Two minutes later he came in from behind and elbowed me in the head, I shrugged it off and instead of walking away I turned around and said: #You ain’t big enough to put me down, kid.# The next thing I knew, the birds were tweeting around my head and my front teeth were missing!“The game was abandoned and I had to go to the emergency dentist that afternoon and had months of repair work afterward.

That lives long in the memory!” “It won#t come as a surprise to learn the best match was the title-winning game on th August , for many emotional reasons. We had a great campaign that year and had won  out of  games with only three matches remaining. We had to go to Kyleakin away on this date and they were the only team who could catch us in the title challenge.“It was a really nice summer evening and we had a strong team out, although leading striker John Murphy was unavailable through injury which meant young James Pringle played upfront with Craig Brown.“Kyleakin got out of the blocks quickly and we found ourselves - down early on in the match in front of a big crowd. We settled after that and played some decent stuff but Kyleakin, as usual, were well marshalled by Michael Taylor and we had dficulty in creating clear-cut opportunities. However, with  minutes to go, coach Ian MacLeod and I decided to put youngsters Ian Morrison and Angie MacPherson on each touchline to give us pace and width. The freshness seemed to galvanise us and with  minutes to go, we pulled a goal back through Craig Brown. It seemed the whole match swung on that goal, we picked up some real momentum and Brown scored again to equalise. Then with five minutes to go, we were awarded a penalty with two Kyleakin defenders tackling Brown as he broke into the box. Craig dusted himself down and scored the penalty in off the post # we were delirious on the sidelines. We saw out the game for our first-ever title and then won the remaining two games to make it  wins from  matches # it was a campaign never to be forgotten!” “It was my first game in charge, and funnily enough, it was also against Kyleakin. In those campaigns it was always the case that the first game of the season in the Bagshaw League pitted the reigning champions against the team which finished bottom the season before. The bottom club then had to play the runners-up from the previous season and so on, so it was very dficult for the clubs at the bottom to gain any early momentum.“We went down to Kyleakin with a whole bunch of youngsters against the likes of Scott Graham, the Nisbett clan, Darren Wainwright # who were all top players in the league at that time. We lost - and I swearit wasn#t for our young goalie Calum Montgomery making one save it could have been . But in essence, that is where I started from in management.

The places where one would most clearly feel the presence of spiritual community are cut off – never mind that a pandemic might tempt one to question faith in any deity. Here in the Highlands many still can access the temple of nature, but for some even that temple is essentially out of bounds. We are exiled in our own homes.The theme of exile for some wrong-doing – not necessarily a penance but for something perceived as wrong by others – is, of course, international, never more so than right now.In the Gàidhealtachd, however, with a history of mass emigration, exile retained a particular relevance well into modern times. So I have gone to Tobar an Dualchais and to Dugald Buchanan, forthere was anyone who understood the agony of spiritual exile and the loneliness of doubt and fear and who grappled with them with profound courage, it was him.Buchanan lived from -, part of the time among the broken men of Rannoch, amongst whom he taught and preached. He was sent by the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge in . He was to be a teacher and a catechist: the catechism was a sort of question and answer method of teaching religion, and its spiritual values.The place Buchanan was sent to was Kinloch Rannoch, and it was in dire need of religion and spiritual values. It was on the edge of Rannoch Moor and was so remote that all the rejects of society – outlaws, dispossessed and banished, had gathered there, as far from the law as possible.The broken men of Rannoch were a people destitute and desperate. In ministering to these last vestiges of society, Buchanan was working at its roots, not certainthey were strong or rotten, not certainhis own motives were good or bad.In Buchanan’s imagery, we engage powerfully with a Dante-esque poetic imagery:Each limb, each member – foot and hand, that ever buried were in land or sea or battle-field, shall come together. Loud is the noise among the bones, each coming to its place..In the five verses Robertson has chosen out of one hundred and twenty-one, the last trumpet is heard and the mountains pour out lava.“Quench your thirst with it, you horders of gold”. The sun is in mourning, the moon steeped in blood, the stars are shaken.The poem is terrying, and the hope of salvation depends not upon anything one does oneself, other than placing one’s trust entirely in God’s mercy. This is not something you earn: it is something you have to be given. And yet this solemn song, with its simple pentatonic melody, verse after verse, has a beautul and hypnotic power.I am no believer, but this is powerful stuff and not to be lightly dismissed.Confronting the great dilemmas of self-consciousness in his confessional diary and his poetry, Buchanan emerges triumphant and yet sober, thoughtful and grateful. # The Skull # came to Buchanan when, following a young woman’s burial, he picked up a skull left exposed in Lassintulloch graveyard near Loch Rannoch.Today, the graveyard is as neglected as were the people living there in Buchanan’s day. Picture him then among the tombstones, looking out northward and the thoughts racing through his mind like the wind through the branches of the surrounding trees as he addresses the skull in his hands.He asks the skullit belonged to a preacher and did the preacher care for his flock or leave them to the care of the fox  Buchanan ends assured that there is hope even in the grave, that the eyes that were once in the skull may shine again as brilliantly as the stars, and that the soul may fly to Christ with the speed of the eagle # to be greeted with love.., back in . I hope that recording will make its way into Tobar an Dualchais one day.I met Willie Matheson just the once long ago – Allan insisted I come with him to the hospital where Willie was in a wheelchair, frail but with bright eyes and a welcome smile.

His quick wit and humour were enjoyed by his nieces and nephews who thought the world of him.Liz explained how a doctor had phoned her sister before he died and assured her staff would be with him.The doctors and nurses handled the situation so professionally and were exceptional in their care and treatment of David, she said.

When they die, it almost feels like a tiny part of your childhood goes, too.This week, I found out more about the woman who inspired me and the moments leading up to her death when I spoke to her children, Michael Mathers and Joanne Kirwin, who were still reeling from her passing last Thursday.Her daughter, Joanne, had a choice to make last week as her -year-old mother lay in South West Acute Hospital with Covid-: hear her distinctive voice on the telephone, possibly for the last time, or let her go on a mechanical ventilator without saying a word in the hope that each breathe she took would help rid her of the coronavirus.She chose the latter, dreaming that her formidable mother would overcome the cruel disease, so she could get back to doing what she loved most spending time with her family.Joanne#s brother, Michael, faced similar agony from his home in Glasgow as he liaised with hospital staff and relayed updates back to his sister in Manchester. Both have lived away from Fermanagh for years and last week, neither of them had ever felt as far away from home nor as helpless as the invisible killer prevented them from being by their mother#s bedside.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseYvonne Mathers with grandchildren Matilda, Ella and six-month-old Ottilie FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappYvonne Mathers with grandchildren Matilda, Ella and six-month-old OttilieYvonne, a healthy mother, grandmother, sister, friend and a much-loved former teacher who inspired a generation of children, passed away while a member of the hospital#s medical team wearing a mask and a gown gently held her hand in the absence of her family. The word we keep using is shock. It#s very surreal for many reasons because in part we are in lockdown and so it doesn#t feel like it#s really happened. We#ve not gone through those rituals of mourning and that order of how you do things has not happened, Joanne told The Impartial Reporter.I thought I probably shouldn#t call hershe was going on the ventilator JoanneWe knew the coronavirus was coming we all heard about it, but without sounding arrogant about it, a lot of us thought it wouldn#t happen to us. It hasn#t really hit us yet, it feels like something you see on TV, she said.Joanne recalled the moment her mother was advised to go on a ventilator, explaining how she toyed with the idea of phoning her, having spent time exchanging text messages.I thought I probably shouldn#t call hershe was going on the ventilator. She was probably going to be quite breathless and I didn#t want to take that breath from her.Part of me thinks should I have, then the selfish part of me wants to remember her voice and when I last saw her and how happy and healthy she was, she said.Joanne smiles as she recalls her mother#s love for her children Matilda, five, and six-month-old Ottilie and their love for her.She always encouraged us, she always wanted the best for us. She always wanted me and Michael to be happy and be settled and not have to worry about us, she said.Yvonne had worked for the Western Education and Library Board Advisory Service and previously taught at Jones Memorial Primary School.She did take the teacher in her home, laughed Joanne.Michael and I had to remind her that #we are home now and are not your pupils#! She could be in teacher mode as most teachers tend to be, so there were overlaps with school and home le, she said.While Yvonne adored teaching, she told Joanne that her biggest joy was having grandchildren, joking that she liked being able to hand them back.She loved having grandchildren apart from the fact she said it made her feel old. She used to come over to Manchester, but it wasn#t to see me, the only reason was to see the girls! They brought her real joy, she said.With her mother now gone so too is a part of her, admits Joanne.I am  now, but I always had somewhere to go. She used to say no matter what age her children were, she was always our mum. But no matter what age you are, you#ve lost your mum, that place to go, that sense of safety that you don#t think you need when you#re .But when it#s gone, you#ve lost that, there is a hole, that driving force is no more. I will never forget the love and happiness she got from the girls and how happy she made them, as well as how happy they made her, she said.Mum was taking all the precautions MichaelScattered around Yvonne#s now-empty home at Ashbourne Manor - where last week, neighbours took to the street to hold a poignant vigil for her - are bottles of hand sanitiser, an indication of how seriously she was taking the pandemic. When her son, Michael, arrived at the weekend, having travelled back for her burial outside Portadown, where she was originally from, he found evidence of how worried his mother, who was prone to chest infections, was.Mum was taking all the precautions, he said, describing his shock.Even when she got the positive case, we thought, #Sure you#re strong enough to work through it#, and then when we got the call on Thursday of last week at .pm, the nurses were saying she seemed quite stable, then by half five, we got a call that she was not going to make it and by seven o#clock, she had passed away. That#s a microcosm of how I am feeling it is so up and down, he said.After feeling ill for more than a week, Yvonne had a choice of going into hospital and took it, believing that she was in the right place.Even in this period, she was still making smart decisions. She was very self-aware, she took it in her stride. She said, #That#s what I have got#, and spoke very positively of the nurses.The last I spoke to her on the Sunday night, she was getting tired she was advised to go on the ventilator and thought it was the right thing to do.She recognised what she needed to do, so all of her choices were the right ones at the right time, said Michael.His mother was hugely supportive, he says, particularly during dficult periods of his le.She told me, #You are always going to be my son#. She was very encouraging, but she was very direct when she needed to be, very black and white, no real nonsense.If she needed to tell you to pull your socks up, that#s what she did in a loving and caring way. She kept us all together and I couldn#t have asked for more throughout my le.Among the children she has inspired is Michael#s daughter, Ella, who is now eight-and-a-half.The biggest regret is that she is not here to see Ella, Matilda or Ottilie grow up and become women themselves. That#s the biggest challenge in the future, encountering birthdays and looking around the room and realising that she#s not there.She wasn#t just a mother, or a grandmother, or a friend. She was an important role model in many people#s lives, he said.This was true.I once got  out of  in my spellings and she asked me what I had for breakfast.Coco Pops, I replied. She laughed and told the rest of my class to eat Coco Pops.I remember telling mum we had to buy some, texted my old classmate, Roisin Francis, this week.It takes a big heart to shape little minds.Mrs Mathers had a huge heart and didn#t just teach, she touched all our lives.

There#s disappointment that my future has been taken out of my control and, for me and many of my friends, I know those final few yards can make all the dference in what grades we achieve, what university we will go to and what future is ahead for us all.I have been worried about whether I have done enough to get the grades I need, and I have four more months until August to sit and wait to see what my future is.I didn#t do as well in mocks as I would have liked to, but it was always in my head that these were a practice run, they were not the be-all and end-all of what my final grades would be.As students we were always told that the mocks were the big chance for us to find out where we needed to improve, fix all the mistakes we were making, so I was probably like so many more pupils in seeing them as a practice run.No longer going to school, I don#t have my friends there for support like I would have and there#s no final encouragement from teachers to prepare for the exams.Of course, there is relief that I won#t spend the next few weeks worrying about having to go and take the final exams.

Of those treating Covid- patients where, over a thirdsaid they were being asked to reuse.Pat Cullen, director of the Royal College of Nursingin Northern Ireland, said: We all know that nursing staff have been under enormous pressure during this pandemic.However, it is shocking to find that nurses are feeling pressurised to work without the protection they need.The findings are from a survey conducted by the RCN to provide a snapshot of PPE shortages over the Easter weekend.Health chiefs here say they have secured millions of items from international and local suppliers.Ms Cullen added: This is an anxious and worrying time for staff, and they must have the reassurance that they can do their jobs with all of the equipment necessary.Time and time again we have been on record as saying this.It is very disappointing to find that there are still problems.Nurses carry out the majority of direct patient care and, while we acknowledge that these are extremely challenging times, we must resolve these issues. If we don#t, this will inevitably lead to further problems.The survey of local nursing staff said:Almost a quarter of nursing staff treating Covid- positive patients not on ventilators report an immediate lack of face and eye protection.Less than half of nursing staffbelieve they have enough alcohol hand rub.One in  nurses is relying on face or eye protection they have bought or homemade.Over half did not have access to either suitable changing facilitiesor washing showering facilities .Meanwhile, the NI Blood Transfusion Service came under fire from trade union Unison, which claimed front line staff in the vital service were concerned that they were not being given an adequate level of PPE to do their job safely during the Covid- pandemic.Unison#s Marianne Buick said: Staff working with blood donors feel they should have masks and visors to provide reassurance and protect both the public and the transfusion staff.What I want for our membership is that they are provided with the proper PPE to enable them to have confidence in doing their job. Not just for them, but also to reassure the blood donors who want to help the NHS during this crisis.Matt Gillespie of the NI Blood Transfusion service said that his organisation had been following World Health Organisation guidelines on PPE provision, but was moving to address the staff concerns.We will be meeting the union early next week to revise our risk assessment and see what measures we can put in place to alleviate the stress and fears that staff have, he said.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However,the gowns are not available, clinical staff treating positive patients have now been advised by the UK Department of Health to wear disposable, non-fluid repellent gowns or coveralls or washable surgical gowns, with aprons, and to wash their forearms afterwards.It also says that staff should consider reusing PPE where necessarysupplies are low.The Department of Health here said Northern Ireland#s Public Health Agency will soon be issuing new advice on when particular items such as visors can be reused depending on the area of work. But a spokesperson said: This guidance on the reuse of PPE is not implemented in Northern Ireland at this point, andor when it might be required the Department will consider this taking account of the national and scientic evidence and will provide further advise at the appropriate time.They said the Department of Health here understands staff on the frontline need reassurance. We believe the updated guidance and securing greater quantities of PPE for Northern Ireland will play a part in allaying concerns, they said, advising any staff with concerns to email . Health chiefs in Northern Ireland say they have secured millions of items from international and local suppliers.Sinn Fein health spokesperson Colm Gildernew said he spoke directly with Health Minister Robin Swann to appeal to him not to adopt the same measures on Public Health England here. Of particular concern within these revised guidelines is that single use PPE can be re-used – something such PPE is not designed to do, Mr Gildernew said. This will put frontline health staff – already putting themselves in harm’s way on a daily basis – at an increased risk.Meanwhile, a signicant number of nurses in Northern Ireland responding to a Royal College of Nursing survey conducted over the Easter weekend said they felt under pressure to work in situations where there was not adequate PPE. Nearly half of those surveyed from Northern Irelandhelping patients in such areas reported being asked to re-use items of protective equipment marked single use by manufacturers.Of those treating Covid- patients where, over a thirdsaid they were being asked to re-use.Pat Cullen, director of the Royal College of Nursingin Northern Ireland said: “We all know that nursing staff have been under enormous pressure during this pandemic, however it is shocking to find that nurses are feeling pressurised to work without the protection they need.”The Royal College of Surgeons of Englandhas also advised workers not to risk their health by working without adequate personal protective equipmentamid fears that hospitals could run out of supplies.The fear from medics comes as more than , patients have now died in hospital after testing positive for the disease in the UK, with thousands more deaths expected in care homes.A further  deaths as a result of coronavirus were announced in Northern Ireland on Saturday, along with a further  confirmed cases of the virus, in the biggest daily rise to date. It brings the total number of cases here to ,.Mr Gildernew called for the Department of Health here to offer reassurance to healthcare staff. The Department of Health needs to listen to frontline workers and their unions give assurances that the revised guidance will not be adopted here and the minister should redouble his efforts to ensure sufficient supply of PPE is secured and made available when and where it is needed.Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said a consignment of  tonnes of PPE was due to arrive in the UK from Turkey on Sunday.He said this shipment included , gowns - the supply of which NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts, said on Saturday was now critical. Supply in some areas, particularly gowns and certain types of masks and aprons, is in short supply at the moment, and that must be an extremely anxious time for people working on the front line, Mr Jenrick said, But they should be assured that we are doing everything we can to correct this issue, and to get them the equipment that they need.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ede-ee-c--ddeecdbf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ede-ee-c--ddeecdbf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ede-ee-c--ddeecdbf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ede-ee-c--ddeecdbf_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland  .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ede-ee-c--ddeecdbf_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandCoronavirus updates: UK government pledges extra £m in funding as  further deaths confirmed in Northern IrelandThe UK government has said they will provide an extra £ million towards tackling the coronavirus crisis in Northern Ireland.Most ReadLawyers who acted for Paddy Jackson in rugby rape trial sue Rory Best for libel Near-tragedy brings clarity on Covid- lockdown to BBC Radio Ulster broadcaster Familiar Northern Ireland faces roll back years for some #Me At # photo funCo Down crash victim Matthew Stuart a cancer survivor who was due to wed in Coronavirus updates: UK government pledges extra £m in funding as  further deaths confirmed in Northern Ireland,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In Northern Ireland testing is currently limited to patients who are being admitted to hospital and some health care workers as well as symptomatic nursing home residents. At the time of writing, April , just over , people have been tested for the virus in the North with under , confirmed cases. Whereas more than , tests for Covid- have now been completed in the Republic of Ireland – one of the highest testing rates in Europe - resulting in over , confirmed cases. googletag.cmd.push In the south you can phone your GP to be assessed for a testyou are in a priority group and have symptoms. Andyou are in a priority group and have been in contact with someone you think or know has coronavirus and you have any of those common symptoms. Dr Paul Molloy said limited testing means it is dficult to tell how many people have COVID- and therefore how many have actually died of COVID-. He added that % of cases are mild and don’t make it as far as GPs or the hospital and % probably do with % severely affected. googletag.cmd.push Out of the % that make it to the COVID Centre probably  % of them are at present sent home again without being tested as only those admitted are tested, he said. That means that doctors are potentially only testing a very small proportion of those actually affected. He did caveat the statement by saying he is a GP and not a statistician or an epidemiologist. “The dficulty is that many people in the community have other illnesses like COPD, heart disease etc,” he explained. “It is very possible thatthese people acquired COVID- it would be too much for them to cope with and they’d die at home. This would be similar to people dying of influenza. “It’ll not be recorded on their death certicate but it may have been the final illness that just was too much to cope with and been the precipitating factor for death. If these people die at home from COVID- it will be unknown as at present we are only testing those who are admitted to hospital. “All the people who are in the community with a flu do not knowit is coronavirus or another virus. “We have no idea therefore of the real numbers of patients affected or even the real number of deaths.” UNDER-REPORTING While this isn’t important in managing the illness, he says, it does become important when a discussion takes place about moving out of the current lockdown. “We know that about % of the population have to be infected before we develop herd immunity. “This was the original path the government set out on. “It’s also important that when restrictions are lted we can employ similar means to the countries who have been most successful in controlling this. “That is quickly identying pockets of virus in the community, isolating those pockets, tracing and testing any contacts and avoiding indiscriminate spread. “There are many, many people, % of those with COVID  out there who will only get mild symptoms. We are not testing them so we are only finding out whether people have COVID  or not, in a small group of people.” He added: “There is potentially as much as % under identication of actual cases then approximately and under-reported death rates for the same reason.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There are , miles between Garvagh and the city of Chandigarh in the Indore district of Madhya Pradesh in India, but for Jimmy McGilligan, distance was trivial. Jimmy’s acceptance of the Baha’i faith in  marked the beginning of an extraordinary journey that would culminate in a visit to Windsor Castle to receive an OBE in . A former boy scout, who helped his father on the farm, Jimmy received pound compensation after losing a toe in an agricultural accident aged just . He used the money wisely, buying a digger and beginning to build up his business from scratch, while also maintaining an amateur radio station from his home between  and . googletag.cmd.push Gradually, he become frustrated with the wastage he encountered through his profession, often expressing disappointment at seeing milk dumped into the sea and the beef farming surplus.  “He was very passionate about the environment,” says we Janak, who still lives in the couple’s home, a self-sustaining farm in a mountainous region of central India. “He used to lead walks as part of the Ulster Rambling Club and he also was very proud to have a radio license and built his own radio station. “He was in the Orange Order - they used to call him the first Orange man who accepted Baha’i faith!” googletag.cmd.push After volunteering in a Baha’i centre in Haa, it was felt that Jimmy’s skills could be put to work where and he was invited to volunteer in Madhya Pradesh, India. It was there that a chance encounter brought him into contact with his future we. “Jimmy was asked to reclaim  acres of land for a residential school for rural boys near Gwalior. It had marshy lands and it needed his skills,” says Janak. “I was on my way from Delhi to Indore and I had no vehicle of my own. I had been working for three years, starting an institute for rural girls from a piece of barren land. “The Australian High Commission donated a jeep and I had a driver who wanted to see this school that was on our way to Indore. “We stopped there for a while and I told the principal of the school that I only had a short while, but he said he had a volunteer that wanted to see my institute. “I looked at my watch and told him I only had  minutes, butyour volunteer wants to come, we can take him with us. “That volunteer was Jimmy. Twenty-five minutes later, he was in our jeep and we brought him home.” SPACE AT A PREMIUM  If Jimmy was expecting the comforts of his County Derry home, he was in for a rude awakening as, with the institute in its infancy, accommodation was at a premium. “I had no space at that time,” says Janak. “I couldn’t give him an apartment or a room, but there was a small room where we used to keep the girls’ mattresses during the day. “When the  or so mattresses were taken out, Jimmy could sleep – and it was not a soft bed! “I didn’t know anything about the people in Northern Ireland. There was no toilet, he had to walk to the outhouse. There was no flushing system and you had to pour a can of water in.” Jimmy’s work ethic was insatiable. He set about preparing six acres of land, armed with little more than a Swiss Army kne from his keen interest in mountaineering. The Garvagh man was more used to working with heavy machinery, but after navigating the more primitive pick and spade and settling into his work, he had a suggestion for Janak. “We had three visitors arrive to see the institute one day,” she smiles. “Jimmy was talking to them and said it was such important work that he could spend all his le there. This was his proposal. “I said he was welcome, but his visa was ending soon. An elderly Baha’i man, who was sitting close by and who was very fatherly to us, then spoke. “He looked at me and he told Jimmy: This is your visa. The three girls started talking to me and they were encouraging me to talk to him about this.” The couple agreedJimmy was granted a visa to remain in India, they would discuss getting married and they travelled together to Delhi to meet the authorities. LUCK  With the country’s laws permitting only foreign women to remain in India after marrying Indian men, and not the other way around, Jimmy and Janak needed a stroke of luck. “When they found out I was the only person in central India working in a programme with funding from the Ministry of Science and Technology, he said they couldn’t afford to let me go. “They made an exception – he said to go and get married and they would sort out the visa.” Now engaged, the couple headed straight for Janak’s family home in Chandigarh. With no phones or internet, the news had to be delivered in person. “We had no other way of communicating,” laughs Janak. “We just arrived home on an ordinary bus at midnight. My mother opened the door to us and was shocked, but very happy with the news. “She was always complaining I was not going to get married. My four brothers and sisters were married with children and I always said I would never get married - Jimmy used to say that too. “It was the middle of the night, so she ran to where my father was sleeping, pulled back the blanket and said: ‘Get up, your daughter is here with this boy and she wants to get married!’. “My father just asked Jimmy one question. He askedJimmy was a Baha’i and when Jimmy said he was, my father said: ‘God bless you, only a Baha’i could keep my daughter happy.” The pair exchanged rings the next evening and on November , , less than a month after first meeting, Jimmy and Janak were married.  After a brief honeymoon in the mountains, they ed to work at the institute, and a few months later, with Jimmy now installed as manager, the couple visited his home country. “Everyone was constantly talking about the weather,” recalls Janak. “They kept telling me I had brought Indian weather, no one was asking about my mother or father. In India, we ask about everything. “I got into that rhythm eventually. The next morning my father in law asked me how I was doing, so I said it was a lovely day.” Janak fell in love with Northern Ireland, but as Baha’i pioneers, both her and Jimmy ed to their responsibilities at the Barli Institute, where the Garvagh man was adored by the students. “Jimmy picked up all the Hindi in female speech because he learned it from the girls,” says Janak. “These girls came from an area where they were treated as ‘untouchables’, almost equal to slaves in the past. “Jimmy would work with them - not like a boss, but as a father or elderly brother. He was very kind to the girls.” Janak suffered a health scare in  when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and Jimmy, who had seen his mother die from the same disease, was deeply worried. After surgery, Janak thankfully made a full recovery and the couple added celebration to relief when Jimmy received acclaim for his years of sterling work in India.  “In , the lady from British Deputy High Commission appointed him as a warden of British citizens in Indore and she nominated his name for OBE,” beams Janak. “He was conferred OBE in  after I had recovered from cancer. We both travelled and I had the privilege of going with him to Windsor Castle to receive the award. “It brought a lot of joy to all of our families and friends and was a huge recognition for him. After my recovery and this award, we made the decision to hand the institute over to our successors.” Janak and Jimmy set about making plans to retire and began training up another couple to take on the institute, but they were far from idle. The couple built a beautul house on a piece of farmland in Sanawadiya. The people of the village were living in darkness, so Jimmy built a solar and wind power station on site for them. Retirement was planned for April , , but tragedy struck just days before they were due to hand the institute over. Janak and Jimmy were travelling in a taxi when it was involved in a car accident on April  and Jimmy succumbed to fatal internal injuries on April . While admitting to feeling ‘completely lost’ without Jimmy, Janak is determined to honour his memory at their home. “I still run the solar and wind power station and call it the Jimmy McGilligan Centre for Sustainable Development. We train people here free of charge in sustainable technology. “It was a small, rocky place but now there are maybe  trees and we grow everything that we eat here. “There is a Baha’i saying that suits Jimmy and I well – humanity is a bird with two wings. The bird can only fly when both wings support each other. Jimmy and I were a really good bird.” Jimmy McGilligan would have celebrated his thbirthday last week, a man from humble beginnings whose dedication and integrity ensured he soared to a great height.

My four brothers and sisters were married with children and I always said I would never get married - Jimmy used to say that too. “It was the middle of the night, so she ran to where my father was sleeping, pulled back the blanket and said: ‘Get up, your daughter is here with this boy and she wants to get married!’. “My father just asked Jimmy one question. He askedJimmy was a Baha’i and when Jimmy said he was, my father said: ‘God bless you, only a Baha’i could keep my daughter happy.” The pair exchanged rings the next evening and on November , , less than a month after first meeting, Jimmy and Janak were married.  After a brief honeymoon in the mountains, they ed to work at the institute, and a few months later, with Jimmy now installed as manager, the couple visited his home country. “Everyone was constantly talking about the weather,” recalls Janak. “They kept telling me I had brought Indian weather, no one was asking about my mother or father. In India, we ask about everything. “I got into that rhythm eventually. The next morning my father in law asked me how I was doing, so I said it was a lovely day.” Janak fell in love with Northern Ireland, but as Baha’i pioneers, both her and Jimmy ed to their responsibilities at the Barli Institute, where the Garvagh man was adored by the students. “Jimmy picked up all the Hindi in female speech because he learned it from the girls,” says Janak. “These girls came from an area where they were treated as ‘untouchables’, almost equal to slaves in the past. “Jimmy would work with them - not like a boss, but as a father or elderly brother. He was very kind to the girls.” Janak suffered a health scare in  when she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and Jimmy, who had seen his mother die from the same disease, was deeply worried. After surgery, Janak thankfully made a full recovery and the couple added celebration to relief when Jimmy received acclaim for his years of sterling work in India.  “In , the lady from British Deputy High Commission appointed him as a warden of British citizens in Indore and she nominated his name for OBE,” beams Janak. “He was conferred OBE in  after I had recovered from cancer. We both travelled and I had the privilege of going with him to Windsor Castle to receive the award. “It brought a lot of joy to all of our families and friends and was a huge recognition for him. After my recovery and this award, we made the decision to hand the institute over to our successors.” Janak and Jimmy set about making plans to retire and began training up another couple to take on the institute, but they were far from idle. The couple built a beautul house on a piece of farmland in Sanawadiya. The people of the village were living in darkness, so Jimmy built a solar and wind power station on site for them. Retirement was planned for April , , but tragedy struck just days before they were due to hand the institute over. Janak and Jimmy were travelling in a taxi when it was involved in a car accident on April  and Jimmy succumbed to fatal internal injuries on April . While admitting to feeling ‘completely lost’ without Jimmy, Janak is determined to honour his memory at their home. “I still run the solar and wind power station and call it the Jimmy McGilligan Centre for Sustainable Development. We train people here free of charge in sustainable technology. “It was a small, rocky place but now there are maybe  trees and we grow everything that we eat here. “There is a Baha’i saying that suits Jimmy and I well – humanity is a bird with two wings. The bird can only fly when both wings support each other. Jimmy and I were a really good bird.” Jimmy McGilligan would have celebrated his thbirthday last week, a man from humble beginnings whose dedication and integrity ensured he soared to a great height.

To be honest though, it’s easy. Derry is, in fact, unique because there isn’t another club championship in Ireland that has hosted Enda Muldoon or Patsy Bradley. And when I saw that I’ve compiled a club All-Star team without Conleth Gilligan or Shane McGuigan or Benny Heron or Emmett McGuckin, I thought two things. One, I hate myself. And two, Derry club football is special. . Eoin Mailey After  seasons playing senior football with Ardmore, Eoin Mailey has always stood out as a man who could cut it at any level. It would be an insult to a goalkeeper of such calibre and experience for me to list out the qualities that made him a top class number one. Just know he has them all. googletag.cmd.push h. Oisiacuten Duffy At St. Columb’s College, Oisiacuten was a dogged defender who’d stick to his man and guarantee you that no forward being shadowed by him would enjoy his day. In the space of a couple of years, he went from being a brilliant corner back to a dominant central player, so inspiring and so important in defence and attack. . Brendan Rogers When was the last time a full back caused the opposition such panic and headaches in the build-up to big games  Brendan Rogers has shut down the best forwards in the country but he has also been one of Slaughtneil’s most valuable players in transition. When he pumps the afterburners, it’s like he’s gliding up pitch on a moped. googletag.cmd.push . Gareth McKinless McKinless is nearly sadistic with the pleasure he derives from crushing the best laid plans of an enthusiastic attacker. As far back as  when he was switched on to Michael Murphy in Omagh, he’s been an irreplaceable hammer in the Ballinderry arsenal, used wherever they’ve needed him to bring the pain. . Jimmy O’Connor When I was younger, I had this idea in my head that top football players without exception had to be six feet tall and weighing  stone. Then I got roasted by Jimmy O’Connor. And for over a decade, I’ve seen him terrorise junior and intermediate teams from wing back – and he was doing it before wing backs were supposed to. . Chrissy McKaigue Tireless, supremely intelligent and, most importantly, uncompromising. Slaughtneil took their championship tally from one to five in four years, winning three Ulster titles and winning the adoration of everyone in the nation. Chrissy McKaigue was the face of that revolution and he was the beating heart of it too. . Paul Cartin Legend has it that, on a calm and clear day on the River Foyle, you can still hear the faint echo of the whelps that followed Paul Cartin’s shoulder tackle on Joe Diver in the quarter-final in Celtic Park in . Banagher’s daring dreams might’ve been futile in the end, but stories will be told about Paul Cartin long after we forget who won and lost. . Patsy Bradley Remember Mary K Burke’s photo of Patsy Bradley flying horizontally above Ballinderry heads through the air to get a finger nail on the ball  Take that action, multiply it by  minutes and multiply that by  years and you’re not even close to Patsy Bradley yet. Heart, hands, hardcore athleticism. The best ball-winner, in the air and in defence. . Enda Muldoon For all the big moments, Enda Muldoon was orchestrating them. It was his back-spinned pass to Raymie Wilkinson that finally undid Banagher in . It was his telepathic diagonal ball for Collie Devlin that broke Slaughtneil. It was Muldoon in the sky, it was Muldoon taking hits to free others, it was even Muldoon at  controlling the play. It was always Muldoon. . Niall McNicholl Captained Castledawson to their first ever championship title in  and led them with utter distinction on their road to a another two. A player who always managed to find time on the ball and a player who always managed to get on the ball even with all the work he subjected himself to. . Chrissy Bradley They’re still researching how a man with so many target dots on his head can still find so much space and freedom. You don’t win four championships in succession without top class forwards and, as a scorer and as a playmaker, Sammy Bradley has been one of the best throughout Slaughtneil’s rise. . Sean Leo McGoldrick Sean Leo McGoldrick is just better than you or I at football. It’s just easy for him. Imagine how you see the game, on and off the ball, Sean Leo sees that same game in at least  per cent slower motion. He’s been unfalteringly exceptional for Eoghan Rua – as he was for Derry. . Lee Moore Lee Moore is one tough football player. He’s not a Fancy Dan corner forward who needs sunshine and hard ground to excel. He can win dirty ball , he can hold his own and no matter the day he’ll still be one of the most lethally accurate kickers of a ball you’ll see. . Colm McGoldrick I think I’ve played against Colm McGoldrick four times and, no exaggeration, I have never laid a hand on him. I’ve tried to tackle him, loads of times, but failed at every chance to even touch him. It’s freakish how powerful he is yet so evasive at the same time. The football he’s played for Eoghan Rua was at a standard that would’ve ripped inter-county defenders apart. . Eoin Bradley Throughout the first half of the decade, Eoin Bradley was showing in so many dferent games that he was one of the finest footballers in the land. Glenullin might not have enjoyed much success in that time but Bradley was unmarkable – at ,  or . It was carnage what he was doing to teams and almost poetic that he was fighting losing battles despite taking scalps all around him.

Seonaidh Mullan, who played camogie and ladies’ football for Ballerin, ran a STEM cell registration event following her diagnosis to encourage people to register as donors. The event, hosted at the GAA club in Ballerin, resulted in over  donors registering as potential lesavers. Camogie club Chairperson Melinda Robinson said many in the community were grieving the loss of a friend. “Seonaidh was an extremely private person, very modest. There was no fuss with her. She was the first at training and the last to go home. googletag.cmd.push “When we had younger players coming on the team who maybe faced dferent things in le, she was the one those girls felt confident in sharing a story with. “If they were having a bad evening, she was the girl they went to. The girls thought very highly of her. Seonaidh was steeped in the le of her GAA club. She was always on the starting , and her experience on the hockey pitch brought a fierceness to her tackling on the camogie pitch. Even on the warmest days, she would train in the black Ballerin waterproof jacket and bandana, socks to her knees, urging her teammates to ‘come on and be serious’. googletag.cmd.push Her words on the pitch were always of positive encouragement, but she wasn’t afraid to voice her opinion to the refereeshe disagreed with the decision. With coronavirus regulations limiting funerals to immediate family only, the club have taken the innovative step of creating a virtual guard of honour. Club members sent pictures of themselves in Seonaidh’s beloved red and white Ballerin colours in order to pay their respects. Seonaidh is survived by her husband Stephen, her son Oisiacuten and daughter Una and the wider Black and Mullan families. “People see Seonaidh’s picture on social media or the paper and see the mother, the camoacuteg, the woman who left behind a legacy for STEM cell recruitment. She was all of those things,” said Melinda. “But strip all that away and Seonaidh was our friend, a friend we’ve lost, a voice we won’t hear again, a smiling face we won’t see.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Tomorrow marks the first anniversary of the death of the -year-old journalist in Creggan last April. Detectives from the PSNI’s Major Investigation Team investigating the murder of Lyra have issued an appeal ahead of the anniversary. The Senior Investigating Officer has sent letters to people living in Creggan directly appealing to them to think back to the tragic events of a year ago and bring any new information forward to police. Detective Superintendent Jason Murphy, who is leading the investigation, said: “On Saturday,  months will have passed since journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead during rioting at Fanad Drive in Creggan. googletag.cmd.push Sadly Lyra’s mum died very recently without seeing justice for her daughter. While this appeal for information is being distributed by the police, it is also a direct appeal from the McKee family for help in getting justice for Lyra. “The community as a whole was devastated by Lyra’s murder. Condemnation of her killing was unequivocal. That condemnation brought support for the community’s response from countries across the world.” In his letter sent to Creggan residents, Detective Superintendent Murphy said: “Since Lyra was killed, many of you may have spoken with my team of detectives. We have strived to conduct the investigation with sensitivity and care. My investigation is being carried out with the community and this has enabled us to gather important evidence which has resulted in one man being charged with Lyra’s murder and a second man being charged with offences connected to the rioting which preceded it. googletag.cmd.push “My sincere thanks go to all those who have helped to date. “However, these charges do not signy the end of the investigation. For the police service, me and my team of detectives it is only the beginning. A huge amount of work has been done and massive amounts of community help has enabled us to piece together the events of  April  and gain a clear understanding of the roles played by those who were involved. “Lyra’s murder was not committed in isolation, nor did it involve only one person. The events that led up to Lyra being shot, and the events afterwards, are equally important. I am asking the community to reach into its conscience and tell us what it knows. Lyra’s family cannot begin the grieving process without the information about Lyra’s murder that they deserve. Anybody in their position would want the same. “One year on, I am still seeking the evidence to bring every single person who was involved that night to justice. I cannot deliver that without you. Specically I want to: Gather mobile phone footage or photographs from anyone who was there that nightSpeak to anyone who was present and who can identy those involved in the disorderSpeak to anyone who can provide first-hand evidence relating to the events which preceded or followed Lyra’s murderRecover the gun that killed Lyra“We have made the public portal available again, so that you can contact us discreetly. Log ontohttps:mipp.police.ukfrom your mobile, tablet, laptop or other device. We do not need to keep your mobile phone or device – we are only interested in downloading the videos or images of that night. Please tell us what you know. If you want to speak to me directly, let me know via the MIPP application, email me atjason.murphy@psni.pnn.police.ukor ring me via . “The community response has been incredible so far, but I know that other information and material is out there. On Lyra’s first anniversary I want to re-state the commitment of the police service to work with you as we collectively seek to release communities from the influence of terrorists. “For the purposes of this investigation, I will offer anonymity to those who wish to talk to us. All I am looking for is a conversation. That’s it. I know that iniduals may be struggling with their conscience, either about footage they have or information they know. We can help with that. Talk to us. Ease your conscience and help us resolve a small part of the nightmare that the McKee family live through every single day.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Emergency food parcels and hot meals are also being distributed by local groups. googletag.cmd.push Donna Matthewson, Apex Director of Housing, said they were delighted with how the initiative was operating. “Over the last number of years we have developed an excellent relationship with Fareshare, delivering fresh food to eleven local charities on an on-going basis,” she said. “Recently we have seen the impact Covid- has had on families in this city and this new service with Fareshare has been established as a result. “We are delighted to be able to assist in redirecting these vital food supplies to those who need them most. “Feedback from community groups has been fantastic and we hope to continue this service for the duration of the pandemic.” googletag.cmd.push Ciara Ferguson from Greater Shantallow Area Partnership praised the food delivery scheme. “This service has allowed us to provide much needed food parcels for those who have negatively impacted by the Covid- crisis. “The food is of great quality and iety and the extra help means the world to our local families whose incomes have been reduced as a result of the pandemic.” If you or someone you know is struggling to afford or access food during the Covid- pandemic, contact your local DEA partnership office:Outer North-   Outer West-   Triax-   Waterside-     If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I liked the balance of having the occasional day at home and the rest of the week in the office.ldquoI think the boys are definitely happy at having mummy home all the time and we all are enjoying that but they miss their school friends.

I believe it is important to openly acknowledge that many of us, as nurses and midwives, are frightened and uncertain regarding the impending challenges presented by the COVID- pandemic.ldquoIn order to meet these challenges, as professionals we will need to adopt a flexible approach. This includes asking staff to work in unfamiliar settings, in dferent clinical roles or undertake a task focussed approach to provision of care.

This is the first time this has happened since the foot and mouth outbreak in .There is a possibility of point-to-point bumpers on racecourses when jump racing s and also an expanded autumn season.The national hunt season has ended which means no Irish Grand National on Easter Monday and no Punchestown Festival mdash Irelandrsquos Cheltenham mdash at the end of the month.Gordon Elliott, who had two winners at the recent Downpatrick meeting and who had  horses in training, is now down to , so he has had to cut back on staff.The end of the point-to-point season is a severe blow to local trainers like Paddy Turley, Stuart Crawford, Colin McKeever and Warren Ewing, who produce young horses to sell after running them in four year-old races.I understand that Co Wexford trainer Donnchadh Doyle had  four year-olds ready to make their debuts and there are a lot more trainers in the same boat.When racing resumes it will be all flat racing for a month, so with Downpatrick now only running jump racing it will be some time until locals get back to their favourite venue.With the English jump season also curtailed it is good to know that Newtownhamilton native Brian Hughes, who rode his first ever winner as a flat apprentice for his boss Kevin Prendergast at Downpatrick, has been crownedchampion jockey for the first time, with a total of  wins,  clear of reigning champion Richard Johnston.Sadly this weekrsquos news has seen thousands of horses taken out of training.With the English national hunt season coming to a close earlier than originally planned, itrsquos well done to Ballee native David Maxwell on riding a total of  winners from a total of only  rides. He rides all his own horses.It was also a very good season for another Downpatrick rider, Danny McMenamin, who is attached to the yard of Nicky Richards, for whom Tony Dobbin was stable jockey for many years.Danny, who gets plenty of rides for other yards, rode a fantastic  winners from  rides. He also rode many to finish either second or third during the season.The original fixture list for  is now null and void so the original dates for Downpatrick and Down Royal, when we hopefully get back to normal sooner than later, will be all change to those originally sent out to members.An interesting fact that I learned with interest at the weekend was that Willie Robinson, who rode Laffy to win the  Ulster National at Downpatrick for the Queen Mother, was retained by Major John Corbett of Tyrella to ride for him.This was in the s before he moved to England as stable jockey to Fulke Walwyn. O course Laffy was stabled at Major Corbettrsquos establishment prior to running in the Ulster National, being trained in England by Peter Cazalet.With no racing in Ireland or England at the present time, it is a good chance to do some reading and a book just recently published, The Story of Dundalk Stadium, is a must for local racing fans.As most people know Dundalk mdash always thought about as the third local track, despite being in Co Louth mdash holds some great memories for locals, too many to record here.A feature by Frankie Fitzsimons is most interesting and he recalls the day that his father and namesake, brother Brian and himself, all rose in the famous Sweet Afton Hunters Chase back in .Frankie senior finished fth on Royal Knight, now owned by Tom Kerr from Ballygowan, while Brian rode Satin Link, also owned by Kerr, whose colours were red with the initials THK on them. Frankie finished third on Bright Cottage in the colours of Brightrsquos Arnold Ennis, who at that stage was a farmer but later turned his farm into a popular golf club.The book records that Frankie senior won the Sweet Afton in  on Fort Wayne, trained by Major John Corbett at Tyrella. He also rode Copper Cottage, trained beside Downpatrick Racecourse by Ned Altern in . He also won the race in  on Copper Ridge, like Copper Cottage owned by Major T W Hughes, this one also trained by Ned Altern. This race was won in  by Frigid Fox, owned by S J Martin from Ballynahinch and ridden by his son Raymond.In later years this race became known as the Tallanstown Hunters Chase and was won by Bald Joker in the colours of Christine McBratney and ridden by her brother-in-law Colin, now a trainer at Crossgar.Frankie Fitzsimons junior rode a few winners under rules, but the one that he will always recall was when he rode Palo to victory in the opening hurdle race of the day at Dundalk in , the horse being owned by the well known busy draper, Downpatrickrsquos Joe Rea, and trained by Peter McGreevy.Back in  owner trainer Tom McConnell, from Carsonstown, near Saintfield, and Darragh Cross amateur Barney Jones recorded their first ever success when successful with loving star in the bumper race.Barney told me recently that on their way that day they collected a lot of bets to place on the horse and as his mouth got dry when he rode he was sucking a sweet that stuck to the roof of his mouth at the start.In  Farranfad farmer and horse breeder Brian Kennedy pulled off a   shock when he saddled Star of Venosos in his green and white belt colours to win the valuable CarrollHandicap Hurdle under Harry Rodgers, now a trainer.This was Brianrsquos first ever success as a trainer and although he only held a licence for a short time he also saddled his charge to win the Ulster Cesarewitch at   at Downpatrick when,memory serves me correctly, it was ridden by Ards jockey Philip Lowry.Lots of other names like Miss K R Payne, Leslie Crawford, Willie Rooney, Jeremy Maxwell, Sammy Shields, Robin Kidd and Pat McAteer feature in the book that brings back some great memories of a popular course, no longer the same to some of us..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Recognition.jpg","title":"Recognition for poet Stephen  ","story":"A BALLYGOWAN poet is celebrating after his debut anthology was recognised by two major awarding bodies.Stephen Sextonrsquos If All the World and Love Were Young was awarded the highly acclaimed American E M Forester Award which was previously won by Seamus Heaney in .His anthology, published by Penguin Books, was also shortlisted for this yearrsquos Shine Strong Award ndash an award presented annually to the author of the best first collection of poems published by an Irish poet.Stephen says his work centres on coming to terms with the death of his mother, Elizabeth, who passed away in .He said: ldquoI started writing a book of poems that initially were meant to be frivolous and entertaining.ldquoHowever, as I began writing, the intense grief I was battling at the time came to the fore.Critics say what developed was a touching tribute to his mother which they described as a moving narrative exploring bereavement, family le, memories and loss.The judging  consisted of poets Colum McCann, Jhumpa Lahiri and Paul Muldoon.As part of his prize fund for winning the highly acclaimed award, Stephen received , to travel and stay in the United States.Downpatrick poet Damian Smyth, head of literature at the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, congratulated Stephen on his award.He said: ldquoThe sense is quickly growing on both sides of the Atlantic that Stephen Sexton is already one of those rare poets whose obvious and prodigious lyrical gts are matched both by accessibility and universality.He added: ldquoIt is poignant that the person for whom the whole book is an elegy ndash his late mother mdashnever lived to see the acclaim lavished on her son.ldquoHowever, there are few contemporary works which describe the human processes of grief, loss, hurt and how love survives and endures as memorably and as movingly as this one, with virtuoso technique and profound wisdom, which I have to say is already a classic.

Itrsquos a service he says he and his staff have been proud to offer.He has pupils whose parents are key NHS medics, including a couple who are both respiratory consultants, and knows the need to provide a place of shelter and safety for children of key workers is critical.ldquoEvenI had to keep the school open for one child of an NHS worker, it would be worth it, he said. ldquoMy head has said lsquoshut the schoolrsquo like the rest of them, but my heart says we are in this together and wersquove got to do our part.ldquoHowever, Irsquom not condemning any school who has closed as they have probably done so for the best of reasons.ldquoI sat in tears on Sunday evening as I didnrsquot know what I was doing was right in keeping the school open or not. We are one of the few schools offering cover for the weekends and all over Easter. Not one of my staff refused to come in to take a turn to keep the school open.ldquoIrsquove had  or more people offering to come in and help. Irsquove a great staff and they all pull together. At the end of the day, we have done our very best to safeguard the children and staff.Thankfully, Mr Moore has not received any reports of coronavirus amongst his pupils and staff, and he hopes that this status will continue.Known for not taking himself too seriously, Mr Moore has been entertaining and educating his pupils with hilarious Facebook videos of himself as educator turned entertainer. Using his considerable wit and cuddly toys as pretend schoolchildren, the principal of  years has taught mathematics, the importance of punctuation and much more over the last few weeks.He describes the incoming principal, Mr Fegan, as ldquoalmost like a son to me, and is equally proud of his other two former vice-principals, Mr Niall Stevenson and Mrs Lorna Stitt , who left the school to become principals of Downpatrick Primary School and Portavogie Primary School respectively.Mr Moore taught in primary schools in Belfast and Lisburn after he qualying in . He came to Academy as vice-principal in September  and taught a composite P-P class.He took over as principal from Mr George Smyth just five years later.

Irsquom delighted with how my vice principals have gone on in their careers and that Mr Fegan has now been confirmed as the incoming principal after first coming here as a student teacher.ldquoIrsquove taken as much pleasure at seeing how some of my former pupils have fared in their careers and le as much as our AQE results, which are excellent. The school has also had three outstanding inspection reports in my time and apart from perhaps three rooms, the school has been completely refurbished.ldquoThe children are great ambassadors and a lot of them go on to to Down High School or Saintfield High School or Belfast grammar schools and quite often end up as head boy or head girl.His official send-off mdash a special assembly with an eveningat Temple Golf Club on June  mdash has been postponed.ldquoPersonally, itrsquos not ideal but there are people losing their lives, incomes, jobs, business are crashing, doctors and nurses putting their lives on the line, I will come back at a later stage and there will be a chance for everyone to say goodbye,said Mr Moore.ldquoTo be honest, Irsquom more upset for the Ps as most of them have been with us for eight years. Wersquove had to cancel going to Edinburgh, their leaving show which was going to be The Lion King in my honour.He said that his greatest delight at the school has been his pupils.ldquoThey are the main reason for my y tenure. It has been a joy to be their principal, he added.ldquoIt has also been an honour to have worked alongside the board of governors, both past and present, who have shared my vision for the school and supported me in its realisation.ldquoI am indebted in particular to the late Rev Alan Delamere, Mr David Donnan, Mr Geoffrey Perrin and currently Mr Peter Shaw for their leadership at the helm.ldquoThe current members of our teaching and non-teaching staff continue to reflect the professional dedication and loving care of their predecessors.

He was also brave and daring. He now attempted to conquer all of Ulster, which King Henry II had granted to him five years before. He gathered around him about  knights and archers, who, with their attendants, made up about one thousand men.Downpatrick was the capital of the Gaelic Kingdom of Ulidia. But de Courcyrsquos men were half starved when they reached the town they stole everything that they could lay their hands upon ndash they ate and drank, plundered and killed, until half of Downpatrick was in ruin.Almost at once the Gaelic king, Mac Dunleavy, came with a large force to attack de Courcy. He went out to meet Mac Dunleavy, and chose a strategic place to make an attack. The Gaels rushed in with great bravery, but they were unable to break the ranks of the Normans and after a fierce fight they were repulsed with great loss.But the Ulidians put up a most determined resistance. The valiant de Courcy attacked the Gaels as many as three times that year. De Courcy then suffered a number of reverses, so that it was an effort to hold his ground.He was defeated near Newry with the loss of  men and was intercepted in one of his many raids by the Dalaradian king, Cumee OrsquoFlynn. He escaped from the battlefield with only eleven companions and having lost their horses they fled on foot for two days and two nights, closely pursued, without food or sleep.But in other battles de Courcy was victorious, so that as the year passed his position in Ulster was strengthened. Now he started to build Dundrum Castle, along with Carrickfergus at a later date. The failure of local government in Down, now prompted King Henry II to make de Courcy the justiciar mdash or viceroy mdash in Ireland. During this time Connaught was invaded, de Courcy burning and slaying after his usual fashion.He was confronted by two kings from Munster and Thomond, who had united armies. Not venturing to make battle, he retreated northwards to save himself and his forces from destruction. He arrived in Ballysadare on the Sligo coast, with the enemy pursuing closely behind. He set fire to the buildings and fled south east.As he was crossing the Curlew Hills de Courcy was overtaken by the Gaels, who fell upon his men and killed a greater number of them. It was with dficulty that he escaped to Leinster with what remained of his army.De Courcy had enemies at court, chief among them being Hugh de Lacy, who poisoned King Johnrsquos mind against him. He was proclaimed a rebel and a traitor. De Lacy, now Lord Justice, was sent to arrest him.After a number of unsuccessful attempts de Courcy was atbetrayed by some of his own servants who led him to his retreat at Downpatrick, where he was taken in . His enemies came down upon him on Good Friday when he was barefooted and unarmed, doing penance in Down Cathedral. He snatched the nearest weapon, a great wooden cross, with which he dashed out the brains of many of his attackers before he was overpowered.Between his arrival at Downpatrick in  and his expulsion in  de Courcy founded many religious establishments, built abbeys for the Benedictines and the Cistercians and the great fortress of Dundrum Castle, then known as Rath.He had chosen a good site on a -foot high hill overlooking an inlet in Dundrum Bay in the plains of Lecale and the pass between the Mourne Mountains and the foothills of Slieve Croob.It is not known when the main keep was built, but it was a remarkable achievement in military science and architecture by the knights who had come back from the Holy Land on crusade. The diameter of the keep is  feet, and it is  feet high.But as a result of trouble in Downpatrick, de Courcy lost control of Dundrum Castle along with Carrickfergus Castle in Co Antrim. In the year after his expulsion de Courcy tried to recapture Dundrum Castle, now held by his father-in-law, the King of the Isle of Man. De Courcyrsquos attempts ended in failure and the castle became crown property. In  it was visited by King John.Dundrum Castle consisted of two storeys with wooden floors above the basement, and the original entrance on the ground floor. Chambers and passages were constructed along with a staircase rising to the walk wall.For over two centuries from  the history of the castle is barely documented. It appears that the Magennises seized Dundrum sometime in the th century and held it intermittently until it was surrendered to the Crown by Phelim Magennis in . The Savages appear to have been the owners when the Earl of Kildare took it in .The castle was granted to Lord Cromwell in , then sold in  by his grandson, the first earl of Ardglass, to Sir Francis Blundell.During the rising of  the Magennises retrieved the castle, but it was recaptured by the Parliamentarians, who partly demolished it in . By  the castle and grounds were placed into state care.Perhaps more than anywhere  in Ireland, Dundrum reflects the Anglo-Irish spirit ndash the work of the great de Courcy, the soldier-knight adventurer. Today Dundrum Castle is a ruin. De Courcyrsquos other achievement in Ulster, Carrickfergus Castle, is the best preserved Norman castle in Ireland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th April 2020 When.jpg","title":"When Stirling Moss came to Downpatrick  ","story":"A RETIRED Downpatrick motor dealer has expressed his ldquotremendous sadness at the death of Sir Stirling Moss at the weekend.The motor racing legend, who was , was the guest of honour at the opening of Mr Billy McCormickrsquos refurbished Black and White garage in .It was a major event in the town and there were hundreds of people outside the newly renovated premises in Church Street, all eager to get a glimpse of one of the worldrsquos top sports stars.Mr McCormick has fond memories of the occasion. ldquoIt was a big day in every sense.

She is currently putting our exhausted son to bed. I step into the back garden to drink in the last drops of warm air before the nighttime chill descends.My thoughts turn, as they usually do around this time of the week, to what I will write about in my column.I sit there for some time, my mind barren.No sound, just colour in the garden \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...I look around, trying to take the perspective outside of my own thoughts. There are colours in the garden - ochre, pale yellow, startling pink, and ying depths of green.I’m no gardener and I’m struck by how this cycle continues without any interference or direction from me. But, while some buds have sprouted already, others remain just a promise. Plants, like people, develop at their own pace.There is something even more erting than the wash of the leaves it is the sound. Or rather, the lack of it. The air is still tonight so there is no rustle from the tips of the trees. The birdsong has long since quietened.More, there is no low thunder of traffic from the nearby road, no distant rumble of a plane in the sky. There are no cries of children playing, no adults talking. There is no urgent rush of oil burners boiling.I have sat in the same spot on countless evenings before, but I’m not sure I’ve ever noticed this vacuum before. Is it always this way, or is this another manestation of our new condition The silence is, at the same time, both reassuring and disconcerting. I enjoy the peace, but still like to hear some activity, just to remind me that there is something  out there, on the other side of the garden fence. I crunch my feet on the loose stones, just to create a sound.I take a moment and consider the day just passed. I’m reluctantly forced to admit that it has been pleasant. I feel a certain guilt in this, knowing so much about how many are suffering at this time. But, undeniably, there is an degree of attraction in this slower pace of le.This was a family day. The three of us shared breakfast and dinner at the same table, played together, watched a film, went for a walk. I wore a sun hat. Our son talked a lot and we listened. Later, when my boy is dreaming, my we and I will watch something silly on TV. She will have a glass of wine while I munch crisps. There is nothing  to do.I have written a lot in previous weeks about the strain that lockdown has brought to me and others. While that is true, it is only honest to state that it is not the full picture. This adversity has also created a more profound appreciation and distinction of what is important in our lives, and what we can do without.I think about what I miss most of the old le. Being able to see extended family and friends, watching my son playing with those of his own age. Much beyond that now seems dispensable. My whole le has been lived aggrandising sport to appear more important than it should be. Now, I find, I don’t think much about it. The new reality has separated the substance from the garnish.I consider how a normal day off work, before the pandemic, would have looked. There would have been a panic to squeeze in many activities. We would have tried to take our son to a class or play date in the morning, fought our way around a supermarket or clothes shop, visited people, forced some small talk, perhaps gone out for dinner, all while I followed the progress of multiple sporting events on my phone and checked social media. It would have been typically frenzied.This frenzy is of mind as well as action. I can explain this best through a simple example. I enjoy drinking pure apple juice. Apple juice with other flavours added, I enjoy less. When I go to the shop I often set myself the task of buying the plain juice. Yet, more often than not, I get home to find I have bought apple juice flavoured with pear, elderflower or, worst of all, cucumber and mint.The problem is clear, it is a symptom of a cluttered mind. Forever anxious about the next thing that needs to be done, and the thing after that, and not focusing on what is in front of my eyes. Sometimes, it feels that I can only think with clarity when I write, it is the most effective way of finding a path through this troubled maze.It is hard to look past the current pandemic when the agony being suffered by many is absolute. As I said earlier, its claw is so long and pointed that I now feel a degree of guilt when I’m enjoying an experience that I know others cannot.But the crisis will pass and then some of the things that enrich and colour our lives will start up again. Perhaps we will be just as we were before, perhaps, because the trauma has the potential to improve us, we will be slightly altered. The upsurge in kindness and compassion which has become apparent throughout communities will hopefully prove more tenacious than the virus which spawned it.The air is cooler now and I’m surprised at how long I’ve been sitting in the same spot. It is harder to see the plants in the half-light but the night seems just as peaceful as what passed before. I enjoy it for a few more moments before I go back inside.One of the many effects of the lockdown has been to sharpen my senses towards what is around me. It has given me the chance to spend time with my we and son that I would otherwise have missed. Distractions have been removed as the regulations mean we have settled into a more sedate, purer set of habits.Tomorrow will be another family day.

Providing that people continue to be generous then there wonrsquot be a problem.As increasing numbers of people self-isolate to protect themselves from the virus, Claire said that the food bank was able to offer deliveriesnecessary.ldquoWe are a very open foodbank. If yoursquove got a need, just ask and we can do our best, said Claire.After the Church in Wales announced the suspension of public acts of worship, the Tabernacle and other churches in Penarth have been finding innovative ways to support their congregation.ldquoFrom this weekend we are going to be streaming virtual services, said Clair.ldquoOur musicians are recording pieces in their homes which will be shared online.ldquoAll our small groups meet on Zoom so wersquore in touch with our congregation.ldquoThe more elderly congregations are keeping in touch by phone and telephone to support them in every way ndash spiritually, emotionally and practically.ldquoThe epidemic is pulling everybody together and cutting across denominational boundaries.The Tabernacle Foodbank is open for donations and collections between am and pm Monday to Friday.You can also deliver donations to their collection point in Sainsburyrsquos on Windsor Road.The foodbank would particularly welcome tinned products, including curry, chilli, corned beef, and potatoes.For more information, visit: Info@tabspenarth or call:  . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
