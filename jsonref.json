We want everything, from relationships to families, to function in a warm lovely rosy glow, when life isn\u0027t not like that.           Some have questioned whether playing evil creeps has changed Hopkins\u0027 personalityFamilies are messy, full of liars and cheats and adulterers. The truth is, we are lonelier than ever, and have far fewer real friends that two decades ago.As for families - we are not connected by choice, but were born into them, and only blood ties us together. These days, people get married more than once, and have children with multiple partners. Sir Anthony Hopkins\u0027 daughter Abigail was born during his first marriage to Petronella Barker, one which didn\u0027t last very long. Abigail has consistently said he \u0027walked out on them\u0027 but in fact she and her father were speaking for a while, and he secured her small parts in two of her films. She changed her name to Harrison, presumably to try and start a career under her own steam, not hanging onto his coat tails.          If Abigail wanted to see her dad, she need only pick up the phone, write a letter or say helloHopkins has been very candid about his struggles with booze and his unsociable behaviour, and hasn\u0027t touched alcohol since 1975. He moved to the US with his second wife and his career really took off, but he still sounds like an extremely hard man to be around, let alone be related to. He disappeared from his American home without warning and moved into another house for months on end, leaving his wife behind, and later lived as a hippie in the desert for a couple of months. He says he\u0027s been diagnosed with Asperger\u0027s, which might explain the need for solitude and struggles with empathy.Abigail - his only daughter - had a breakdown whilst studying at University, so they might have more in common than is immediately apparent. Hopkins has been happilly married to his third wife since 2003, and still lives in the USA. His daughter is now in her late forties and based in the UK, and they are never in touch. Abigail is said to blame her father for leaving her mother all those years ago, but isn\u0027t it time to move on? Her father is a talented artist, a gifted actor and musician. Why not celebrate what he\u0027s good at, not moan on what he lacks? Empathy might not be his forte, but he is undoubtedly telling the truth in his latest interview - life is cold, life is tough. Why pretend otherwise?We shy away from stark language like this - when people die, we talking of \u0027passing\u0027. When we want to contact someone we gush drivel about \u0027reaching out\u0027 - I want to retch. Let\u0027s revert to plain speaking. If Abigail wanted to see her dad, she need only pick up the phone, write a letter or say hello.Sir Anthony is a proud old man who cannot be held responsible for what happened nearly half a century ago. I am sure he is self-centred, difficult, obsessive and a pain in the arse - but I\u0027d be happy to claim him as my dad.Meghan was criticised by some when it emerged that the only member of her family to be invited to the Royal wedding was her mother. She tried to include her dad - but he turned out to be a flake, although she remained loyal throughout the fiasco over whether he was coming or not and those ‘posed’ pap pictures. Her decision not to include her nephews was absolutely correct - the police visited their hotel room in London and confiscated a knife from Tyler (the cannabis grower) and an illegal pepper spray from his brother Thomas. The pair flew straight back to the USA after making an apology to the police - to avoid being arrested and charged.Meghan\u0027s decision to exclude her family was wise - luckily she has a mother who\u0027s a better role model than that tawdry bunch.Sir Anthony Hopkins isn\u0027t the only person whose life functions better without pretending every relative is a best buddy. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/10/4C9D17C200000578-0-image-m-10_1527240775310.jpg","title":"Sturgeon bids revive floundering Scottish independence campaign","story":"    Nicola Sturgeon (pictured yesterday in te Scottish Parliament) today tried to revive her floundering bid for Scottish independence by pleading with voters to see it as an escape from the \u0027despair of Brexit\u0027Nicola Sturgeon today tried to revive her floundering bid for Scottish independence by pleading with voters to see it as an escape from the \u0027despair of Brexit\u0027. The Scottish First Minister is publishing a new report on how independence would work today despite repeated setbacks at the ballot box as voters reject the idea.Ms Sturgeon insisted there was now a \u0027very different political and economic situation\u0027 to when the last referendum was held in 2014. Her report advocates keeping the pound during a transition period after an independence vote - before potentially moving to a new currency. She said: \u0027There is no status quo and we know that being taken out of Europe and out of a market around eight times bigger than the UK market alone will hit our economy.\u0027That is why it is time to begin a fresh debate and to replace the despair of Brexit with optimism about Scotland\u0027s future.\u0027We look forward to debating the report\u0027s recommendations - both within the SNP and with business, trade unions and communities across Scotland.\u0027 Corbyn admits he would NOT fight to keep Britain together in...Share this articleThe Sustainable Growth Commission was set up to look at the future economic prospects of Scotland.The 354-page report will outline that the pound should remain as Scotland\u0027s currency for a period of time after any break from the Union.There has been speculation the country would then move to a new Scottish version of Sterling.

With a turnout of 53 per cent which amounted to 1.2 million people, nearly 67 per cent voted Yes and over 33 per cent voted No.          Ireland held a referendum on the Eighth Amendment of the country’s constitution on May 25It read: ‘The state acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.’ This gave equal rights to the mother and the unborn, but did not ban abortion.However, in 1992 in what is referred to as Case X, a 14-year-old girl who fell pregnant after being raped claimed to be suicidal and therefore, a risk to her life and the unborn. She was stopped from travelling to Britain for an abortion and the case sparked debate across Ireland.Three separate referendums were held in November of the same year: the 12th Amendment attempted to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but this was defeated.However, the 13th and 14th Amendments, which meant that women could travel abroad to have terminations and be given information about this, were both passed and added to the constitution.Another referendum was held in 2002, which tried to remove suicide as grounds for abortion, but it was ultimately rejected with over 50 per cent voting No.However, in 2010, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Ireland was violating the European Convention of Human Rights because the rules surrounding what is and isn’t a legal abortion were blurred.          A woman lays flowers next to a mural of Savita Halappanavar in Dublin, as Ireland votes In addition to this, the case of Savita Halappanavar also sparked debate around Ireland and the world watched as the Galway dentist died following complications from a septic miscarriage, after she was denied an abortion.In 2013, the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act was passed which clearly defined what a legal abortion meant. These three scenarios were risk of loss of life from physical illness, risk of loss of life from physical illness in emergency and risk of loss of life from suicide.What is Repeal the 8th?On May 25 2018, Ireland has the opportunity to repeal the country’s abortion law and the Eighth Amendment, to allow the government to legislate terminations.A Yes vote would mean that the text added to the constitution back in 1983 and 1992 would be changed to: ‘Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.’Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Sinn Fein and the Labour Party all support #Repealthe8th.

There might also be a dash of glamour from the younger generation, such as the Duke of Kent’s granddaughter, Lady Amelia WindsorBut what about the newlyweds, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex, who are starting married life in modest Nottingham Cottage, just across from the Michaels’ apartment? Might they attend?And WHAT of Princess Eugenie and her wine merchant fiancé Jack Brooksbank, who have quietly moved into nearby Ivy Cottage, five months ahead of their wedding?What is clear is that the anniversaries, weddings, parties and comings and goings have shone an intriguing spotlight on the palace dubbed the poshest public housing project in Britain, which accommodates an extended family ranging in age from Prince Louis at just 33 days old to the Duke of Kent who is 83 in October.It is ironic that not long after Princess Michael was receiving the key to Diana’s secret garden, the very future of Kensington Palace was in doubt.The Princess’s death, and then that of Princess Margaret in 2002, led to courtiers drawing up a plan to convert the palace into a permanent home for the treasures and artworks of the Royal Collection.The only stumbling block was that it was still a home for those hard-working but minor members of the Royal Family, and where would they go? One possibility was that they could retire to their country homes.The Queen, however, did not welcome the idea of pensioning off loyal family members who do much of the less glamorous royal work without a murmur of complaint. And, besides, none has a country home to retire to any more.The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester gave up Barnwell Manor, in Northamptonshire, because the income from its farm was not enough to meet the upkeep and it was leased to an international antiques company. They do, however, have a small weekend cottage in Gloucestershire.          But what about the newlyweds, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex, who are starting married life in modest Nottingham Cottage, just across from the Michaels’ apartment? Might they attend?As full-time working royals, the Gloucesters and the Duke and Duchess of Kent, whose home is Wren Cottage, close to Harry and Eugenie’s homes, live rent-free.As for Prince and Princess Michael, after being obliged to take over the £120,000-a-year rent on their palace apartment from the Queen following a public outcry, they sold Nether Lypiatt, their manor house in Gloucestershire — to Labour peer Lord Drayson for £5.75 million — to pay for it.Asked if it would have been better to have bought another home, Princess Michael admitted: ‘We did cost it out, but we’d have to rent garages and an office. And the thing is security. Security is very expensive. So we’d have to pay for that as well.’Friends of the couple say they will never leave Kensington Palace. ‘KP means everything to them,’ says one. ‘Michael is an HRH, the grandson of a king (George V) and the Queen promised when they married that they would always have a home at the palace.’          And WHAT of Princess Eugenie and her wine merchant fiancé Jack Brooksbank, who have quietly moved into nearby Ivy Cottage, five months ahead of their wedding?So what is life like in this aristocratic communal settlement, and do they all rub along or are they at daggers drawn? Last month, Aatish Taseer, ex-boyfriend of the couple’s daughter, Lady Gabriella Windsor, penned a lurid article about their relationship in which he called Kensington Palace ‘wildly depressing’.He added: ‘All the famous inhabitants — Princess Margaret, Princess Diana — were dead, and those who remained, minor royals and palace secretaries, lived in their long, cold shadow. (In perpetual fear, I should add, of being turfed out.)’But instead of being closed down, the palace has flourished. The arrival of Prince William and Kate, who with their three children, now occupy Apartment 1a, the 22-room former home of Princess Margaret following a £4.5 million refurbishment — including two kitchens — mostly at taxpayers’ expense, changed everything.As Taseer wrote: ‘Will and Kate arrived to liven up the place.’ Harry followed, with Meghan moving in with him after their engagement.          In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doorsHow long they will stay in Nottingham Cottage remains to be seen. A modest, two-bedroom dwelling, it was traditionally occupied by royal retainers — home to Princess Margaret’s long-time private secretary Lord Napier, and later Sir Miles Hunt-Davis, Prince Philip’s private secretary.‘Before Meghan arrived, it was like a student or soldier’s digs’, a friend of Prince Harry who visited him there says, simply furnished but with pictures on the walls from the Royal Collection.The young Duchess has changed all that with throws, scatter cushions and scented candles.In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doors.The Gloucesters, said to have made the offer themselves, might in exchange receive the home lived in by Lord (Christopher) Geidt, the Queen’s former private secretary. The father of two, who quit last October, was permitted to remain in his apartment until the end of the school year.          If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9.It is also likely to become the focus of a new royal social salon. A glamorous crowd will be making its way to Kensington Palace.Even so, neither Harry nor William are likely to make it on to Princess Michael’s party guest list.One friend of the Princess says: ‘I asked her how much she saw of Harry and she said she never saw him. That’s the thing about KP, they are cheek by jowl but their lives are separate.‘This explains why the children of the Gloucesters, the Kents and the Michaels, were not invited to Harry and Meghan’s wedding. Even though they all grew up together in the same place, they had totally unconnected lives, different schools, different friends.’There is also the matter of the great stray cats controversy. After two of her treasured pedigree Burmese were injured, Princess Michael called in a pest control firm to trap the strays routinely found in the palace grounds.In one of the traps Diana placed a battery-operated toy cat which miaowed just like the real thing. William and Harry, meanwhile, were taught to shout ‘cat killers!’ at the pest control workmen.The cats weren’t killed, but found homes through the RSPCA. But cats had been a point of conflict between the two women for years.Diana liked to sleep with an open window in summer and Princess Michael’s cats would sometimes climb in and disturb her.On one occasion when Diana phoned to complain, Princess Michael is said to have told an aide: ‘Tell her my cats were here before she was.’In public, the two women were superficially friendly but in private Princess Michael would complain about ‘the stupid girl next door’. For her part, in view of her family’s Nazi past, Diana referred to her as the ‘U-boat commander’.It is also unlikely that Princess Eugenie will be on the party guest list. Princess Michael is no fan of her mother, the Duchess of York.Eugenie, 28, who is an associate director at art gallery Hauser \u0026amp Wirth, and her future husband are privately renting three-bedroom Ivy Cottage, next door to the Duke and Duchess of Kent.A comparable three-bedroom mews house near Hyde Park would cost £3,500 a week. Officials would not say how much the couple have been asked to pay, but it is thought the rent is being met by her father, Prince Andrew.Eugenie had previously been living in a taxpayer-funded four-bedroom apartment in St James’s Palace with her sister Princess Beatrice, 29.Brooksbank, 31, and Eugenie will marry at Windsor Castle in October. The couple have been together for eight years after being introduced by friends in the Swiss ski resort of Verbier, where her parents have a £13 million property.Ivy Cottage was formerly the family home of the deputy director of the palace’s property section. It has been earmarked for Eugenie — though her plans to move in were marred by an alleged row over who should pay the thousands needed to repair a damp problem. It remains unknown whether public money was spent refurbishing the cottage.A source close to Eugenie says she is thrilled to be living next door to Harry and Meghan. ‘Harry and Eugenie are great mates,’ the insider says. ‘She was one of the first of the royals to meet Meghan.’For all the HRHs, the palace residents also include courtiers (who have around 16 per cent of their salary deducted for the privilege) domestic staff and senior military figures. Even members of the public pay the market rent for accommodation, including a cosmetics boss and a City high-flyer. In return, they get armed police security, their own telephone switchboard and a team of craftsmen and gardeners.Among residents are the Queen’s page Barry Mitford, Buckingham Palace foreman and furniture conservator Richard Thompson and senior surveyor Louis Randall. They are all said to get on with their lords and masters.But when your home depends on job security, it can be unsettling.For example, when the late Sir John Riddell was removed as Charles’s private secretary he complained not about his sacking but that his wife had just spent a large sum on made-to-measure curtains they could never use.For the older royals, the new arrivals will mean little change to the rhythms of life at Kensington Palace. But for Princess Michael, it might just be her last summer as the party queen. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/13/4C9DC0CA00000578-0-image-a-93_1527250987996.jpg","title":"The Hipster Fascists Meet Britains sinister far Right group","story":"    Tom Dupre is the leader of the far-Right group Generation Identity (GI UK) and is openly an admirer of Enoch Powell, the Tory minister best known for his 1968 Rivers of Blood speech It is no surprise to learn that Dupre is a fan of the late politician. The former junior city banker is the leader of a new far-Right movement in Britain called Generation Identity (GI UK).Unlike the traditional image of the far-Right, epitomised by shaven-headed thugs from groups such as the English Defence League and National Action, Tom Dupre is well-spoken, educated, polite and personable.

They’ve been accused of using modern branding and sophisticated coded language to ‘normalise’ extremist views.But Dupre insists Generation Identity is neither fascist nor racist, despite the fact that it is campaigning to preserve ‘our ethnocultural identity’ against what it describes as the ‘great replacement’ of white people in Britain’s cities with black and minority ethnic people.    The group, which includes Benjamin Jones, pictured, has been dubbed \u0027Hipster Fascists\u0027The rhetoric echoes Powell’s infamous speech, in which he recounted a conversation he’d had with a middle-aged constituent who had voiced his fear that ‘in this country in 15 or 20 years’ time, the black man will have the whip hand over the white man’.The words, spoken 50 years apart, might be different, but the message delivered by Tom Dupre and Enoch Powell is the same.Posters in Manchester last week reinforced that message, declaring that ‘each new census heralds the end of England and the English. By 2061, we will be nothing more than a footnote in the history books.’The group, which claims to have members in every major city in the country, was launched last summer in the UK with a banner being unveiled on Westminster Bridge reading: Defend London — Stop Islamisation. It was emblazoned with the ‘lambda’ symbol, the 11th letter of the Greek alphabet, which has become the official logo of GI UK.The lambda is synonymous with the ancient military republic of Sparta, famous in battle for being ‘a patriotic army defending its native soil’.The symbolism is obvious.          Jordan Diamond, pictured, who is a leading member of the group, has been previously filmed expressing his concern about being \u0027swamped by the third world\u0027GI UK members come from ‘all walks’ of life, the promotional material informs us. However, the leadership is exclusively middle class, as are many of its activists. Universities up and down the country have been targeted for potential recruits.Tom Dupre himself grew up in a six-bedroom £1 million home in Sevenoaks, Kent. His parents were co-directors of a firm of insurance brokers his mother, a volunteer with the Samaritans, ran a local children’s choir. Both his brother and sister, an opera singer, went to Cambridge. A more unlikely family background for a far-Right leader would to be hard to imagine.Dupre studied psychology at Bristol University, speaks several languages and is an accomplished clarinet player.Until this week, he worked for Standard Chartered in the bank’s glass-fronted HQ in the heart of the City, near Mansion House, where a bright future beckoned until his political activities came to light last weekend. He was dismissed a few days ago following an internal investigation.Dupre’s closest associate is Ben Jones, the 24-year-old co-leader of Generation Identity. At first glance, his life is a picture of suburban respectability. He lives in the Midlands with his fiancée and two border collies. Jones has a degree in journalism and works in marketing.A third key figure within the organisation is Belfast-born Deirdre McTucker, 38. She graduated, she says in her online CV, in business management and economics from prestigious University College Dublin, before joining a number of firms in the U.S. including the Federal Aviation Administration and Saab. She has also run her own video production company.‘We want to bring a revival to our culture and our way of life,’ she said in a recent newspaper interview. ‘Our biggest concern, of course, is becoming a minority in our own country.’ GI UK founding members also include the son of an accountant and an IT specialist with a leading cyber security firm.So, the demographic make-up of GI UK could not be more different from the English Defence League or the banned National Action. The tactics of this group are very different, too. There have, for example, been no provocative marches, no clenched fists and no violence.Still, in under a year, Generation Identity has become the most active far-Right organisation in Britain.In place of rallies, they like to spread their message through meetings, leaflet-drops, recruitment drives and ‘study circles’.It is within these seemingly civilised gatherings, which have been held in towns and cities from Luton to the Lake District, that activists discuss ‘identitarian’ ideology. Word of these meetings tends to be featured on GI UK’s Facebook page.One photograph on Facebook shows young Tom Dupre and two supporters, wearing bright yellow waterproof tops with the lambda logo, handing out food to the homeless at King’s Cross and Moorgate stations in London.‘Warm pork suppers’ were deliberately chosen to exclude Muslims, claim anti-fascist campaigners.Dupre strenuously denies this. ‘It had nothing to do with being anti-Muslim,’ he insisted to the Mail.But he did go on record to confess that he does not regard Mayor of London Sadiq Khan as European. Not because he is a Muslim, he says, but because ‘he’s against British values’.          Belfast-born Deirdre McTucker, who attended University College Dublin, said in one newspaper interview \u0027our biggest concern is becoming a minority in our own country\u0027You may well not know this, but last December, GI UK staged a tasteless publicity stunt to embarrass Mr Khan. Someone playing the part of the Mayor, accompanied by two people in niqabs, went to Westminster Abbey and St Paul’s Cathedral to ask people to sign a petition to ‘ban Christmas’. Thankfully, the stunt received little publicity.Generation Identity’s first British conference was held last month — in Tom Dupre’s home town.The gathering at The Stag Theatre in Sevenoaks, Kent, ended with the police being called when anti-fascist protesters, in black balaclavas, descended on the venue. Witnesses described how a young GI member was chased across the car park by masked men — proof that extremism, even when it is clothed in middle-class normality, almost always breeds more extremism.The conference was news-worthy for another reason. Two senior GI figures from Europe — one of them was Austrian Martin Sellner — were detained and deported as they tried to enter the country to attend the event. This is evidence, if any were needed, that the authorities are not taking the potential threat posed by GI UK lightly.GI UK is part of a 13-nation European network which claims to have thousands of supporters in France, Germany and Austria, and an extensive infrastructure including branded bars and gyms.Unlike their British counterparts, the methods employed by European ‘Identitarians’ are far less subtle. They have mounted missions to ‘defend Europe’. They have chartered boats to disrupt operations in the Mediterranean to rescue refugees, and have conducted ‘patrols’ of the French border in the Alps.Sellner, a student of law and philosophy, who makes a living as a graphic designer, is the leading GI figure on the Continent. Often seen wearing Ray-Ban sunglasses, he has strong links with his counterparts in Britain.After being prevented from attending the conference in Sevenoaks, he instead spoke to Tom Dupre, live on stage, via a video link.The European experience of this group offers a salutary warning for Britain.‘Identitarians’ argue that globalisation has created a homogenous culture with no distinct national or cultural identities. This can only be reversed, they claim, by ‘remigration’.In Britain, critics insist, this would mean the forced removal and repatriation of non-white and Muslim immigrants who GI UK believe shouldn’t be resident here. Such a credo took hold in France around six years ago and has grown stronger following the wave of ISIS terror attacks across Europe.What is happening in Europe was exposed by undercover reporters from ITV last year. In a documentary, members of Generation Identity were seen practising hand-to-hand combat at an ‘Identitarian Summer University’ in France.This was, in effect, a military-style training camp. Members were also filmed taking part in a mock demonstration (complete with pepper spray) before ‘passing out’, wearing uniforms bearing GI’s distinctive lambda logo.Jordan Diamond, one of the early leaders of GI UK, has been filmed attending other GI events with Martin Sellner. Diamond, smartly-suited and in his early 20s, who was brought up in a picture postcard village in the North- West of England, has been recorded talking about his fears of being ‘swamped’ by the Third World.‘Would you,’ he has asked rhetorically, ‘be happy, honestly, if white people didn’t exist? Because naturally, at the rate it’s going, we’re not going to.’Diamond insisted, however, that he was not racist, arguing that no indigenous population should become a minority in its own land. He has said that he does not condone violence.In other footage online, Diamond has spoken about the need to mobilise ‘99ers’. These are young people born since the Millennium, whom he wants to be taught to protect what he describes as their ‘white heritage’.‘We’ve not got much time,’ he said in one address. ‘When the 99ers turn 30, our fate will be sealed. It’s down to our generation to make some change.’Diamond’s childhood home is in a millionaires’ row of mock Tudor houses and gated walled mansions. Diamond’s father is an accountant with the NHS and his mother is a music teacher. A sports car was parked on the drive earlier this week. Neighbours of the family say their son went to university.On Twitter, where he has 2,500 followers, Diamond describes himself as an ‘identitarian’ and quotes Winston Churchill: ‘There is a forgotten, nay almost forbidden word, which means more to me than any other. That word is England.’Back in Sevenoaks, Tom Dupre, described by one who used to know him as ‘a lovely lad from a very liberal family’, declined to say what his friends, parents and extended family think of his views.However, he insisted: ‘We reject racism. We are not fascist.‘We do not want to throw all foreign people out of England. We’re not against all immigration or all immigrants at all.‘But my generation is much more concerned about the issues we are raising than people who grew up in the 1980s and 1990s.‘We have grown up with terrorist attacks in London. I was just seven years old when I saw the Twin Towers collapsing on the TV. It did not make sense to me. A lot of people my age feel the same way.’Yet, critics claim that behind the slick branding and expertly produced promotional videos of Generation Identity lies an ugly message of white supremacy and ‘racial separatism’.These young men might look the picture of respectability with their snazzy suits, fashionable labels and super-cool haircuts. Their rhetoric, however, tells a different story.One of Tom Dupre’s big questions during a recent address to a GI convention was: ‘Are we a threat?’ Compared to the bomber jackets and beer bellies of the English Defence League, the answer, quite possibly, is very much, yes.Additional reporting: Stephanie Condron and Mark Branagan"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/16/4C9F5FA300000578-0-image-m-68_1527260898804.jpg","title":"Actress Maureen Lipman faints stage West End performance","story":"    Actress Maureen Lipman has fainted on stage during a West End performanceJames Norton dons spectacles and a retro woollen suit as he...Share this articleAn employee at the theatre said: \u0027She did faint, but everything seems to be fine, she did not go to hospital or anything, she just went home for the evening.\u0027Quizzed on how Lipman was, they said: \u0027I did not see anything wrong, she was alert and talked normally - I don\u0027t know why she fainted but as far as I could tell she seemed fine.\u0027It is understood the show stopped for around 10 minutes after she became unwell, restarting with someone else playing her character. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/22/4CA1FC1800000578-0-image-m-14_1527284019981.jpg","title":"Irn Bru recall ordered glass bottles tops pop off","story":"    AG Barr is recalling its 750ml glass bottles of products including Irn-Bru after reports that the caps have been popping off some of the bottles. Bottles of legendary Scottish drink Irn-Bru are being recalled as some of the caps have been popping off unexpectedly. AG Barr has announced the voluntary recall as a result of what the company describes as an \u0027intermittent fault\u0027. Consumers have noted a small number of incidents involving drinks such as Irn-Bru, Irn-Bru sugar free, Irn-Bru Xtra, Cola, Cream Soda and Ginger Beer with use-by dates up to and including May 2019.Bottles of Lemonade, Limeade, Pineapple, Red Kola and Soda Water are also covered by the recall notice.Anyone who has bought a bottle is advised to open it carefully like a bottle of sparking wine and then return it to AG Barr.The company said: \u0027We have identified an intermittent fault in how some caps have been applied across our 750ml glass bottles.\u0027Laugh at me or laugh with me, it\u0027s all fine by me\u0027:...Share this article\u0027The quality of the drink itself is not affected, however the issue may cause a small number of caps to pop off unexpectedly.\u0027As a precautionary measure we are asking consumers who have any of the products detailed to open the bottles with care to release the pressure.\u0027The bottle should be handled carefully, pointed away from the body at arm\u0027s length, as you would when opening a bottle of sparkling wine.\u0027          The company has asked customers to carefully open the bottles \u0027like sparkling wine\u0027 file photoThe company added: \u0027At AG Barr plc we take great care to ensure that our products reach our consumers and customers in perfect condition and are sorry that on this occasion a limited quantity of our products has not met expectations.\u0027Anyone who has any of the affected products at home is asked to contact AG Barr on consumercare@agbarr.co.uk.Point-of-sale notices will be displayed in all retail stores that are selling the products explaining to customers why the bottles are being recalled and telling them what to do if they have bought the product.Food Standards Scotland (FSS) said: \u0027The company has already taken steps to remove these products from the market.\u0027However, if you have bought the products listed please carefully open at arm\u0027s length to release the pressure and return to the store or contact AG Barr directly.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/01/4C9AF73800000578-0-image-m-23_1527209693669.jpg","title":"Petrol prices single day store chains","story":"    Supermarkets in the UK have increased their petrol and diesel prices every day since the end of MarchNot such a bright spark!

As we continue to make using a handheld mobile behind the wheel as socially unacceptable as drink-driving, we would hope to see an even bigger reduction in those going to court throughout 2018.’He added: ‘You are twice as likely to crash while text-driving as drink-driving, so the best way for drivers to avoid picking up their phone is to turn the phone off before their journey and convert their glove box into a phone box.’Despite the figures being hailed as a success, there are concerns that the fall in convictions could also be due to fewer people being caught after a drop in the number of frontline traffic police officers. The number of road police officers fell by nearly a third between 2007 and 2017, from 3,766 to 2,643.

There might also be a dash of glamour from the younger generation, such as the Duke of Kent’s granddaughter, Lady Amelia WindsorBut what about the newlyweds, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex, who are starting married life in modest Nottingham Cottage, just across from the Michaels’ apartment? Might they attend?And WHAT of Princess Eugenie and her wine merchant fiancé Jack Brooksbank, who have quietly moved into nearby Ivy Cottage, five months ahead of their wedding?What is clear is that the anniversaries, weddings, parties and comings and goings have shone an intriguing spotlight on the palace dubbed the poshest public housing project in Britain, which accommodates an extended family ranging in age from Prince Louis at just 33 days old to the Duke of Kent who is 83 in October.It is ironic that not long after Princess Michael was receiving the key to Diana’s secret garden, the very future of Kensington Palace was in doubt.The Princess’s death, and then that of Princess Margaret in 2002, led to courtiers drawing up a plan to convert the palace into a permanent home for the treasures and artworks of the Royal Collection.The only stumbling block was that it was still a home for those hard-working but minor members of the Royal Family, and where would they go? One possibility was that they could retire to their country homes.The Queen, however, did not welcome the idea of pensioning off loyal family members who do much of the less glamorous royal work without a murmur of complaint. And, besides, none has a country home to retire to any more.The Duke and Duchess of Gloucester gave up Barnwell Manor, in Northamptonshire, because the income from its farm was not enough to meet the upkeep and it was leased to an international antiques company. They do, however, have a small weekend cottage in Gloucestershire.          But what about the newlyweds, Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex, who are starting married life in modest Nottingham Cottage, just across from the Michaels’ apartment? Might they attend?As full-time working royals, the Gloucesters and the Duke and Duchess of Kent, whose home is Wren Cottage, close to Harry and Eugenie’s homes, live rent-free.As for Prince and Princess Michael, after being obliged to take over the £120,000-a-year rent on their palace apartment from the Queen following a public outcry, they sold Nether Lypiatt, their manor house in Gloucestershire — to Labour peer Lord Drayson for £5.75 million — to pay for it.Asked if it would have been better to have bought another home, Princess Michael admitted: ‘We did cost it out, but we’d have to rent garages and an office. And the thing is security. Security is very expensive. So we’d have to pay for that as well.’Friends of the couple say they will never leave Kensington Palace. ‘KP means everything to them,’ says one. ‘Michael is an HRH, the grandson of a king (George V) and the Queen promised when they married that they would always have a home at the palace.’          And WHAT of Princess Eugenie and her wine merchant fiancé Jack Brooksbank, who have quietly moved into nearby Ivy Cottage, five months ahead of their wedding?So what is life like in this aristocratic communal settlement, and do they all rub along or are they at daggers drawn? Last month, Aatish Taseer, ex-boyfriend of the couple’s daughter, Lady Gabriella Windsor, penned a lurid article about their relationship in which he called Kensington Palace ‘wildly depressing’.He added: ‘All the famous inhabitants — Princess Margaret, Princess Diana — were dead, and those who remained, minor royals and palace secretaries, lived in their long, cold shadow. (In perpetual fear, I should add, of being turfed out.)’But instead of being closed down, the palace has flourished. The arrival of Prince William and Kate, who with their three children, now occupy Apartment 1a, the 22-room former home of Princess Margaret following a £4.5 million refurbishment — including two kitchens — mostly at taxpayers’ expense, changed everything.As Taseer wrote: ‘Will and Kate arrived to liven up the place.’ Harry followed, with Meghan moving in with him after their engagement.          In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doorsHow long they will stay in Nottingham Cottage remains to be seen. A modest, two-bedroom dwelling, it was traditionally occupied by royal retainers — home to Princess Margaret’s long-time private secretary Lord Napier, and later Sir Miles Hunt-Davis, Prince Philip’s private secretary.‘Before Meghan arrived, it was like a student or soldier’s digs’, a friend of Prince Harry who visited him there says, simply furnished but with pictures on the walls from the Royal Collection.The young Duchess has changed all that with throws, scatter cushions and scented candles.In royal circles it is widely expected the couple will trade up and move into the Gloucesters’ 21-room pile Apartment 1, right next door to William and Kate. The two properties have adjoining front doors.The Gloucesters, said to have made the offer themselves, might in exchange receive the home lived in by Lord (Christopher) Geidt, the Queen’s former private secretary. The father of two, who quit last October, was permitted to remain in his apartment until the end of the school year.          If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9If Harry and Meghan move next door to William and Kate, it will certainly be exciting and inevitably bring back memories of the years when they were boys living with their mother in apartments 8 and 9.It is also likely to become the focus of a new royal social salon. A glamorous crowd will be making its way to Kensington Palace.Even so, neither Harry nor William are likely to make it on to Princess Michael’s party guest list.One friend of the Princess says: ‘I asked her how much she saw of Harry and she said she never saw him. That’s the thing about KP, they are cheek by jowl but their lives are separate.‘This explains why the children of the Gloucesters, the Kents and the Michaels, were not invited to Harry and Meghan’s wedding. Even though they all grew up together in the same place, they had totally unconnected lives, different schools, different friends.’There is also the matter of the great stray cats controversy. After two of her treasured pedigree Burmese were injured, Princess Michael called in a pest control firm to trap the strays routinely found in the palace grounds.In one of the traps Diana placed a battery-operated toy cat which miaowed just like the real thing. William and Harry, meanwhile, were taught to shout ‘cat killers!’ at the pest control workmen.The cats weren’t killed, but found homes through the RSPCA. But cats had been a point of conflict between the two women for years.Diana liked to sleep with an open window in summer and Princess Michael’s cats would sometimes climb in and disturb her.On one occasion when Diana phoned to complain, Princess Michael is said to have told an aide: ‘Tell her my cats were here before she was.’In public, the two women were superficially friendly but in private Princess Michael would complain about ‘the stupid girl next door’. For her part, in view of her family’s Nazi past, Diana referred to her as the ‘U-boat commander’.It is also unlikely that Princess Eugenie will be on the party guest list. Princess Michael is no fan of her mother, the Duchess of York.Eugenie, 28, who is an associate director at art gallery Hauser \u0026amp Wirth, and her future husband are privately renting three-bedroom Ivy Cottage, next door to the Duke and Duchess of Kent.A comparable three-bedroom mews house near Hyde Park would cost £3,500 a week. Officials would not say how much the couple have been asked to pay, but it is thought the rent is being met by her father, Prince Andrew.Eugenie had previously been living in a taxpayer-funded four-bedroom apartment in St James’s Palace with her sister Princess Beatrice, 29.Brooksbank, 31, and Eugenie will marry at Windsor Castle in October. The couple have been together for eight years after being introduced by friends in the Swiss ski resort of Verbier, where her parents have a £13 million property.Ivy Cottage was formerly the family home of the deputy director of the palace’s property section. It has been earmarked for Eugenie — though her plans to move in were marred by an alleged row over who should pay the thousands needed to repair a damp problem. It remains unknown whether public money was spent refurbishing the cottage.A source close to Eugenie says she is thrilled to be living next door to Harry and Meghan. ‘Harry and Eugenie are great mates,’ the insider says. ‘She was one of the first of the royals to meet Meghan.’For all the HRHs, the palace residents also include courtiers (who have around 16 per cent of their salary deducted for the privilege) domestic staff and senior military figures. Even members of the public pay the market rent for accommodation, including a cosmetics boss and a City high-flyer. In return, they get armed police security, their own telephone switchboard and a team of craftsmen and gardeners.Among residents are the Queen’s page Barry Mitford, Buckingham Palace foreman and furniture conservator Richard Thompson and senior surveyor Louis Randall. They are all said to get on with their lords and masters.But when your home depends on job security, it can be unsettling.For example, when the late Sir John Riddell was removed as Charles’s private secretary he complained not about his sacking but that his wife had just spent a large sum on made-to-measure curtains they could never use.For the older royals, the new arrivals will mean little change to the rhythms of life at Kensington Palace. But for Princess Michael, it might just be her last summer as the party queen. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/13/4C9DC0CA00000578-0-image-a-93_1527250987996.jpg","title":"The Hipster Fascists Meet Britains sinister far Right group","story":"    Tom Dupre is the leader of the far-Right group Generation Identity (GI UK) and is openly an admirer of Enoch Powell, the Tory minister best known for his 1968 Rivers of Blood speech It is no surprise to learn that Dupre is a fan of the late politician. The former junior city banker is the leader of a new far-Right movement in Britain called Generation Identity (GI UK).Unlike the traditional image of the far-Right, epitomised by shaven-headed thugs from groups such as the English Defence League and National Action, Tom Dupre is well-spoken, educated, polite and personable. It makes him more plausible and, ultimately perhaps, more dangerous than the easily-dismissed stereotypes from this end of the political spectrum which we have become accustomed to.The bank holiday getaway heats up! Millions take to the...Two British tourists are arrested over the suspected rape of...Share this articleHe was smartly dressed in a business suit during our encounter with him, but slick publicity photos of him and his fellow ‘patriots’, as they like to call themselves, show them in skinny jeans, trendy trainers and sunglasses with some sporting upswept hair and beards.The Sunday Times has described them as the ‘Hipster Fascists’. They’ve been accused of using modern branding and sophisticated coded language to ‘normalise’ extremist views.But Dupre insists Generation Identity is neither fascist nor racist, despite the fact that it is campaigning to preserve ‘our ethnocultural identity’ against what it describes as the ‘great replacement’ of white people in Britain’s cities with black and minority ethnic people.    The group, which includes Benjamin Jones, pictured, has been dubbed \u0027Hipster Fascists\u0027The rhetoric echoes Powell’s infamous speech, in which he recounted a conversation he’d had with a middle-aged constituent who had voiced his fear that ‘in this country in 15 or 20 years’ time, the black man will have the whip hand over the white man’.The words, spoken 50 years apart, might be different, but the message delivered by Tom Dupre and Enoch Powell is the same.Posters in Manchester last week reinforced that message, declaring that ‘each new census heralds the end of England and the English. By 2061, we will be nothing more than a footnote in the history books.’The group, which claims to have members in every major city in the country, was launched last summer in the UK with a banner being unveiled on Westminster Bridge reading: Defend London — Stop Islamisation. It was emblazoned with the ‘lambda’ symbol, the 11th letter of the Greek alphabet, which has become the official logo of GI UK.The lambda is synonymous with the ancient military republic of Sparta, famous in battle for being ‘a patriotic army defending its native soil’.The symbolism is obvious.          Jordan Diamond, pictured, who is a leading member of the group, has been previously filmed expressing his concern about being \u0027swamped by the third world\u0027GI UK members come from ‘all walks’ of life, the promotional material informs us. However, the leadership is exclusively middle class, as are many of its activists. Universities up and down the country have been targeted for potential recruits.Tom Dupre himself grew up in a six-bedroom £1 million home in Sevenoaks, Kent. His parents were co-directors of a firm of insurance brokers his mother, a volunteer with the Samaritans, ran a local children’s choir. Both his brother and sister, an opera singer, went to Cambridge. A more unlikely family background for a far-Right leader would to be hard to imagine.Dupre studied psychology at Bristol University, speaks several languages and is an accomplished clarinet player.Until this week, he worked for Standard Chartered in the bank’s glass-fronted HQ in the heart of the City, near Mansion House, where a bright future beckoned until his political activities came to light last weekend. He was dismissed a few days ago following an internal investigation.Dupre’s closest associate is Ben Jones, the 24-year-old co-leader of Generation Identity. At first glance, his life is a picture of suburban respectability. He lives in the Midlands with his fiancée and two border collies. Jones has a degree in journalism and works in marketing.A third key figure within the organisation is Belfast-born Deirdre McTucker, 38. She graduated, she says in her online CV, in business management and economics from prestigious University College Dublin, before joining a number of firms in the U.S. including the Federal Aviation Administration and Saab. She has also run her own video production company.‘We want to bring a revival to our culture and our way of life,’ she said in a recent newspaper interview. ‘Our biggest concern, of course, is becoming a minority in our own country.’ GI UK founding members also include the son of an accountant and an IT specialist with a leading cyber security firm.So, the demographic make-up of GI UK could not be more different from the English Defence League or the banned National Action. The tactics of this group are very different, too. There have, for example, been no provocative marches, no clenched fists and no violence.Still, in under a year, Generation Identity has become the most active far-Right organisation in Britain.In place of rallies, they like to spread their message through meetings, leaflet-drops, recruitment drives and ‘study circles’.It is within these seemingly civilised gatherings, which have been held in towns and cities from Luton to the Lake District, that activists discuss ‘identitarian’ ideology. Word of these meetings tends to be featured on GI UK’s Facebook page.One photograph on Facebook shows young Tom Dupre and two supporters, wearing bright yellow waterproof tops with the lambda logo, handing out food to the homeless at King’s Cross and Moorgate stations in London.‘Warm pork suppers’ were deliberately chosen to exclude Muslims, claim anti-fascist campaigners.Dupre strenuously denies this. ‘It had nothing to do with being anti-Muslim,’ he insisted to the Mail.But he did go on record to confess that he does not regard Mayor of London Sadiq Khan as European. Not because he is a Muslim, he says, but because ‘he’s against British values’.          Belfast-born Deirdre McTucker, who attended University College Dublin, said in one newspaper interview \u0027our biggest concern is becoming a minority in our own country\u0027You may well not know this, but last December, GI UK staged a tasteless publicity stunt to embarrass Mr Khan. Someone playing the part of the Mayor, accompanied by two people in niqabs, went to Westminster Abbey and St Paul’s Cathedral to ask people to sign a petition to ‘ban Christmas’. Thankfully, the stunt received little publicity.Generation Identity’s first British conference was held last month — in Tom Dupre’s home town.The gathering at The Stag Theatre in Sevenoaks, Kent, ended with the police being called when anti-fascist protesters, in black balaclavas, descended on the venue. Witnesses described how a young GI member was chased across the car park by masked men — proof that extremism, even when it is clothed in middle-class normality, almost always breeds more extremism.The conference was news-worthy for another reason. Two senior GI figures from Europe — one of them was Austrian Martin Sellner — were detained and deported as they tried to enter the country to attend the event. This is evidence, if any were needed, that the authorities are not taking the potential threat posed by GI UK lightly.GI UK is part of a 13-nation European network which claims to have thousands of supporters in France, Germany and Austria, and an extensive infrastructure including branded bars and gyms.Unlike their British counterparts, the methods employed by European ‘Identitarians’ are far less subtle. They have mounted missions to ‘defend Europe’. They have chartered boats to disrupt operations in the Mediterranean to rescue refugees, and have conducted ‘patrols’ of the French border in the Alps.Sellner, a student of law and philosophy, who makes a living as a graphic designer, is the leading GI figure on the Continent. Often seen wearing Ray-Ban sunglasses, he has strong links with his counterparts in Britain.After being prevented from attending the conference in Sevenoaks, he instead spoke to Tom Dupre, live on stage, via a video link.The European experience of this group offers a salutary warning for Britain.‘Identitarians’ argue that globalisation has created a homogenous culture with no distinct national or cultural identities. This can only be reversed, they claim, by ‘remigration’.In Britain, critics insist, this would mean the forced removal and repatriation of non-white and Muslim immigrants who GI UK believe shouldn’t be resident here. Such a credo took hold in France around six years ago and has grown stronger following the wave of ISIS terror attacks across Europe.What is happening in Europe was exposed by undercover reporters from ITV last year. In a documentary, members of Generation Identity were seen practising hand-to-hand combat at an ‘Identitarian Summer University’ in France.This was, in effect, a military-style training camp. Members were also filmed taking part in a mock demonstration (complete with pepper spray) before ‘passing out’, wearing uniforms bearing GI’s distinctive lambda logo.Jordan Diamond, one of the early leaders of GI UK, has been filmed attending other GI events with Martin Sellner. Diamond, smartly-suited and in his early 20s, who was brought up in a picture postcard village in the North- West of England, has been recorded talking about his fears of being ‘swamped’ by the Third World.‘Would you,’ he has asked rhetorically, ‘be happy, honestly, if white people didn’t exist? Because naturally, at the rate it’s going, we’re not going to.’Diamond insisted, however, that he was not racist, arguing that no indigenous population should become a minority in its own land. He has said that he does not condone violence.In other footage online, Diamond has spoken about the need to mobilise ‘99ers’. These are young people born since the Millennium, whom he wants to be taught to protect what he describes as their ‘white heritage’.‘We’ve not got much time,’ he said in one address. ‘When the 99ers turn 30, our fate will be sealed. It’s down to our generation to make some change.’Diamond’s childhood home is in a millionaires’ row of mock Tudor houses and gated walled mansions. Diamond’s father is an accountant with the NHS and his mother is a music teacher. A sports car was parked on the drive earlier this week. Neighbours of the family say their son went to university.On Twitter, where he has 2,500 followers, Diamond describes himself as an ‘identitarian’ and quotes Winston Churchill: ‘There is a forgotten, nay almost forbidden word, which means more to me than any other. That word is England.’Back in Sevenoaks, Tom Dupre, described by one who used to know him as ‘a lovely lad from a very liberal family’, declined to say what his friends, parents and extended family think of his views.However, he insisted: ‘We reject racism. We are not fascist.‘We do not want to throw all foreign people out of England. We’re not against all immigration or all immigrants at all.‘But my generation is much more concerned about the issues we are raising than people who grew up in the 1980s and 1990s.‘We have grown up with terrorist attacks in London. I was just seven years old when I saw the Twin Towers collapsing on the TV. It did not make sense to me. A lot of people my age feel the same way.’Yet, critics claim that behind the slick branding and expertly produced promotional videos of Generation Identity lies an ugly message of white supremacy and ‘racial separatism’.These young men might look the picture of respectability with their snazzy suits, fashionable labels and super-cool haircuts. Their rhetoric, however, tells a different story.One of Tom Dupre’s big questions during a recent address to a GI convention was: ‘Are we a threat?’ Compared to the bomber jackets and beer bellies of the English Defence League, the answer, quite possibly, is very much, yes.Additional reporting: Stephanie Condron and Mark Branagan"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/25/01/4C9AF73800000578-0-image-m-23_1527209693669.jpg","title":"Petrol prices single day store chains","story":"    Supermarkets in the UK have increased their petrol and diesel prices every day since the end of MarchNot such a bright spark!

Sheila Heti talks about self-belief and the joy of failureHer deeply personal first novel ided critics, her new one explores the choice not to have children. Sheila Heti talks about self-belief and the joy of failureWhen Sheila Heti’s novel, Motherhood, was published in the US, many of the reviews opened with personal experiences. The book, which describes a female writer in her late 30s (in many ways indistinguishable from Heti) reaching a decision not to have children, is a sometimes frenzied, sometimes laconic, often very funny meditation on the ambivalent state in which many women find themselves in their late 30s, and has been received in a way that rather grimly underscores the themes of the novel: that a great many women take other women’s decisions about motherhood as a direct rebuke to their own. If a review starts along the lines of “when I had my first child … ” you know Heti is in for a rough time.At 41, the author herself is no longer agonised part of the purpose of writing the book was to get over the decision: “It’s a scary thing to look into,” she says. We are in a hotel in downtown Manhattan, where she is staying while visiting from her native Toronto. She is slight, her voice infused with a levity that has been lost in much of the commentary around Motherhood and that is a central quality of Heti’s writing, from 2005’s Ticknor, her first novel, to 2010’s How Should a Person Be?Motherhood is in some ways a more avant garde project than the other books, somewhat formless, necessarily obsessive, rigorously limited to the question at hand, and at the same time by far the most mainstream of her novels. Ticknor, for example, is about the relationship between two relatively obscure 19th-century writers, William Hickling Prescott and George Ticknor. Even choosing to write about motherhood, or in Heti’s case the decision not to become a mother, is a source of anxiety and shame, and I say that as someone who has just written a book about having kids. “I had that feeling of embarrassment, too,” says Heti. “Like, am I really going to do this? And why? It’s such a huge, monumental, essence-of-life topic. We all have mothers. Why is this chick-lit? Or – I don’t know exactly what the feeling about it is.” She bursts into laughter.When the novel opens, the Heti character is 36 and living with her boyfriend who has a child from a previous relationship and doesn’t want any more, but informs her she’s welcome to try to persuade him. Meanwhile she’s not even sure she can persuade herself. But – and this was part of Heti’s purpose in writing the novel – it seemed important not to sleepwalk through the decision.“That was the one thing I really didn’t want for myself which was to let it happen to me. And I think for a lot of people, that would be their preference. I have a friend who was like, I can have a baby, it’s no big deal, it’s just so burdensome the idea that I have to think about it. For me it was like, I don’t think I could live with myself if I wasn’t thoughtful about it.”And yet for many women, it is a decision over which, I think, they assume they have limited control. “Yes, they say the superstitious thing of ‘let life happen’. Well, I’m sure those women didn’t do that in every aspect of their lives. Those are people who know how to get what they want. It’s hard to say you don’t want it. It’s like you don’t even believe yourself when you say that.”Some of the criticism around Motherhood has taken on a chiding quality and of course, as Heti points out, “women are as bad as men about all this policing”. Rather than simply railing against the impertinent judgment of others, Heti, in the novel, takes the much more subtle approach of mourning what is lost when someone finds themselves at odds with the mainstream. “There is a kind of sadness in not wanting the things that give so many other people their life’s meaning,” she writes. “There can be sadness at not living out a more universal story – the supposed life cycle.”There is shame attached to not wanting children, Heti says. But I also felt shame for the fierceness with which I wanted kids. “Maybe there’s a basic shame women feel and it just attaches to anything,” she says, laughing. “It’s kind of how I feel about anxiety when you’re an anxious person like I am, I realised at a certain point, it’s not the thing I’m feeling anxious about that is making me anxious, it’s that I have a feeling of anxiety and it attaches to whatever it can. Maybe if we both feel shame it’s because it’s shameful to be a woman. Whatever you choose you feel shame.” She pauses and drily adds, “I wonder if it’s ever going to change, or if women will feel that way until there are no humans ever.”For many years, Heti worked remotely as an editor and writer for the Believer magazine, the literary journal based in San Francisco. She functions best, she says, when she has more than one project on the go and can find relief from one by picking up another. “I just like working. And each is a different kind of work. Sometimes you can’t write a novel for weeks and weeks, but it’s good for your self-esteem to work on something else.” She gave up the Believer when she started putting together Women in Clothes, an anthology of photos, interviews and stories that amounted to a “conversation among hundreds of women” about why we wear what we wear, which she assembled with two writer friends, Heidi Julavits and Leanne Shapton.Every one of Heti’s books has erged radically from what came before, and yet her work is recognisable for the consistency of its humour, and for her desire to get at the truth via unconventional means. She is suspicious of the boundary between fiction and non-fiction. The details of Motherhood are largely autobiographical but the register is fictional. “I don’t know what that line is between fiction and non-fiction that other people have in their minds, but to me when I’m writing it’s just like whatever the next sentence should be is the next sentence. It’s not this artificial ision.”There is a good section in Motherhood about the value of failure, not in the Samuel Beckett sense of fail again, fail better, but in the true wildness of failing in a society that puts so much value on success. “Only in our failures are we absolutely alone,” writes Heti. “Only in the pursuit of failure can a person really be free.” She concludes, “Losers may be the avant garde of the modern age.”She finds failure interesting. For a while, she wondered if she should move to New York, but “I just write better in Toronto than I do anywhere else”, she says. She is wary of what living in New York does to people, “where the bourgeois ideal is so oppressive, and everywhere you look is what you’re supposed to be living up to. The food you eat, everything. There’s no space where you’re not performing. In your bedroom, that lamp or whatever. I like that idea of pursuing failure. It’s just such a relief.”Heti’s writing has been successful. Her novels are the subject of long, serious disquisitions in the New Yorker, where How Should a Person Be? prompted one critic to say of the author: “This talented writer may well have identified a central dialectic of 21st-century postmodern being.” But she has experienced failure in her personal life, she says, notably a short-lived marriage in her mid-20s. She has lived with her boyfriend Lucas, a criminal attorney, for many years, but for a long time she considered her ambivalence towards wanting to have children as an abject failure.She thinks differently now and the way she talks about it is very persuasive. “If there is a longing for babies that women feel, as I’ve heard it described, this very deep yearning, that must be biological – then wouldn’t not feeling it also be biological? There’s always been people in society who don’t have babies this idea of alloparents. It’s a Margaret Mead, anthropological idea, of all these cultures throughout history that have had so-called alloparents, people who help parents raise their children, but are not themselves parents. Aunts, uncles – there is a need in society for people without children. So if there is also a need for children, then maybe some people are given that urge and some people are not. It’s symbiotic.”And yet, as she points out, everyone is subjected to the same “pressure to do it”, so much so that “there is this feeling if you decide not to have children where you want to just tell people, so they stop expecting that of you. And then you also want to tell yourself, so you don’t go on feeling like you’re expecting it of yourself, or like you have to constantly contend with it.”Somewhere in those years between 35 and 40, what Heti realised she really wanted was to throw everything she had at being an artist. Her writing explores the far reaches of experimental fiction, an all-consuming and energy-inefficient way to write, given the amount of material she ends up throwing out. One of the books she had on the back burner while writing Motherhood grew out of Heti alphabetising her diaries – “so it’s like 120,000 words, but the sentences are arranged in alphabetical order. So, all the sentences that start with a, and then b.”How do you even germinate an idea like that?“It came out of a really specific place. I keep diaries, and I keep them on my computer, and I was wondering how much repetition there is in my thoughts. Am I having the same thoughts this year that I was having six years ago? Has anything changed? So I thought that the way to find out would be to see how many times certain sentences repeat how many times did I write ‘I hate him’ or whatever. So I loaded them into Excel and did a whole bunch of tech stuff. It didn’t end up answering that question for me, but that was the start.”She has a publisher interested, but Heti isn’t yet sure whether “I want this in the world, or just for me. I’ve sent it to friends.” This is the grey area out of which so many of her books emerge, a determination to write herself out of an indeterminate state, or what in Motherhood she calls “mush”. “Just give me a form,” she says now. “Let my life have a form. Any form.”It is strange to consider that something as interior and literary as this novel might be used as self-help, but I think it will. It finds the commonality of experience on both sides of the baby ide, in a way that, given how toxic and reductive the subject can be, restores dignity to both. “I hope so,” says Heti. After all, she points out, a novel “doesn’t have a stake in your life like everyone else you know does.” She smiles. “Who should help you if not books?”• Motherhood is published by Harvill Secker."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2b4cb58fa8ab7b6b949e4726ad36910e523a44a/23_138_2423_1454/master/2423.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4dc34f59f6ed002c9c9367a9c90aa346","title":"flotation of saudi oil giant aramco likely to be delayed until 2019","story":"Saudi energy minister hints that record-breaking Aramco IPO is running behind scheduleThe stock market flotation of Saudi Arabia’s state oil company is likely to be delayed until next year, according to the country’s energy minister, confirming mounting speculation that the world’s biggest IPO was running behind schedule.In January the firm lauded a royal decree converting Saudi Aramco into a joint stock company, a key step allowing it to have more shareholders than its existing one, the Saudi kingdom.However, industry watchers have been increasingly sceptical that the timeline was likely to be kept, with British officials saying recently that the 2018 target would be missed. Doubts have also been fuelled by the lack so far of any prospectus for investors.On Friday, the Saudi energy minister, Khalid al-Falih, appeared to officially confirm a delay. “Most likely it will be in 2019 but we will not know until the announcement has been made,” he told a conference in St Petersburg. “The timing I think will depend on the readiness of the market, rather than the readiness of the company or the readiness of Saudi Arabia,” said Falih, who added that the company was ready.The IPO of Saudi Aramco is a crucial part of the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman’s “Vision 2030”, a plan to ersify the country’s economy away from oil.One sign that London is a frontrunner to host the flotation is that Saudi Aramco has engaged a reputation firm to see what “key stakeholders” think of the firm.On Friday the Saudi-dominated oil cartel Opec and Russia signalled the beginning of the end for their production cuts.Oil prices recently hit $80 a barrel, in part because of the Opec curbs but also because of the US reimposing sanctions on Iran and production falling in crisis-stricken Venezuela. The oil cartel is under pressure from the US, China and India to stabilise prices. Donald Trump said in April: “Opec is at it again.” He tweeted: “Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!” Opec’s secretary general, Mohammad Barkindo, said on Friday that the tweet had sparked a discussion about easing production cuts. “We pride ourselves as friends of the United States,” Barkindo said.Sources told Reuters that Opec and Russia are likely to increase production by about 1 million barrels a day. The news resulted in oil prices falling back to $77.Experts said the market had flipped quickly over the past six months from a world awash in oil to one where there are concerns over supplies.

The latest figures will further stoke concerns over the strength of the UK economy, amid increasing signals for deteriorating growth as Britain prepares to leave the EU next year. Some economists, including officials at the Bank of England, thought the growth rate would be revised higher as more data became available.Threadneedle Street delayed raising interest rates earlier this month after the weak first GDP estimate, despite arguing that the negative hit to the economy from heavy snowfall in late February and early March had probably been overblown. Instead the ONS said it had seen a longer-term pattern of slowing growth in the first three months of the year.Rob Kent-Smith of the ONS said: “Overall, the economy performed poorly in the first quarter, with manufacturing growth slowing and weak consumer-facing services.”While admitting bad weather will have had some impact, particularly for firms in the construction industry and some areas of the retail business, statisticians said the overall effect was limited, with increased online sales and heightened energy production during the cold snap. Much will now hinge on how consumers fare over the coming months, with some early indications there could be a rebound in stronger retail sales data for April.

The conjunction was appropriate because Homebase is not actually closing down. It has been sold, for a pound, to Hilco – the turnaround specialist that rescued the always-on-the-brink-of-collapse music chain stores close, staff are cut, but the brand survives. That was the story with HMV, which continues as a shadow of its former self – smaller, less ambitious, obsessed with signing you up for loyalty schemes and prize draws – and the same will happen to Homebase. Hilco is likely to close 50-plus Homebase stores – a fifth of the total – and 11,000 staff face horrible uncertainty. But unlike the Woolworths fiasco in 20089, when a fantastic brand was trashed and 27,000 jobs lost, it looks like a chunk of the business will fight another day.How much can we read into the travails of Homebase? The takeover of the chain by Australian company Wesfarmers in 2016 is reckoned to be one of the greatest commercial disasters of all time. The Aussies got rid of the old management and brought in their own bosses, but no one seems to have told them about the English weather trying to sell barbecues in Bradford in November was not a smart move.Wesfarmers intended gradually to rebrand Homebase as Bunnings, the name under which its highly successful DIY stores operate in Australia. But it underestimated the strength of the competition in the UK – B\u0026ampQ is the market leader in home improvement – and made a major error in getting rid of in-store concessions such as Laura Ashley and Habitat, switching the emphasis from home furnishings to hardcore DIY.These mistakes were probably enough to sink the new enterprise on its own – Wesfarmers will be left with a £1bn-plus bill as it retreats to sun-soaked, barbecue-buying, fence-erecting Australia. But throw in the difficulties faced by UK retailers generally, the fact that the housing market has stalled, the home improvement sector is weak and consumer confidence low, and top all that up with the nightmare of Brexit – where the uncertainty now looks as if it will continue until at least 2023 – and you have a recipe for disaster.I won’t mourn Homebase in the way I did Woolworths, which I was sure could have been turned around by new management, or Maplin, which was a genuinely useful store staffed by people who actually knew about the stuff they were selling. Churn is the way of the world in retail. But the seemingly endless series of closures and profit warnings does suggest that fundamental change is underway. Mothercare, Toys R Us, Carpetright, New Look, East, Warren Evans, Multiyork, even M\u0026ampS have all been caught up in the disruption.The fact that fewer people in their 20s are buying houses, that a large proportion of this group are likely to end up lifelong renters, and that we are turning away more generally from the ownership of stuff, (with the possible exception of supersized television sets) has vast implications for our beleaguered high streets, and the way we order our lives.An old guy like me still enjoys buying CDs in HMV, but I am one of a dwindling number. The Homebase horror show may have been largely self-inflicted, but it’s a fair bet that other famous brands are about to get burned on the barbecue of high-tech, travel-light living.• Stephen Moss is a feature writer at the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f787dc48daa8313b0b51c85d01b3693d91ca1a60/0_9_640_384/master/640.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7628f2064d84054a6e18e8a7ea11048e","title":"britain politeness english speakers gratitude","story":"In 2015, Simeon Floyd, then of the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, gave a lecture in Antwerp about expressions of gratitude in eight cultures around the world. I was lucky enough to be there, and have been thinking ever since about the videos he showed. In one, a Cha’palaa speaker in Ecuador goes to a hole-in-the-wall shop and asks for some cooking oil. Receiving it, he turns away and leaves. In another, a British student eyes up another’s biscuits and asks for one. As he reaches into the proffered packet, he smiles and says, “Sweet!”This week, Royal Society Open Science published Floyd and his colleagues’ work, and caused a flutter. The Times headlined its piece “Britons really do say ‘thank you’ more than anyone else”. The Independent referred to Britain’s famed “unrelenting penchant for\u0026nbsppoliteness”.If Britain is famed anywhere for “unrelenting politeness”, it is nowhere more so than in Britain itself, where the national reputation for good manners is treated as a badge of honour. While there’s plenty of British self-deprecation in the use of words like “please”, “thank you” and “sorry”, it comes with some implicit self-congratulation: we use these words because we’re so polite, the reasoning goes. The unspoken assumption is that others are less so.Some humility (not the same as self-deprecation or politeness) might be in order here, since the research does not show that the British thank “more than anyone else”, but that they thank more (in certain situations) than seven other cultures. Whether British English speakers thank more than people in China, Japan, India or the Middle East is yet unknown – and whether the British thank more than other English speakers is yet another matter. Research for the Longman Grammar of Spoken and Written English, for instance, found that Americans say “thanks” or “thank you” twice as much in conversation as Britons, while Britons say “please” twice as much as Americans.That doesn’t mean Britons make politer requests or that Americans are more grateful. It means that we’ve acquired different habits. With Rachele De Felice of University College London, I’ve been trying to dig down into those numbers. If “thank you” is used at different rates in two cultures, it probably means different things to those cultures. Indeed, in our studies of British and American email correspondence, we’ve found that Britons are more apt to begin emails with thanks for the previous message, while Americans are more likely to thank people for their time or interest. We’ve also found that the lesser American use of “please” is offset by more expressions of appreciation in making requests.British “thanks” comes into its own at the shop till. I was inducted into this thanking culture in the early 2000s, when I was a fresh immigrant from the US, and volunteered in a Brighton charity shop. There, to my surprise, I learned that English shop assistants and patrons can begin an interaction with “thank you” the customer who places a box of Christmas cards in front of the shop assistant can use “thank you” to indicate that they are ready to start a transaction. The assistant may then say “thank you” as they take the item to ring up. Before the end of the interaction, what with the back-and-forth of credit cards or cash, pin machines or change, receipts and bagged goods, there may well be half a dozen more thanks. Do these thanks show gratitude? An alternative reading (made in the 1970s by sociolinguist Dell Hymes) is that the British “thank you” sometimes means “I am asking you to take the next turn in this interaction” or “I am accepting that it is my turn to do something in this interaction”.When we visit other cultures that don’t use thanking to manage their interactions in the same way, it can feel off-putting. But to conclude from ample “thanks”-giving that “we’re more polite” is only to conclude that “we do the things we consider polite more often than other cultures do the things we consider polite”. Hardly a surprising finding.The prevalence of thanks in English-speaking cultures doesn’t show we care more about others and the impositions we make on them. It may instead be a side-effect of our culture’s inidualism. I have to thank you because I cannot assume that we’re close enough for you to naturally be generous towards me. In a more intimate situation or collectivist culture, expressing “thanks” can imply “I\u0026nbsphadn’t trusted that I could count on you for that.”Anyway, thanks for reading.• Lynne Murphy is professor of linguistics at the University of Sussex and author of The Prodigal Tongue: the Love-Hate Relationship between British and American English"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/44a907a988a05425d55a38143918e713ec961fe3/0_32_3336_2002/master/3336.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4c957faf85581e90700b82cd4b7e43e","title":"senior epa officials collaborated with climate change denial group emails show","story":"Newly released emails show senior officials from the Environmental Protection Agency worked closely with conservative thinktank the Heartland InstituteNewly released emails show senior Environmental Protection Agency officials working closely with a conservative group that dismisses climate change to rally like-minded people for public hearings on science and global warming, counter negative news coverage and tout Scott Pruitt’s stewardship of the agency.John Konkus, EPA’s deputy associate administrator for public affairs, repeatedly reached out to senior staffers at the Heartland Institute, according to the emails.“If you send a list, we will make sure an invitation is sent,” Konkus wrote to the then Heartland president, Joseph Bast, in May 2017, seeking suggestions on scientists and economists the EPA could invite to an annual EPA public hearing on the agency’s science standards.Follow-up emails show Konkus and the Heartland Institute mustering scores of potential invitees known for rejecting scientific warnings of human-caused climate change, including from groups such as Plants Need CO2, The Right Climate Stuff and Junk Science.The emails underscore how Pruitt and senior agency officials have sought to surround themselves with people who share their vision of curbing environmental regulation and enforcement, leading to complaints from environmentalists that he is ignoring the conclusions of the majority of scientists in and out of his agency, especially when it comes to climate-changing carbon emissions.They were obtained by the Environmental Defence Fund and the Southern Environmental Law Centre, which sued to enforce a Freedom of Information request. The EPA maintains close working relationships with a broad range of public and private groups, and Heartland is just one of many the agency engages with “to ensure the public is informed”, said the EPA spokesman Lincoln Ferguson.“It demonstrates the agency’s dedication to advancing President Trump’s agenda of environmental stewardship and regulatory certainty,” he said.The public hearing referred to in the May 2017 email was cancelled when the EPA official who runs it fell ill, the EPA said.But Bast contended in an email sent to EPA staffers and others that the official called off the hearing after learning that climate change “sceptics planned to attend”.The Heartland Institute calls itself a leading free market thinktank. It rejects decades of science saying fossil-fuel emissions are altering the climate and says on its website that curbing use of petroleum and coal to fight climate change would “squander one of America’s greatest comparative advantages among the world’s nations”.“Of course The Heartland Institute has been working with EPA on policy and personnel decisions,” Tim Huelskamp, a former Kansas Republican congressman who now leads the group, said in a statement. “They recognised us as the pre-eminent organisation opposing the radical climate alarmism agenda and instead promoting sound science and policy,” Huelskamp wrote.He said Heartland would continue to help Pruitt and his staff.Ferguson said Pruitt and his top officials had also met with groups known for their campaigns against climate-changing emissions and pollutants from fossil fuels, including the Moms Clean Air Force, the American Lung Association, and others.But Ben Levitan of the Environmental Defence Fund said mainstream climate-change groups have received nothing like the outreach and invitations that Heartland and other hard-right groups have been getting.Certainly, “in some ways this is normal and in the course of business that ebbs and flows with the ideology of the administration in power”, said Meredith McGehee, executive director of Issue One, a not-for-profit group promoting ethical government and bipartisan political reform.An email last February shows Bast forwarded to followers an email with the line “From the White House”, rallying activists to public hearings the EPA was then holding around the country on repealing an Obama-era power plan meant to curb fossil-fuel emissions.The email is signed by a Pruitt political appointee and gives the name of another EPA official for activists to call. It’s not clear from the email, however, who initiated the attempt to rally conservatives for the public hearing.The Washington Post reported in September that Konkus had been scrutinising grant applications for mentions of climate change, which he reportedly calls “the double C-word”.Emails show he and former EPA spokeswoman, Liz Bowman, repeatedly reached out to Heartland to talk over critical coverage by the Post.And an email from Bast, shared with EPA staffers and others, shows the then-Heartland president celebrating news that a reporter, Justin Gillis, was leaving the New York Times.“Ding Dong, the Witch is Dead. Still waiting for Chris Mooney and Juliet Eilperin at the WaPo and Seth Borenstein at AP to flame out,” Bast writes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/233f1ec684e15247b26a82bcf183d0443069fa60/0_0_5508_3305/master/5508.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=188d236bbeb75e48c918d5a2562747a1","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"Wild horses, an Ethiopian wolf and a dolphin attacking a porpoise are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c4d9cce9d5e157a478922bc3a3306d27ea5e99c/0_253_5517_3310/master/5517.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1559d836782fd67b4ddc00b7bc1fbbf","title":"dior gallops back into the spotlight with a mexican rodeo","story":"Maria Grazia Chiuri seeks to boost Dior’s feminist credentials with a collection inspired by daredevil womenFor the second week in a row, a venerable French fashion house has taken the reins of high fashion.After last weekend’s surprise of a Givenchy royal wedding dress, Christian Dior on Thursday recreated a Mexican rodeo in a French chateau near Paris, at a catwalk show for 725 guests. The Dior muses for this season’s cruise collection are the escaramuzas, female riders who compete in the male-dominated rodeos, performing daredevil manoeuvres at breakneck speed while riding sidesaddle. Eight of them, their Christian Dior emblazoned belts matched to their wide-brimmed hats, opened the show performing with their horses.Glowering clouds broke into a thunderstorm as the show opened, sending models on to a catwalk slick with driving rain. Fortunately, the tough attitude of the collection had been translated into an all-flat-shoe policy, and was adopted by models who winked at the audience while their sodden ponytails flicked water as they walked. “Life is a rodeo,” said creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri. “You have to learn to stay in the saddle.” “Usually, the female role in rodeo culture is to be there to support their husbands and sons, but these women have decided they wanted to do it themselves,” the designer said before the show. “But they do it in traditional dress, because they don’t want to give up their femininity. Women are always being made to feel they have to change who they are to fit in. This collection speaks about that.”The gorgeously attired expert equestriennes who opened this show represented Dior bringing in the cavalry. This was a moment to reassert its identity as the most feminist fashion house. With Givenchy creating the wedding dress for the first self-proclaimed feminist princess, Dior must now remind consumers that Chiuri, who became Dior’s first female creative director in 2016, has overhauled a house that once stood for demure, seen-but-not-heard femininity and redefined it as fashion week’s most woke brand. Chiuri’s first Dior show featured a “We should all be feminists” slogan T-shirt that became a cult hit, while the message “Women’s rights are human rights” featured on the backdrop for her most recent show in Paris.“This collection is very Mr Dior – very soft,” said Chiuri. “The point is that you don’t have to renounce your femininity.” Dressed in a black silk blouse and dark jeans, the designer said she had been talking to her recently graduated daughter about dressing for the workplace. “I would like that she would feel she can be herself,” she said.“I speak about women, because that’s what I know about,” Chiuri said of the messaging of her collection. “And I work with female photographers from all over the world, because I want to include their points of view. I believe in the idea of a community of women.”The strategy of Chiuri’s Dior is based on making female empowerment look glamorous. Enter, then, the escaramuzas, who do battle in the adrenaline-charged rodeos wearing ornate costumes that celebrate both their femininity and their sportsmanship. The sport requires nerves of steel and the escaramuza aesthetic is drawn directly from the uniforms worn by the Adelitas, female soldiers who fought in the Mexican revolution. The ornate traditional embroidery is all done by hand, and the finished costumes so multilayered that dressing for a competition can take two hours.This translated on the catwalk as ample-skirted gowns with high, tight waists accentuated by leather belts or by Dior’s emblematic Bar jacket, with its exaggerated hip curve. Black gowns glinted with silver metallic trim white dresses were toughened up with wide black belts. Toile de Jouy fabrics, beloved in traditional French interior design, featured tigers and serpents rather than bluebirds and teacups. Chantilly, the location of the chateau that hosted the show, was referenced in flounced and pleated lace."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2df4818ca6aa2b20ba7d03fb76d70d5c4e001595/0_337_6582_3949/master/6582.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=327d159d0ba1c148f1e98a5c8ce5e6fa","title":"bonnie wright from harry potter to a menopause movie","story":"Playing Ginny Weasley aged nine was Wright’s first job. Now in her late 20s, she talks about directing her Potter peers and her new AS Byatt AdaptationAn unassuming hairdressing salon in a shopping precinct in Lincoln is an unlikely venue for the world premiere of a film directed by a globally famous actor. But behind a velvet rope, between the washbasins, that is exactly what is happening in Sincil Salon in Sincil Street in Lincoln town centre. The film is called Medusa’s Ankles, and the director is Bonnie Wright – better known to tens of millions as Ginny Weasley in the Harry Potter film series.The venue, in fact, is wholly appropriate: Medusa’s Ankles, adapted from a short story by AS Byatt, is set entirely in a hairdresser’s. It stars Kerry Fox as a woman disconcerted by the signs of ageing – particularly her greying hair, which she is determined to keep “natural” – and Jason Isaacs as a charismatic, bullying hairdresser with whom she has a fraught, fractious relationship. The 20-minute film is showing over three days in the salon, which will be open for normal hairdressing operation throughout.“What’s so great about this,” says Wright, “is that we spend so much time experiencing things on the internet and social media that an actual physical film screening is rare.” Wright also says she likes the “exhibition-y” feel of the event, which appears as much a gallery installation as a cinema premiere. The screening has been organised by Lincoln-based Mansions of the Future, a three-year cultural project designed to “allow the public to collaborate directly with artists” future events include a new production with nonprofessional actors of Steven Berkoff’s 2001 play Ritual in Blood, about the medieval “blood libel” surrounding Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln. Wright very much approves of Mansions of the Future’s aim to bring culture to the people: “I was very lucky to have grown up in London and had that access to the arts. The way I got into this was through culture and education, and it’s so important to take it outside of the capital city.”Wright, 27, bears little resemblance to the pale-faced schoolgirl we last saw settling down to raise a family with Harry Potter (after helping to see off Voldemort’s army at the climactic Battle of Hogwarts). Since finishing the series eight years ago in 2010, she has opted to develop a career largely behind the camera, directing short films, shooting music videos and art projects and recently branching out into commercials. Unlike her fellow Potter alumni, Wright has taken only a few acting jobs since, opting instead to study film-making at the London College of Communication and setting up her own production company in 2012.Medusa’s Ankles has an unlikely subject for a film-maker in her late 20s: a woman experiencing a menopausal midlife crisis. “It’s something I am obviously yet to experience!” she says. “But I think I and a lot of people can understand it: we’ve all sat in a hair salon and been at the mercy of someone else’s opinion. Sometimes you go in knowing exactly what you want, other times it’s about what they think you should have. The story – and the film – is about that sensory interaction, that heightened space between the hairdresser and their client.”The film, she says, is also partly intended as a showcase for how she can handle larger sets and complex lighting setups (“It’s definitely strategic”), and she has her sights set on a full-length feature film. Wright is a committed activist for environmental causes, and is working on a script that, she says, is “heavily inspired by the work I’ve been doing with Greenpeace around ocean plastics, but with a mythological and science fiction twist”.Wright is keen to show she has moved on from Potter, but acknowledges the debt she owes to the role she secured as a nine-year-old after her older brother Lewis suggested she go along to an open casting call. “At the beginning I was in complete awe of whole thing,” she says. “All of us were pretty much learning about film-making and acting as it was happening. It was only as the films developed and the characters became more complex that it became more like a job. Looking back, what I loved about those films is that everyone, from the cinematographer to the set designer, were at the top of their field. To watch people for whom the craft of film-making was so important – that stayed with me.”She also credits the Potter films for pushing her towards writing and directing: “Doing such big films gave me a desire to get more out of film-making, to get deeper into the process. When you are acting you are observing so much happening around you. I am directing actors having been directed myself, and there is specific type of language you have that is so unique. If you’ve been on the other side of it, it’s such a lovely experience.”Wright has not been shy about putting her industry contacts to good use. Her graduation film, a 10-minute drama about a small girl who befriends a bereaved older man, featured David Thewlis, who played Remus Lupin in the Potter films and the star of her second film, a poetic piece about a young man dealing with the death of a lover, was Christian Coulson, who played the teenage Tom Riddle in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. Isaacs, in her new film, is another Potter regular, having played Lucius Malfoy in six of the films.“For sure, I have an advantage in terms of the access to these people,” she says, “as well as to the experiences I’ve had along the way. But respecting that is really important. If you are going to call upon actors or connections, it’s important not to utilise them when they are not needed. Only if the actor would be right for the role, rather than choosing them for the sake of it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80fb149d7ea51250606826c36d36c45097e3918c/368_193_5104_3062/master/5104.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=620f519612bc82cd7a5bd20321046c64","title":"liverpool relish final test topple real madrid kings of europe","story":"Eventually, the talking stops. Jürgen Klopp and his players have done all the interviews. They have been through all the tactics and there will come a time on Saturday evening, in the bowels of the NSC Olimpiyskiy, when they will be in their dressing room, fighting their nerves and, as Klopp acknowledged, those are the moments when Real Madrid’s experience will count in favour of the 12-times champions.Liverpool’s opponents will be trying to emulate the great Ajax and Bayern Munich sides of the 1970s by winning this competition three seasons in a row, bringing their number of triumphs to 13 in total. Madrid, in Klopp’s words, “work like a clock from Switzerland” and, no matter how Liverpool have prepared for Cristiano Ronaldo, the lesson of history shows the five-times Ballon d’Or winner usually manages to leave his mark on these occasions.It also shows that Liverpool have conceded the first goal in their last three European Cup finals and, going back to that famous night in Istanbul 13 years ago, that they were behind inside the opening 60 seconds against Milan. The free-kick Djimi Traoré gave away in the buildup to Paolo Maldini’s goal was put down to stage fright on the part of the Liverpool defender. Yet it did not need long in Klopp’s company to realise he thinks the current team have too much in their favour to allow nerves to take over.“I am pretty sure in the second before the game that Real Madrid will be more confident than we are,” Klopp said, “but that is not a problem because the game doesn’t end in that second, it only starts. We’ve had two weeks to prepare and analyse. I’ve looked at the teams they have played – and they have played really strong teams. But they never played us and we are Liverpool. Not only are we a really good football team but this club has in its DNA to go for the big things. We are Liverpool. Nobody expected us to be here but we are here because we are Liverpool.Klopp is entitled to speak confidently when his side have accumulated 46 goals, if qualifiers are counted, in this season’s competition, beating the record Barcelona set with 45 in the 1999-2000 season. Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané have managed 31 between them and, in all competitions, that trio have scored 90 times. Salah alone has 44. Of course Klopp should be optimistic if his team can find the right balance between attack and defence, eliminate the mistakes that helped Roma in the semi-finals and hope that Loris Karius, their erratic goalkeeper, has an accident-free night.If they can manage all that, it is perfectly plausible Jordan Henderson can follow Emlyn Hughes (1977 and 1978), Phil Thompson (1981), Graeme Souness (1984) and Steven Gerrard (2005) by lifting the trophy.Madrid, after all, conceded 44 goals in La Liga last season and, to put that into context, it was more than Getafe in eighth position or 11th-placed Eyol let in. That, however, does not change the fact that Zinedine Zidane’s team are always formidable opponents on the big nights or that even in this record-breaking season for Salah there is still one player, Ronaldo, who is outscoring him, 15-11, in this\u0026nbspcompetition.Last season Ronaldo scored twice for Madrid when they beat Juventus 4-1 in the final. In 2016, when the opposition in the final were Atlético Madrid, his was the decisive kick in the shootout. As for 2014, facing Atlético at the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Ronaldo scored again from 12 yards and la Décima was confirmed. And 2018? Nobody would be surprised if Ronaldo has his top off, flexing his pecs for the cameras, if Liverpool defend as obligingly as they did in the Europa League final against\u0026nbspSevilla two years ago. Or, thinking back to their performance in the Stadio Olimpico a few weeks ago, the second leg of their semi-final against Roma.Should that happen, Zidane will leave the group of 18 managers, including Brian Clough, Sir Alex Ferguson, José Mourinho and Pep Guardiola, who have won this competition twice and move alongside Carlo Ancelotti and Bob Paisley as a three-times winner. Except Zidane will have done it in less time than anybody. Which probably explains why Klopp was so nonplussed when it was put to him Zidane was not renowned for his tactical knowledge.“If a lot of people think Zinedine Zidane has not a lot of tactical knowledge and then people think the same about me that would be really funny,” Klopp said. “The two managers in the Champions League final have no clue about tactics? What would that say about the game?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86508a3918e54e5bb76645108da07e81a944accc/99_621_6164_3698/master/6164.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=34da8cd5f66ee7af3a925a1c545c087d","title":"found out aunt uncle are my real parents experience","story":"I felt shock at first.

I thought she was going to tell me somebody was dying. Instead, she revealed that she was not my biological mother. Her brother, one of my many uncles, a man I’d never met, who lived in northern Greece, was my real father. I slumped against the wall in shock. By the end, I was splayed on the floor.I’d always known my parents, who had settled in Canberra, Australia, struggled to have children. They’d tried for 17 years and had three miscarriages. When Mum had to go back to Greece in 1973 to visit her sick father, Dad said, “Why don’t you see if you can get a baby from an orphanage in Thessaloniki?” But it didn’t work out. My uncle must have seen how sad she was. He proposed that he and his wife have a baby for her. They already had two sons, George and Billy, who were 10 and 11, and said their child-rearing years were behind them.It was to be a pure gift, but Mum was scared her brother and his wife might want to keep the child: there was nothing in writing. Still, she agreed, went back to Australia and waited. One day, she got a letter. It said: “We’re pregnant. The baby will be born in June 1974.” She flew back early, but missed the birth by a day or two.Mum spent five months in Greece, looking after me and doing the paperwork. My birth certificate was issued with my adoptive name and listed my adoptive parents as my parents. We left for Australia when I was six months old. It must have been difficult for my biological parents to give me up. George later told me that when I was taken away, it was like a period of mourning – nobody talked for three days.After that, we just got on with life. I had a happy childhood, but always felt conspicuous – as the only Greek child at school, and with no siblings. But I was everything to my parents and I looked enough like them not to question it.Mum said they’d been waiting until I finished my degree to tell me they didn’t want to derail my studies. When I said I was going to do a PhD, they didn’t want four more years with the burden of that secret. It was causing them sleepless nights. They were scared they’d die and I’d never know the truth. Dad left it to Mum to tell me as it was her side of the family he wasn’t one for talking much.Mum became teary as she told me, but by the end she seemed lighter. She was glad I’d found out from her. I felt shock at first. This woman suddenly wasn’t Mum any more. Then I felt deceived and angry. But after that came excitement that I had brothers. I wanted to call up all my old friends and tell them: “Remember that kid you went to school with who had no siblings? I’ve suddenly got two!”My biological mother had died in 1993. My mum felt guilty that she’d denied me the chance to meet her. I wondered at the time why her sister-in-law’s death affected her so much, but now it made sense. My biological father was still alive when I discovered the truth, but he died two years later, before I had a chance to meet him. I question why I didn’t travel to see him straight away, but I wasn’t in a hurry to do it. In truth, I didn’t want to get to know another set of parents.When I finally went to Greece in 2003 to meet my brothers, I told Mum she had to come with me. She’d been the architect of this, so she had to be there when we were finally reunited. It was wonderful to meet them, and we have a great relationship now. They’d always known I existed, but had to respect the family’s wishes. Now we Skype regularly and, as neither of them has their own children, they are delighted to get to know my sons. And all those years learning Greek, at Mum’s insistence, paid off, as I can speak to them.I forgave my parents quickly. At the end of the day, they’d always loved me. My wife and I struggled to conceive for two years, and that was tough. Mum and Dad had close to 18 years of that. My dad has since died, but he taught me so much, including how to be a father. My mum adores my boys. I’ll tell them one day: “Without that lady and the lengths she went to to become a mother, I wouldn’t be here and neither would you.”• As told to Sophie Haydock.

Her hair was dark brown and styled in a neat bob. An uncharitable person might have described her as dowdy. Her GP’s referral letter summarised the key facts of her case, which contained the essential elements of a tragic love story: emotional extremity, reckless abandon, passion and desire.After a few introductory remarks about my role as a psychotherapist, I explained that I wanted to hear her version of events.“It’s difficult,” she said. “I can tell you what happened, but it’s so difficult to express how it feels.”“Just take your time,” I replied.Megan had been married for 20 years. Her husband, Philip, was an accountant and they had always been happy. “We don’t have any children,” she volunteered. “It was just never the right time.”Two years before she came to me, Megan had consulted a dentist who specialised in complicated extractions. “I thought he was quite handsome. He had a pleasant manner. But…” She shook her head. “These things are so hard to describe. Perhaps I felt something – right at the beginning. I just wasn’t sure what was happening.”The dentist, Daman Verma (not his real name), performed the operation. Everything went to plan. But when the general anaesthetic wore off and Megan woke up, she felt different. “I opened my eyes and looked up at a light on the ceiling and I remember thinking: I’ve got to see him. I didn’t want to know how the operation had gone.”“Did you want to say something to him?”“No, I just wanted to see him.”“Yes, but why?” I pressed her for a more precise answer but she was either unwilling or unable to give me one.Verma was called by the nurses. He held Megan’s hand and said something – probably words of reassurance. She couldn’t remember, because she wasn’t really listening. She had become entirely absorbed by his face, which struck her as being unnaturally beautiful, and she discovered in his eyes something so extraordinary, it almost made her gasp: reciprocation. He wanted her as much as she wanted him. When he tried to move away, she gripped his hand a little tighter. He looked embarrassed. Of course: he couldn’t show his feelings, not in front of the nurses. He was a professional. She was mildly amused by his clumsy attempts to conceal the truth. She released his fingers, knowing, with absolute certainty, that the love they felt for each other was so strong they would spend the rest of their lives together.I have often found myself sitting in front of lovesick patients, whose psychological pain and behavioural disturbances are equal in severity to any of the symptoms of a major psychiatric illness. Such patients are usually embarrassed to disclose their thoughts lovesickness is supposedly transitory, adolescent, inconsequential or ridiculous.This couldn’t be further from the truth. The emotional and behavioural consequences of falling in love can be enduring and profound. I have treated an Oxford graduate who refused to move on when his girlfriend of four months ended their relationship, paying her unwelcome visits and following her car to try to convince her of their love. Then there was Mavis, a recently bereaved housewife in her early 70s who was struggling to cope without her husband – because she missed the sex their marriage, it transpired, had been based entirely on physical intimacy. Another patient, a successful businessman, loved his wife, yet risked his livelihood on 3,000 prostitutes – not because he was addicted to sex, but to courtship.Unrequited love is a frequent cause of suicide (particularly among the young). There is a view that intermittently gains currency within psychiatry and psychology that troubled close relationships are not merely associated with mental illness, but are a primary cause.Is it possible to fall so deeply in love, so quickly? We make judgments about attractiveness in a matter of milliseconds. We assume that beautiful people are more likable, friendly and interesting, something psychologists call the halo effect. But Megan had experienced something much more profound, and her insistence that her feelings were reciprocated was particularly unusual.“How did you know that he had fallen in love with you?” I asked her.“I just knew.”I paused to consider how I might best negotiate this impasse. “Why is it,” I asked, “that we believe some things and not others?”“Because we have reasons…”“So what were your reasons?”“I could see it in his eyes.”“What could you see?”“His need. You can see things in people’s eyes, can’t you?”Defensiveness had made her voice brittle.I asked if it was possible that she might have misinterpreted his expression.“What I saw was more meaningful. They say there’s a look – you know? – the look of love.”When people talk about the look of love, they are referring to something that scientists call the copulatory gaze: the eyes lock for several seconds before one party looks away. It occurs when prospective lovers first encounter each other – an intense stare that usually signals sexual interest. Apes do much the same thing.After her operation, Megan obsessed about Verma. Her sleep was disturbed and she couldn’t concentrate at work. She yearned to be near him.“Was the attraction sexual?”“No,” she protested. Then she sighed. “Well, yes, but it was only a small part. If it had been possible for us to be together, and the physical side hadn’t happened, that wouldn’t have mattered.”Her husband noticed that her mood was deteriorating. He tried talking to her, but she was distant and withdrawn. Weeks passed. Megan telephoned Verma. “It was an awkward conversation. I gave him a chance to tell me how he felt, but he was obviously scared. The experience had been too overwhelming.”“What did you talk about?”“My recovery – how it was going. Eventually, I had to say something more direct. I suggested that we meet up for a coffee, to discuss what we were going to do.”“And how did he respond?”“He pretended he didn’t understand. I persevered, but he was evasive. He made some excuse and hung up.”Megan phoned Verma repeatedly, sometimes several times a day. The dental secretaries asked her to stop. She tracked down his home number. When his wife, Angee, picked up the phone, Megan did her best to explain the situation as sympathetically as she could – because that’s what Daman would have wanted – but Angee became irritable.“She told me to get help.”“What did you think of that?”“So you could see how your behaviour might have looked to others?”“Mad, you mean?”“I didn’t say that.” But that’s exactly what I meant.“Yes,” she nodded.“Didn’t that make you pause to reconsider what you were doing?”“It wasn’t important to me what other people thought.”Megan wrote long, detailed letters to Verma every day suggesting solutions, begging him to recognise that their love could not be denied. Neither of them was to blame, how could they be? But it was wrong to deceive Philip and Angee, to perpetuate a lie. “I waited outside his practice, for hours. And when he came out, I ran over to him.”“He didn’t want to talk. I told him I understood, that maybe he needed more time. But in the end I said to him, you’re going to have to accept that this is real.”Verma contacted Megan’s GP, who contacted Megan’s husband.“He wasn’t very happy.”What made Megan so interesting was her ordinariness. She had previously suffered from mild depression, but there was nothing about her life or history that offered the slightest indication of what was to follow. She was proof that, as far as mental health is concerned, we all walk a tightrope it doesn’t take very much to make us lose balance and fall.Megan’s husband, Philip, was upset, but tried to be understanding. “He told me he loved me, and said he’d always be there for me,” she said. “It was sad.”“Because you didn’t love him any more?”Megan looked at me aghast. “No. I’ve always loved Phil. It’s just what I feel for Daman – it’s something higher.”“Maybe. It’s stronger, deeper, like something that was meant to be.”Megan had been taken by her husband to see a psychiatrist who put her on Pimozide, an antipsychotic drug that reduces delusional thinking. When the drug had no effect, the dose was increased but Megan’s longing seemed to increase. She waited outside Verma’s practice more often. Sometimes, he would send his secretary out with a message: go home. Megan didn’t argue.One afternoon, she followed him home and stood beneath a lamp-post opposite his front door. Verma stormed out of his house and confronted Megan, threatening to call the police. “He was pretending, for his wife’s sake. Really, in his heart, he wanted me to be there.” Whenever Megan was ordered to go home, she did, but by this time her behaviour was making everyone nervous. The Vermas had two young children and Angee was worried about their safety. Verma never called the police, recognising that Megan was ill, but his wife was less understanding.After 18 months, Verma opted for a radical solution: he applied for a job in Dubai. It was something the couple had discussed before but Megan’s harassment made the decision much easier.Verma and his family had been living in Dubai for six months by the time Megan was referred to me. She was no longer under the care of a psychiatrist, and her GP believed she was much improved. Nevertheless, he thought it would be helpful if she was given the opportunity to talk about her experiences with a psychotherapist: she had been traumatised and, like most trauma victims, she would make a better adjustment if she could make sense of her history. But the more I talked to Megan, the more I suspected that she wasn’t much improved at all. She’d simply become better at hiding her pain.“Yes. I miss him a lot.” Megan was studying her hands. “I often think about what he’s doing. You know, in Dubai… I think of him waking up and getting out of bed, brushing his teeth and going to work. I like to be on my own in the early evening, because I know that, in Dubai, he’s just gone to bed. It’s then I feel most that I can reach out to him.”A delusion is a rigidly held belief that is maintained even when there is no evidence to support it however, what constitutes good evidence differs from person to person. Megan regarded her own feelings as acceptable evidence: Verma was in love with her.The next time I saw her, she looked more tired than usual. “I wish I could talk to him on the phone,” she admitted.“Have you tried to get his number?”“I’ve thought about it, but no.”“Have you thought about following him to the Middle East?”“Yes,” she said. She sighed, her eyes glistening. “I know… I know.” That’s all she said. I can still recreate the sound in my mind: hesitant, slightly hoarse, full of sadness and resignation. Her grief was palpable. She had finally allowed herself to contemplate the possibility that Verma didn’t love her, that they would never be together.Falling in love is painful. Most of us know what it’s like – the desperation, the longing. And when we aren’t loved in return, the anguish can be unbearable. Megan believed she had found the love of her life. The distress that most of us might have to tolerate for months or years, she was going to have to tolerate for the rest of her life.“It’s so unfair,” Megan whispered.The tears tumbled down her cheeks. I was humbled by the sheer magnitude of her agony.What are the causes of De Clérambault’s syndrome? The most accurate and honest answer is also probably the least satisfactory. No one really knows. It has been attributed to neurotransmitter imbalances, but the medication employed to correct those imbalances is rarely effective. Dopamine might have a role to play, but Megan’s medication, which worked by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain, had no effect. Most patients report a dulling of emotion, but the underlying fixation persists. Another possibility is abnormal electrical activity in the temporal lobes. De Clérambault’s syndrome and temporal lobe epilepsy share some common features: intensification of emotions, altered sexual interest and transcendent episodes.The syndrome is difficult to treat, and usually has a chronic course. A combination of medication and enforced separation is supposed to be the most effective treatment, but Megan had taken Pimozide and not seen Verma for six months, and still yearned to be with him.The reality of psychotherapy is that it is messy, and rarely progresses along satisfying lines. The pieces of Megan’s puzzle didn’t fit together neatly. A staunch biological psychiatrist would probably suggest that this is because De Clérambault’s syndrome is a psychotic illness and best explained by chemical imbalances in the brain. The fact that Megan’s medication didn’t work doesn’t compromise this argument. Perhaps we just need better drugs.I can’t offer a psychological explanation, but I can offer a kind of contextualisation. Megan was experiencing the same things that we all experience when we are smitten, only greatly magnified. Even her delusional thinking was, in a sense, normal, because romantic love is often very irrational – love at first sight and ascribing chance meetings to destiny are commonplace. Most love-struck iniduals engage in subtle forms of stalking – for example, loitering in places where they are likely to encounter the person they’ve fallen in love with. The only feature of Megan’s illness that marked a qualitative departure from normality was her absolute conviction that Verma was also smitten. Other than this delusion of reciprocity, Megan’s psychopathological love was simply romantic love writ large: not abnormal, as such, but supernormal.One day, I asked Megan if she thought we were making any progress. “Yes,” she said. “It’s helpful… talking.”I flattered myself that we were getting somewhere. But I was very much mistaken.I asked to see Megan’s husband, Philip. We talked a little about the nature of his relationship with Megan and how things had changed for the better since Verma moved to Dubai. “I don’t have to worry about where she is, or what she’s doing,” he told me. “She’s back at work now and she comes straight home. On the face of it, it’s like everything’s normal again. We chat, go to the cinema, go for walks.”“Are you still… intimate?”“Yes.” He suddenly looked bewildered, boyish. “Nothing’s changed – but everything’s different. It’s her, but not her. I know she’s thinking about him all the time. She’s probably even thinking about him when we’re in bed.”“You think she’s having sexual fantasies about him while you’re…”Philip cut in. “No, no.” He took a deep breath, “Well, I can’t say for sure, of course. Maybe she does think of him while we’re making love.” Philip believed that Megan’s feelings for Verma had become more elevated. “Has Megan told you about her… I don’t know what to call it, really. I suppose it’s like a shrine.”“What?” I sat up, surprised.He told me Megan had a box in her bedroom containing things that had some connection with Verma: a newspaper clipping of him at a fundraising event, his old business card, a pamphlet that she picked up at his clinic and her appointment letters.“What does she do with these things?”“She takes them out from time to time. She used to sit next to the box and close her eyes. It was as though she was praying.”Did I help Megan? In the end there was no cure, but she did come to accept that she would have to live her life without Verma and, to the best of my knowledge, never attempted to follow him to Dubai. She still loved him – and would love him for ever.Names and details have been changed• This is an edited extract from The Incurable Romantic – And Other Unsettling Revelations, by Frank Tallis, published on 7 June by Little Brown at £18.99.

Martin Parr, she has realised, has invaded one of the most prestigious flower shows in the world.“It does happen that somebody recognises me, but not often – and certainly not at Chelsea,” Parr says. “It happens if I go to London openings, but these people on the whole don’t go to exhibitions, they just like plants, they only go to gardens.“I’m always interested in people and Chelsea is heaving with a certain type: rock-solid middle England, middle-aged, middle-class, grey hair, grey pound – still a very important part of the constituency. It’s as white as it gets: I think the only ethnic minority people I met were stewarding or working in the shops.”Anyone who does recognise Parr might worry they are about to be gently mocked in searing colour, like his scorched ice-cream eaters on pebbly beaches, or his silent couples perched glumly at cafe tables.He can barely tell a dandelion from an orchid, but he loves Chelsea, where every hat bears more flowers than any show garden, every recklessly patterned shirt is stretched over a post-prandial stomach.“Oh, I do love Chelsea,” he says. “I love anywhere where there are people. That’s my only dread, that there won’t be enough people, and you don’t have to worry about that at Chelsea. The only problem is that there are just so many of them, you have to fight your way through the crowds.”Parr has been accused in the past of artificially tweaking the colours in his images: “Another urban myth about me, not true.” But that’s not a problem at Chelsea – it bursts with colour.Having captured a man in crimson trousers intently studying some Wedgwood china that matches his floral shirt, Parr positions himself by a violently pink rose.“I thought it would be fun to do a sequence of people smelling the same rose, and I knew this was the one. It had the maximum smell in appearance and the minimum in results – that accounts for the expression of disappointment on so many of the faces.”Many people have given up even pretending to enjoy themselves. He snaps one bench entirely occupied by weary figures who have been left minding the shopping.Few men feature in his Chelsea images. Parr spends the next day at the cricket, realising where all the men have gone. “These are two perfectly matched events – exactly the same types, but the men are at Lords and the women are at Chelsea. Two sides of the same coin.”He is going back to Chelsea for the last day, when the temporary gardens are dismantled and sold. “Mobs of people staggering out trying to carry plants bigger than themselves – that’s what I’m hoping to see. Lovely.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8bacb2c6d4f0661b78cc69d20ee1fd91f16f7202/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3d325996a28cff15f45275036df262e","title":"blind date meg jamie","story":"Did sparks fly between Meg, 28, charity campaigner, and Jamie, 24, management consultant?What were you hoping for?A fun evening with an interesting person.What did you talk about?MSN messenger, scuba ing and Jeff Bezos.Any awkward moments?None that I noticed.Good table manners?Great, even when tackling softshell crab.Best thing about Jamie?He’s easy to talk to and made me laugh.Would you introduce him to your friends?Sure, why not?Describe him in three wordsFunny, interesting, creative.What do you think he made of you?That I was good enough company to talk to until after 11pm on a Monday.Did you go on somewhere?No – see above.And... did you kiss?No.If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be?I’d have eaten more of the posh almonds that came with our drinks.Marks out of 10?8.Would you meet again?He asked for my number, so hopefully we will.What were you hoping for?Free food and good company.First impressions?Happy and relaxed.What did you talk about?B-movies (Sharknado, Croctopus, etc), holiday aspirations and cooking.Any awkward moments?When I arrived early and was taken on a tour of the building.

Now they’re finally having second thoughts. But is it too late? In March, parliament’s foreign affairs committee asked me to come and tell them what to do about dirty Russian cash. As a journalist, I’ve spent much of my career writing about financial corruption in the former Soviet Union, but the invitation came as something of a surprise. After all, ever since I was at school in the 1990s, British politicians have welcomed Russian money to our shores. They have celebrated when oligarchs have bought our football clubs, cheered when they’ve listed their companies on our Stock Exchange. They have gladly accepted their political donations and patronised their charitable foundations.When journalists and academics pointed out that these murky fortunes could buy influence over our democracy and undermine the rule of law, they were largely dismissed as inconvenient Cassandras warning MPs to beware Russians bearing gifts. But earlier this year, after the poisoning in Salisbury of the former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, those little-heeded prophecies jumped straight into the pages of Hansard. “To those who seek to do us harm, my message is simple: you are not welcome here,” Theresa May told the House of Commons on 14 March, in a speech that blamed Russia for the attack. “There is no place for these people, or their money, in our country.”Britain’s entire political class joined the prime minister in this screeching handbrake turn. MPs who had long presented the nation’s openness to trade as a great virtue suddenly wanted to be seen as tough on kleptocrats, tough on the causes of kleptocrats. Having allowing so much Russian money into Britain, these MPs were now seized with concern that Vladimir Putin might, through his power over his nation’s super-rich, be able to influence our institutions. Were we selling Putin the rope with which he would hang us, they wondered.That is why, on 28 March, I took a seat in committee room six, a chamber high up in the Palace of Westminster, with heavy furniture, a view over the River Thames, and a carpet like a migraine. The foreign affairs committee exists to monitor the work of the Foreign Office – essentially, to keep an eye on Boris Johnson – but its members can investigate any subjects they choose. This time, they had chosen to look into the money Putin and his cronies hold in Britain and its overseas territories, with a view to exploring fresh opportunities for sanctions.I had brought along a list of things I wanted to talk about: how we should improve our defences against money laundering how we need transparency about who owns property how MPs themselves must stop taking money from dodgy ex-Soviet oligarchs if they want others to do the same.But the first question, from Priti Patel, the former international development secretary, threw me: “Can you give the committee a sense of the scale of so-called ‘dirty money’ being laundered through London?” she asked.It is a vast question, worthy of a book in itself, and one that even the National Crime Agency would struggle to answer, let alone me. Then came her second question: “What assets has that hidden money gone into?”I tried my best – I mentioned property, private schools, luxury goods – but I think she and I both knew I’d fluffed it. I should have brought along specific examples, with times and dates and names. The embarrassing truth is that, although I have written about Russia and its neighbours for two decades, during which I have increasingly specialised in analysing corruption, it had never really occurred to me to ascertain precisely how much stolen Russian money had found a home in the UK, or to chart exactly where it had ended up.If someone like me had been this culpably incurious, it is hardly surprising that politicians with dozens of other priorities have had to scramble to understand what we’re facing. But for the past couple of months, I have belatedly tried to discover an answer to the foreign affairs committee’s questions.It turns out that the situation is even more worrying than I had suspected.One way to begin investigating exactly how much Russian money there is in Britain – and how much of it is dirty – is to look at the official data. According to Russia’s Federal State Statistics Service, at the end of September, Russian investors held financial assets in the UK worth a total of $3.5bn (£2.6bn). Our own Office of National Statistics provides a broader measure of all Russian investment in the UK, and assessed it – at the end of 2016 – at £25.5bn.That seems like a lot of money but, on a national scale, it’s small change. Investors from Finland alone have a stake in Britain worth twice that much, and we don’t lose sleep over the Finns destabilising our democracy. Sadly, the statistics are telling a misleading story. Russian money that moves through another jurisdiction before arriving in Britain isn’t counted as Russian and, since the overwhelming majority of money that enters and leaves Russia does so via tax havens such as Cyprus and the Bahamas, this means the official figures reflect only a small portion of the money the MPs were interested in.Over the past decade, £68bn has flowed from Russia into Britain’s offshore satellites such as the British Virgin Islands, Cayman, Gibraltar, Jersey and Guernsey. That’s seven times more money than has flowed directly from Russia into the UK. (On top of that, some £94bn has poured out of Russia into Cyprus, £13bn into Switzerland, and £23bn into the Netherlands, which has its own network of tax havens.)This wealth is not actually in the offshore centres – it is just registered there, which helps to obscure its origins. If you’re a Russian official whose wealth is wildly disproportionate to your salary, this anonymity allows you to spend your money in London without anyone realising you’re a crook. The French economist Thomas Piketty estimates that more than half of Russians’ total wealth is held offshore in this manner – some $800bn (£597bn) – and by a tiny number of people, perhaps just a few hundred. “Rich Russians live between London, Monaco and Moscow,” Piketty wrote in a blogpost in April. “Post-communism has become the worst ally of hyper-capitalism.”This means that there is not a single sewer pumping dirty Russian cash into the UK to which we can attach a meter, so as to measure its output. Instead, the cash is diluted into the great tidal flows of liquid capital that pour in and out of the City of London every day, from every corner of the globe. The ordure churned out by Russian crooks and kleptocrats is thus, thanks to the skilled attentions of the tax havens’ best brains, indistinguishable from ordinary investment.One of the few studies to forensically address this phenomenon came from analysts at Deutsche Bank, who, in 2015, looked at discrepancies in the records of money that flows into and out of the UK, and concluded that since the early 1990s, £133bn had arrived here without ever being publicly accounted for. They estimated that “less than half” of that sum was likely to be Russian, which means that Russians could have secret holdings here of up to £67.5bn, on top of the officially declared figure. (That is still a small amount compared with the holdings of German, American or French investors.)So whose money is this? How is it getting here? The bank’s analysts didn’t look into that question. However, had they wanted to, they could have walked down the hall and asked their colleagues, since it turned out that Deutsche Bank itself was a significant culprit in spiriting money out of Russia without informing the authorities. Less than two years after the report – called Dark Matter – was published, Deutsche Bank traders in Moscow were caught secretly moving $10bn (£7.5bn) of their clients’ money out of Russia by illegally exploiting the stock market. (As a result, the bank had to pay fines of $425m (£317m) in the US and £163m in the UK.)With institutions as sophisticated as Deutsche Bank working to hide Russian money, it is unsurprising that the total amount in the UK remains vague. So there is no real answer to the foreign affairs committee’s first question, except to say that the volume of Russian money in Britain is far larger than the official statistics would have us think.There are two reasons why we should be worried about this. The first is the low-probability but high-impact chance that Putin is hiding money here in the financial equivalent of sleeper cells, ready to slip out and buy influence when a crisis comes. The second is more significant: no one steals money if they can’t keep it. By letting Putin’s allies launder their stolen fortunes, and hide them in our country, we are drawing a line under their crimes, and rewarding them for actions we should not be condoning. Do we really want Britain to be the Kremlin’s fence?To attempt an answer to Priti Patel’s second question – what assets has all this money gone into? – we need to look at how wealthy Russians responded to the collapse of communism. They chose to spend their newly freed money on assets they had long been denied, and ones that could not be taken away from them. Above all, they bought luxury goods and property outside their own country, particularly in London.In early 1993, rich Russians were enough of a novelty for the Independent to report that three of them had bought flats in Kensington – at prices between £200,000 and £320,000 – under the headline “Property – a haven for rich refugees”. A month later, a Russian tycoon dropped £1.1m on a house in Hampstead, and then bought all the contents, too. “All he took into the house were four televisions and a vanload of carrier bags from Harrods,” an estate agent told the Evening Standard.Those purchases were the first ripples of a tsunami of wealth that crashed over the whole south-east of England, with spectacular consequences. In 2013, an analysis by the estate agency Knight Frank estimated that almost a tenth of all buyers at the top end of the London market came from the former Soviet Union, while rival estate agents Savills calculated that Russians like to buy the biggest houses of any group of purchasers. Average house prices in Kensington have risen eightfold over the past two decades, at least partly thanks to the influx from Russia.The poster boy for ostentatious expenditure has been the oligarch Roman Abramovich, who bought Chelsea football club in 2003. But even his London house – valued at £125m – was second ision in the spending league. In April 2011, a Ukrainian bought the world’s most expensive flat – the penthouse at One Hyde Park – for £136.4m. Five months later, a Russian bought Park Place, a stately home near Henley-on-Thames, for £140m. Russians who acquired homes valued merely in the tens of millions barely deserved notice.Among those lesser buyers was a banker called Grigory Guselnikov, a boyish 42-year-old who moved to London in 2008. He and his family came on tier 1 investor visas, which provide successful applicants with residency in exchange for an investment (of, at the time, £1m) in government bonds. In the eight years to September 2015, Russian citizens made up 764 of the 3,396 people who paid for these so-called golden visas – making them the second largest group of applicants, after Chinese citizens. This arrangement brought in around £800m of Russian investment, but the flow dropped markedly after April 2015, when the UK authorities began to check the origin of the money used to buy these government bonds. Once rigorous checks were put in place and the price of the visa was doubled, the number of applications fell sharply. In the final quarter of last year, just 16 Russians applied for a golden visa.Guselnikov believes that politicians’ sudden panic about Russian money in Britain is misplaced. When we met in his office in a grand terraced house on Grosvenor Square, he began by pointing out that Russian money had less influence over British business than people think. “I can’t recall any big enterprise controlled by Russians, or any big company. They open restaurants, wine shops, they buy luxury stuff like football clubs.“Where the impact is significant is real estate,” Guselnikov continued. “And primarily real estate in London.” His most high-profile investment was the shop that houses the Rolex concession on the ground floor of One Hyde Park, which he bought in 2011 for £12m (and sold for £20m three years later), and which demonstrates the peculiar dynamics at the top end of the property market, where the price of residential property is inflated beyond any conceivable income it could generate. “There is a shop, with advertising, 300 sq metres and the price is £12m. The flat above has no advertising, no shop, no ability to make money it’s the same size, 300 sq metres, and cost £25m. The shop was two times cheaper than the flat, that was really funny,” he said, with a laugh.His second point was that it was a misconception to think Russians are Machiavellian masterminds buying up slabs of Britain in order to undermine us from within. “You have to understand why people buy real estate abroad – they see it as their pension, they want to ersify the risk. In Russia, you have to be ready to lose everything, you never know what will happen,” he said. “They just spend money here. They don’t invest, they spend.”One reason the Russian super-rich come to Britain, Guselnikov said, was for education. His own children attended private schools, although they now have British passports, so they were not counted among the 2,806 Russian children attending schools surveyed by the Independent Schools Council last year. By multiplying that total with the average fees parents pay, we can calculate that a minimum of £48.3m comes to Britain’s private schools each year from Russia.Guselnikov said banks had become more stringent in their checks on the provenance of money in the last few years, so it was unlikely that significant flows of dirty money were entering the UK from Russia any more. But he conceded things had been different in the past. “If any dirty money is invested in UK property, it was before 2008 or before 2011 at the latest, not now. I don’t think the UK’s attractive any more, I don’t think it’s possible any more,” he said.It may well be that, as Guselnikov said, many honest Russian businesspeople have indeed been behind these purchases of London property. However, thanks to tax havens and skilled enablers from the world’s major financial institutions, their money has been mingled with the proceeds of theft, bribery and corruption. Imagining that Britain will be unscathed by this influx is the macro equivalent of letting a kidnapper, a bent copper, and a heroin trafficker move into your village, and still expecting warm chats at the school gates.Transparency International published a report last year, which, relying only on public sources of information, identified 160 properties in the UK, together worth £4.4bn, that had been bought by what it called “high-corruption-risk iniduals”. Most of those properties were in London, and half of them were within three miles of Buckingham Palace – and that is just a fraction of the true total. “There is currently no credible deterrent in place for money-laundering failings from estate agents,” the report noted.Two years ago, a former fund manager called Bill Browder gave evidence to parliament’s home affairs committee in which he revealed how $30m (£22m) that had been stolen from the Russian state by a group of corrupt police officers and officials had come to the UK, via 12 different banks, and been spent on an array of luxury goods: $176,000 went on chartering a private jet $192,000 on redecorating a yacht $20,000 on private school fees $41,000 on a wedding dress $295,000 to pay off an exclusive women-only credit card that offers “the most privileged and luxurious service”.Browder, who was born in the US but is a British citizen, ran a successful Moscow-based fund until 2007, when the corrupt officials fraudulently claimed ownership of two of his investment companies. They realised that, by fiddling the books, they could claw back the $230m in taxes that he had paid on the year’s profits, which is what they did. The $30m that ended up in the UK derived from this act of grand larceny. When Browder’s lawyer Sergei Magnitsky exposed the fraud, he was arrested and detained in jail, where he was beaten and denied treatment for pancreatitis until he died. Browder has devoted the years since Magnitsky’s death to seeking justice for his lawyer, and punishment for those responsible. He employs a team of forensic accountants, who have traced the movement of the money that was stolen from the Russian budget.The spending that he described to parliament fitted the pattern laid out by Guselnikov: it was being blown on luxury goods, rather than being invested to win influence over British politics or society. But that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be concerned about it. This money should have been paid as taxes and spent on hospitals, schools and other services in Russia. Instead, it had been stolen from taxpayers and splashed on an absurd array of goodies. This is the kind of money Britain has been happily fencing for decades. Even now, British MPs only seem to care about it because its owners might harm our national security, rather than because it should be returned to the people it was originally stolen from.Browder told the home affairs committee that he had traced chunks of the stolen money to 11 other countries – including France, Switzerland and the US – and investigators in every one of those countries had opened criminal cases based on the information he provided. But in Britain – where he had spoken to the politan police, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (now part of the National Crime Agency), the Serious Fraud Office, and HMRC – he had been turned away every time.Why was Britain the only country that declined to act on the information Browder provided? His conclusion was that too many influential people – lawyers, bankers, accountants, property developers – were dependent on dirty Russian money for their livelihoods. “If that money was stopped,” he said in 2016, “certain people would find themselves without businesses, and I think those people have political weight in this country.”Many British institutions have indeed accepted donations from wealthy Russian businesspeople: Sadiq Khan’s City Hall from Elena Baturina, whose husband was mayor of Moscow the Conservative party from Lubov Chernukhin, whose husband was one of Putin’s ministers, and who paid £160,000 to play tennis with Boris Johnson and David Cameron in 2014.But it is not venal politicians who are stopping British police conducting investigations into the laundering of Russian money in the UK. According to Tristram Hicks, who was the detective superintendent in charge of economic crime at the Met until 2009, and who now acts as a freelance consultant to police forces around the world, the problem is far more serious than that.In order to prosecute a foreign crook in Britain, you need to prove their money originated in a crime of some kind, and that requires evidence from overseas. Essentially, if you want to prosecute a Kremlin insider, you need evidence from the Kremlin, which naturally it will not provide, and that stops investigations from progressing. And this is not just a British problem. After France, Switzerland and the Netherlands received information from Browder that some of the stolen $230m had been spent in their countries, they froze the assets in question – but their criminal investigations are yet to secure convictions. Only US prosecutors have managed a result, and even that was just an out-of-court settlement, without an admission of guilt by the defendant. “You cannot underestimate the technical hurdle that is bringing the evidence to a British standard for a British court,” Hicks said.That isn’t the only obstacle to investigating money laundering. Given that all wealthy Russians have political connections – otherwise, they wouldn’t be wealthy – if the UK does gain cooperation from Russian investigators in a prosecution, the defendant will invariably claim, often with good reason, that he is being politically persecuted, which allows his lawyers to discount the evidence being used against him.Take Andrey Borodin, the owner of that £140m house in Henley-on-Thames. He arrived in Britain in 2011, pursued by Russian charges of having defrauded his own bank. Borodin insisted the charges were politically motivated, and gained asylum here. Had prosecutors brought charges in the UK, his lawyers could have discounted any evidence from Russia as the revenge of political rivals, and Hicks conceded this would essentially doom the prosecution’s case. “That’s hard to argue against,” he said.There is also a third difficulty that Hicks didn’t address, which is just as serious. If a wealthy, ruthless Russian faces investigation, he can stop any chance of prosecution by killing the witnesses. This may well have been what happened to Alexander Litvinenko, who was murdered with radioactive polonium-210 in 2006, and who was working with Spanish and British authorities to expose Russian money flows. It may also explain the death of Alexander Perepilichny, a 44-year-old banker who was helping Browder’s team to understand the destination of the $230m stolen from the Russian budget, and who died while jogging in Surrey in 2012. Investigators at first thought he had suffered a heart attack, but it appears that he may have been poisoned with a rare plant extract.In short, to bring a successful money-laundering prosecution against a wealthy Russian, officers need to win cooperation from Moscow, which is all but impossible to convince a UK court that any cooperation that does result was not politically motivated, which is extremely difficult and then to keep their witnesses alive, which has proven rather hard. In the circumstances, it’s not surprising that the NCA decided bringing a prosecution in the Magnitsky case was not the best use of its resources.The amazing thing is that we have tolerated this situation for so long. Britain has consistently welcomed Russian money, and consistently ignored the warnings of those concerned about what it is buying. In March 2000, when Putin was still just acting president and had spent six months pulverising Chechnya, Tony Blair dashed to St Petersburg to be the first western leader to secure a meeting with the new man, and to urge more investment in each other’s countries.At least Blair could claim not to have known what kind of man Putin was, but David Cameron had no such excuse. In September 2011, Cameron went to Moscow to seek business for the City of London, although most of the facts that are currently concerning MPs about Russia were already known. Litvinenko had been murdered five years previously, and Russia had given one of the Met’s suspects in the case a seat in parliament. Magnitsky had died in jail two years earlier, and his tormentors were walking free. But Cameron went to Moscow anyway.“The whole point about trade is that we are baking a bigger cake and everyone can benefit from it and this is particularly true, perhaps, of Russia and Britain. Russia is resource-rich and services-light whereas Britain is the opposite,” Cameron told students at Moscow State University, on a trip that also involved meetings with Putin and his then placeholder president Dmitry Medvedev.In his speech, Cameron boasted that Russian companies accounted for a quarter of share offerings on the London Stock Exchange. “Governments need to remember that businesses don’t have to invest in our country – they choose to. And we need to help them make that choice,” Cameron said. “It means minimising the burden of regulation so that business and entrepreneurship can flourish.”With a prime minister who considered regulations on the origin of money to be a burden, it’s unsurprising that not many of them were made. This approach did not of course begin with Cameron, or even with Blair. In fact, it goes back to the mid-20th century. After the second world war, Britain was all but bankrupt, the City of London was somnolent, and economic power rested on Wall Street. City bankers wanted to get back into business, but were frustrated by the weakness of the pound, and its unsuitability as a means to finance the world’s trade.Their salvation came from an unlikely quarter: the Soviet Union, which didn’t want to keep its dollar reserves in US banks. Instead, it kept them in London, where British banks began lending them to each other in an entirely unregulated market – they became known as “Eurodollars” – thus giving birth to offshore finance, and providing the City with the startup capital it needed to get back in business. By the end of the communist period, Soviet institutions routinely sent their money through Britain’s offshore territories, and the City was booming. The Central Bank in Moscow even had a shell company in Jersey, which it used to hide money from the government that it was supposedly a part of.This is one of the problems with trying to ascertain the volume of dirty Russian money in London: how far back do we go? Do the fees Midland Bank received for banking Soviet money in the 1950s still count as Russian cash, and if so, are they dirty? Does the commission the estate agent earned by selling those flats in Kensington in the early 1990s count as dirty money? And what about the £800m that Russians paid for government bonds in return for golden visas? Or the $41,000 of Magnitsky money that was spent on a wedding dress in London? How many times does money have to circulate in the economy before we decide it’s not dirty any more?This money is so deeply embedded in the UK that extracting it, or even identifying it, would be an unrivalled feat of investigation. “It would be impossible,” says Prem Sikka, professor of accounting at Sheffield University. “They have the big accountancy firms advising them where best to stash the money, to conceal it, to disguise it, all kind of things. The brains of this pinstriped mafia are available to everyone. They’re for hire.”Recently, I spoke to Jon Benton, who led teams fighting dirty money at the Met and the NCA, and advised Cameron at the Cabinet Office, until his retirement in 2016. “We used to get these suspicious activity reports coming in, Russian ones, all the time. It would be for an investment or a property or a load of other things,” Benton said. “You’re looking at something that doesn’t look right, doesn’t smell right, but we had a tiny number of resources. To get caught up in some really complex Russian money-laundering case, when we weren’t going to get any assistance – you have to weigh it up. Do I try to throw lots of resources at this, when I know I’m really going to struggle to get the door open?”Benton was optimistic about the introduction of so-called unexplained wealth orders, which came into effect in February this year. Once a UWO has been issued, property is frozen, and its owner has to respond and justify why they own it. But that will only confiscate property, Benton noted. It won’t put anyone in jail.“The time when we might have been able to do something about this was 20 years ago, when it wasn’t particularly sophisticated, and the large sums of money were just arriving in the country,” he said. By ignoring the provenance of dirty cash, and allowing it to be spent on property, British authorities have cleansed it of its taint: it is legitimate investment now. “Unpicking all that is a real challenge. The reality is that it’s probably the hardest area to penetrate in the world.”We don’t know how much dirty money there is in the UK, nor do we know exactly where it is, and there’s nothing we can do about it. Or rather, there’s nothing we can do about it with the laws as they stand, and without giving greater resources to law enforcement agencies. Almost 100,000 UK properties are currently owned via offshore companies, obscuring their ownership, many of them undoubtedly by Russian criminals and kleptocrats we could happily do without. The government has promised to force these offshore companies to disclose their true owners, but that won’t be until 2021. For the next three years, criminals will be free to profit from their property in the UK without admitting they own it. Why can’t we hurry that up? To answer both of Priti Patel’s questions – how much money is there, and where is it? – we need transparency.The foreign affairs committee published its conclusions this week, drawing on the evidence that I and others gave it, and they were impressively robust. Its report demanded a more coherent government approach to the “assets stored and laundered in London (which) both directly and indirectly support President Putin’s campaign to subvert the international rules-based system, undermine our allies, and erode the mutually reinforcing international networks that support UK foreign policy”.Earlier this week, it was reported that Abramovich is finding it hard to renew his British visa, and some newspapers are speculating that this suggests Britain is already pioneering a new approach to Russian money, one that demands checks on the fortunes even of the very richest, and even when there is no apparent evidence of corruption. We do not yet know the reasons for the delay in the Chelsea owner’s visa, but such checks should be welcomed anyway: in cases where evidence emerges that someone is corrupt, that person should be kept out of Britain. But this alone is insufficient we need to find the dodgy money that is already here. Confiscating it and finding a way to return it to the Russian people would diminish those who mean us harm, while simultaneously helping those we wish to befriend.That requires strengthening Britain’s investigative power. The National Crime Agency and the UK’s police forces currently lack the resources to bring the prosecutions that could really make a difference to criminals’ calculation about whether to bring their money here. If we wish to prevent Russian kleptocrats from buying our country, we need to start catching them and their enablers in the act, and prosecuting them. That is the only true deterrent.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d08499cf0bb5d1a94fa3224f42443f8cc34bf89c/0_0_5426_3394/master/5426.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=130a15b8c7067debae1656b7ca0b09c4","title":"majority of eu27 favour simple approach on britons residency","story":"Only about 10 countries likely to use system similar to that planned by UK for EU nationalsA majority of the EU27 do not plan to force UK nationals living within their borders to apply for a special residency status after Brexit, in contrast to the UK government’s treatment of EU nationals.An initial meeting of officials and diplomats in Brussels on the treatment of UK nationals post-Brexit found a mood in favour of a “smooth and simple” approach.Governments across Europe have different approaches to dealing with foreign EU nationals who move to live in their country, with some encouraging or demanding registration.Many in the meeting on Friday expressed the view that imposing an additional mandatory system on British nationals in their country would prove an unnecessary complication and expense.Britons who move to EU countries before the post-Brexit transition period ends on 31 December 2020 will be granted rights similar to those available today, although with some gaps, including the right to onward movement between member states.The UK has opted to set up a new system for resident EU nationals, under which applicants will be charged £72 each. The former home secretary Amber Rudd vowed it would be as simple as setting up a shopping account with the high-end retailer LK Bennett.It subsequently emerged that the app for the system would not work on iPhones, a brand used by more than half of the adult population in the UK.Ingrid Taylor, 61, a translator who has lived in Germany for 30 years and who is a member of the lobby group British in Europe, said her fellow Britons abroad were keen to avoid unnecessary paperwork.“We need some kind of document to show that we have rights but it should be a declaratory system, not a long application that people have to fill out,” she said. “That will bring all sorts of problems and pitfalls, as we have seen with the 85-page permanent residence application form in the UK.”Of the 27 member states represented in the meeting in Brussels on Friday, about 10 were minded to establish a system similar to the UK’s with 17 were opposed, according to EU sources.Of those with the most UK nationals, Spain said it was undecided and representatives for France did not share their thoughts. Germany said it was undecided but was leaning towards an obligatory system for Britons, in order for the government to be able to recognise people conferred with rights under the withdrawal agreement and those not.The European commission proposed a uniform set of identification documents to be made available for UK nationals who make their home in the EU before the end of the transition period. A follow-up meeting on the issue is expected in September.

The vouchers are available to any woman who receives benefits such as income support or jobseeker’s allowance, or who lives in a home where someone does.The vouchers were brought in UK-wide in 2006 by Labour in an effort to improve the diets of poorer families and narrow the nutritional gap between rich and poor. Specialist children’s doctors and public health experts have praised the scheme for playing a key role in tackling obesity and ensuring low-income families can access healthy foods that some may otherwise struggle to afford.The Labour MP Frank Field, a former welfare minister and veteran anti-poverty campaigner, who obtained the take-up figures through parliamentary questions, said: “Healthy Start vouchers have quietly developed into a key weapon in our armoury to defeat malnutrition. They radically improve poorer families’ diets by increasing their consumption of fruit and vegetables as well as vitamin intake, while simultaneously reducing the pressure on their weekly budgets.“As things stand, too many of the most disadvantaged families remain exposed to malnutrition because they are not registered for the scheme.”Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the low take-up was worrying given rising obesity.“Eating well early in life is key to ensuring good eating habits last into adulthood,” he said. “We know that children living in the UK’s poorest households are more likely to be overweight and have poor nutrition, which is why this scheme is vital. “The low uptake is particularly concerning as this week a commitment to deliver the Healthy Start vouchers appears to have been dropped as a priority from the Department for Health and Social Care’s business plan.”Failure to register could be linked to not knowing the vouchers exist, the system’s complexity, and stigma of exchanging them for food, he said. “My plea to the prime minister is to take all necessary steps towards securing full take-up, perhaps by initiating a policy of automatic registration which overcomes issues around stigma and complexity,” Field said. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: “The Healthy Start scheme provides vital assistance to help children from lower income families access free fruit, vegetables, milk and vitamins.“While participating is a personal choice for eligible families, we publicise it widely to encourage uptake. It is also promoted at a local level through midwives and healthcare professionals, and we are exploring how digital technology could make it easier to receive Healthy Start benefits in the future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40c4c63ef54e9f831af540cbb774bf8a2afe85f9/708_881_4504_2703/master/4504.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0906ab051d1c01e6742de0cad3798dee","title":"chris froome solo pink jersey giro ditalia stage for the ages cycling","story":"• Remarkable breakaway catapults Briton to the front• Simon Yates falls out of contention amid stage dramaOn one of the most extraordinary days in Giro d’Italia history Chris Froome produced a performance that ripped the breath away, obliterating his rivals with a solo 80km escape to seize the maglia rosa with two stages remaining.It was remarkable to watch, especially up close. For not only did Froome defy a series of brutal climbs and temperatures that climbed into the 80s but he continued to take massive chunks of time out of the overnight leader, Simon Yates, and then Tom Dumoulin during a breakaway that began on the Colle Delle Finestre and lasted more than two hours.“It was going to take something really special to get rid of Simon and to get away from Dumoulin,” admitted Froome. “I wasn’t going to go from fourth to first on the last climb alone, so I had to do it from far out and Colle Delle Finestre was the perfect place to do it. The gravel road reminds me of riding in Africa and I just felt good and thought, ‘It is now or never.’”Yet cycling’s charred history inevitably means that “something really special” will, rightly or wrongly, be accompanied by suspicion. And Froome, remember, is riding under a cloud as he fights to clear his name having failed a drugs test for salbutamol in September, as first revealed by the .Many – including David Lappartient, the president of UCI, cycling’s world governing body – also believe Sky should have withdrawn the 33-year-old until his case was resolved. However, Froome insists he has done nothing wrong and continues to fight to clear his name.”I know I have done nothing wrong and soon that will be clear to everyone,” Froome said. “There will always be one comment or another but the fans in Italy have been great, so grazie mille.”For now, though, his sole focus is on becoming the first man since Bernard Hinault in 1982-83 – and only the third in history after Hinault and Eddy Merckx – to hold all three grand tours, the Tour de France, Vuelta a España and the Giro, at the same time. Given his astonishing performance, which quickly erased a 3min 22sec deficit over Yates and then put him 40 seconds clear of his nearest challenger, Dumoulin, that looks a certainty.Before Friday’s 19th stage from Venaria Reale to Bardonecchia everyone knew that Froome would attack on the Finestre, the Cima Coppi of this year’s Giro, with its 45 hairpin bends along a summit 2,178m high. No one, though, expected the attack to be so frenzied or so sustained.Before the start Yates’s directeur sportif at Michelton-Scott, Matt Scott, had punchily dismissed suggestions that his man was spent – or that Froome was a threat to the maglia rosa.” If it happens it will be on the Finestre,” he conceded. “But we’re ready for it.”Yet his best-laid plans soon turned to dust as Yates cracked early and began to ride with all the uncertainty of a club rider on his first hors catégorie climb. For two weeks the 25-year-old from Bury had worn the pink jersey with distinction. Now he had to suffer the ignominy of finishing 38 minutes back.Froome, however, was merely getting started. A sustained attack with 80km remaining instantly left the rest of the field gasping and by the summit of the Finestre, he had already opened a gap of 42 seconds to a group of four riders headed by Dumoulin.“We took the decision on Thursday night to ride in this way,” saidFroome. “I know the roads like the back of my hand so it made it a lot easier. It was a big risk to attack so far from the finish but it was a well-calculated risk. The team were fantastic, they made a really strong pace at the Colle Delle Finestre to make the pace for me to go. This is what bike racing is all about.”At the summit Froome passed a man in an inhaler suit – a reference to his failed salbutamol test – but he still wanted more. And he found it on a thrilling descent. At times his riding looked reckless and at one stage a motorcycle had to brake suddenly to avoid knocking him off his bike but it was hugely effective.By the time Froome began his climb up the Sestriere, an ascent famous for Lance Armstrong breaking away from the bunch in the 1999 Tour de France, Froome’s lead had extended to one minute and 52 seconds.Try as he might, Dumoulin was unable to respond and by the time Froome passed the “40km to go” sign, he was virtual race leader – although there was nearly disaster when he had to swerve past a crashed motorbike. That, however, was only a minor hiccup and Froome continued to power up to the finish at Bardonecchia.Now with only Saturday’s 214km stage from Susa to Cervinia facing him before reaching Rome on Sunday, Froome stands on the verge of an astonishing victory – and he clearly has no plans to falter now.“We are not going to celebrate just yet,” he said. “But we can see how quickly things can change here. I gave it everything but I tried to stay within my limits so hopefully we can finish this off tomorrow.”Yates was mystified at his performance: “At the start there was no signs of anything wrong. I was just tired, extremely exhausted and that’s bike riding unfortunately. I tried to manage (the gap) but I really had nothing to give.“I gave everything today,” he added. “It’s just how it is. But I’ll be back. It obviously hurts, but I have said all along that this is how I needed to ride this Giro to try to win it and if I achieved nothing more I can still be happy. And I will be.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60ef9e6215aa210abc68c62948153390876bbb63/0_75_3394_2037/master/3394.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2ec63c6cf5f47b2ca72ed4f1857bc8b","title":"cleveland cavaliers boston celtics lebron james nba playoffs","story":"LeBron James scored 46 points and preserved his reign atop the Eastern Conference for at least one more game as the Cleveland Cavaliers shook off losing All-Star Kevin Love with a head injury to beat the Boston Celtics 109-99 on Friday night and force a Game 7.James, playing in what could be his final game for the Cavs in Cleveland, delivered another sensational performance as he added 11 rebounds and nine assists while playing all but two minutes to avoid elimination and delay any decisions about his future this off-season. “It feels good just to be able to play for another game,” James said. “Like I’ve always said, Game 7 is the best two words in sports. ... We should relish the opportunity and have fun with it.”This back-and-forth series, in which home court has meant everything, will have a climatic conclusion Sunday at TD Center, where the Celtics are 10-0 this post-season.“We have one game to be able to compete for a championship, and what more could you ask for?” James said. “If I’d have told you at the beginning of the season we only needed one game to make the NBA finals, we’d take it.”George Hill added 20 points, and Jeff Green 14 for the Cavs. They won their eighth straight at home and will play their second Game 7 of these playoffs. Terry Rozier paced the Celtics with 28 points, and Jaylen Brown had 27.The Celtics were still within seven in the final three minutes before James made consecutive three-pointers, punctuating the second by pounding his chest with both fists and screaming along with the home fans. Just for good measure, he added a three-point play and then was taken out of the game to a rousing ovation and chants of “Cavs in 7!” “Just a lot of heart, a lot of grit, bring resilient,” James said.Boston’s improbable run through the postseason without injured stars Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward will now take the Celtics back home, where they play with more intensity, togetherness and before fans hungry to see an 18th title banner raised to their arena’s rafters.Love went out with a head injury in the first quarter, forcing Cavs coach Tyronn Lue to juggle his rotations and keep James on the floor longer than he wanted to. The three-time NBA champion played the first 35 minutes without a break and then endured the final eight while nursing a sore lower leg.Backed by a sea of towel-waving fans wearing white “Cleveland Whatever It Takes” T-shirts, James did just that to push the series to Boston, where he has had some of his biggest moments on the renowned parquet floor.In 2014, he had 45 points, 15 rebounds and five assists in Game 6 for Miami, who went on to win Game 7 and the NBA title. He also scored 45 in a Game 7 loss for Cleveland in 2008, and now has a chance to boost his stunning resume further if he can get the Cavs to a fourth consecutive Finals.James has also had some bitter memories in Boston. He lost Game 6 in the East semifinals in 2010 to the Celtics and was soon on his way to joining the Heat.The real possibility that James was playing his last game in Cleveland hung over the game and Cleveland in the hours leading to tip-off on Friday night. The 33-year-old has said several times since coming home in 2014 that he wants to retire with the Cavaliers, but fans are uneasy because he can opt out of his $35.6m contract this summer and test free agency.James has said he’ll sit down with his family after the season ends to plot his next move, and he’s already being courted in Philadelphia, Los Angeles and New York. For now, though, he’s only going to Boston.

The pattern of the game was sustained as Pakistan outplayed England by dint of solid, unspectacular, old-fashioned virtues. This is not how Pakistan are supposed to prevail. In the past the inspired, stream of consciousness cricket of Waqar and Wasim, Mushtaq and Qadir, and Anwar and Inzamam has enthralled and intimidated, depending on your vantage point .But here for two sessions the Pakistan team was clinical and patient, dutifully grinding down an England side which contains three players who in recent times have been accustomed to spending only 20 overs in the field at any one time. Then in the final session they played a few more shots against a weary attack.England had to work hard to remove all the batsmen except Sarfraz Ahmed, whose top-edged hook would have provoked stern words in the dressing room were he not the captain. Four batsmen exceeded 50, one of whom, Babar Azam, had to retire hurt having been hit on his left forearm by a short ball from Ben Stokes, who produced\u0026nbspthe most hostile bowling of the day. That spell aside, when Stokes bowled nine consecutive overs interrupted by the tea interval, the England bowlers were no more than persistent, while their out-cricket was far from flawless four chances of varying difficulty were spilt.In cloudy conditions, where the ball obstinately refused to swing as much as it did for Pakistan on Thursday, the batsmen were prepared to wait for their chance of runs in the knowledge that the ball can speed away from the square at Lord’s like putts from the wrong side of the green at Augusta. Pakistan were prepared to play the long game and they did so with great resolution and a little luck since there was always sufficient movement for the ball to pass the outside edge. On similar days in the past Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson have run through sub-continental teams here.Run-scoring seemed easiest at the start. In the first half hour when Anderson over-pitched in vain pursuit of swing Haris Sohail drove him for two fours in an over and it was not until the introduction of Mark Wood that a wicket fell. Maybe anticipating another bouncer Sohail was stuck on the crease and edged to the keeper. Anderson looked more dangerous – especially against the right-handers – when he switched to the Nursery End. He found a suggestion of away swing and dispatched Azhar Ali lbw for a valuable 50.England could not capitalise after lunch despite bowling Anderson and Broad in tandem. On 10 Babar offered a tricky catch off Anderson, low down and to Alastair Cook’s right at first slip. A poor review against Asad Shafiq for lbw when Wood was bowling hinted at England’s frustration. So much for home advantage. In archetypal English conditions it was Pakistan who were taking control. An edged upper cut by Shafiq and he became the second half-centurion in the Pakistan innings.Until now Stokes had been sparingly used. Root had allowed Dom Bess his first prolonged spell in Test cricket and he bowled competently enough but he discovered neither a hint of turn nor any batsman who might be in the least alarmed by some conventional finger-spin. A small error in length and the batsmen, relieved to have a bit of respite from the seamers, patted the ball away into the gaps.Stokes inconvenienced them a great deal more in the fieriest spell of the innings, during which he occasionally exceeded 90mph. On 59 Shafiq cut in the air and Jos Buttler in the gully took off to his left, parrying the ball towards Dawid Malan at second slip but it did not reach him, a technical chance but not an expensive miss. Stokes steamed in again and this time Shafiq could only parry a short, fast delivery, this time in a gentle parabola straight to Malan.Just before tea Stokes set his field for bouncers, which were duly delivered and the mercurial Sarfraz soon obliged with a top-edged hook, whose descent kept Wood at fine leg waiting for a disconcertingly long time. But the catch was taken.After the interval Stokes continued, taking the new ball rather than Anderson. Now Babar, who had batted purposefully throughout, failed to pick up another short delivery, which thudded into his left forearm. After a long delay in which the physio surveyed the damage, applied an ice pack and – who knows? – asked the name of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Babar left the field, with tests later confirming he had suffered a fractured wrist.England may have sensed that the door was ajar but now two young all-rounders, calmly and with some silky strokeplay, closed it. England’s out-cricket became ever more fallible. Shadab Khan and Faheem Ashraf had already added 50 together when two more chances went begging. In consecutive overs Faheem, on 29, edged between Jonny Bairstow and Cook off the exasperated Wood. Then Cook dropped the most straightforward chance of the day, a regulation slip catch given by Shadab on 30 off Anderson. This pair had added a sparky 72 together when Anderson could smile, though certainly not beam in exultation, at another Test wicket, having bowled Faheem off the inside edge.Shadab flailed once too often at Stokes after making a sparky 52 but at the close Pakistan were 166 ahead, which should be more than enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b926064322789347fca7fd864e31583985f7a29/0_289_5207_3124/master/5207.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9afde7a0bd611eb432f09e7081c38425","title":"golf pga championship wentworth rory mcilroy","story":"Another day returned another Rory McIlroy milestone at Wentworth. After the Northern Irishman had produced his finest opening round at the PGA Championship he recorded a 65 on day two, playing the West Course bogey-free for the first time.McIlroy denied his charge to the top of the leaderboard – where he sits at 12 under par – would turn heads among fellow competitors. The reality is different. The former world No\u0026nbsp1 in this touch remains a seriously imposing figure. Alex Noren, who played alongside him, said he felt like “quitting golf” after watching the ease with which the 29-year-old produced seven birdies. “That’s the best round I’ve ever seen,” the Swede said.Just do not suggest to the man himself that a second success at this event is inevitable from here or even that he expects it. “Jeez, no,” McIlroy stressed. “I could shoot two 65s over the weekend and still not win.“All you ask for is giving yourself a chance every week. I’ve put myself in a good position after two days. Hopefully I’m in a good position after three days and then it will be nice to get out there hopefully on Sunday in a position where I can try to win. That would give me a huge bit of confidence going into the summer.”Explanation for McIlroy’s upturn in fortunes has many facets. “I love this place,” is clearly one. Another requires the context of 2017, when injury prevented the four-times major champion from ironing out any swing flaws when they arose. After a poor Players Championship earlier this month, off-course work is paying idends.McIlroy confirmed he had stopped working with the putting guru Phil Kenyon, with a view to “keeping ownership” of his work on the greens. For all that coaching in golf is inevitable, the Northern Irishman is far too much of a natural artist to be bogged down by statistics and instruction.The marquee moment of his Friday round was a converted birdie putt from 50 feet on the 15th. Proof, however, of McIlroy’s point regarding scope for improvement can be found in the fact he has played the closing two holes, both generous par-fives, in even par over two days.Sam Horsfield emerged from the pack to chase McIlroy. The 21-year-old’s second round of 68 moved him to minus nine. This marks a debut in the tournament for the Englishman, a long-time protégé of Ian Poulter. “Any time you’re playing on the weekend and you’re up there near Rory, I think you’re going to be doing pretty well,” said Horsfield.“This golf course is really good for me. I like the way it is.”The 2010 US Open champion, Graeme McDowell, sits at minus six after adding a 67 to Thursday’s 71. Thomas Bjorn, Europe’s Ryder Cup captain, was among those to miss the cut.Poulter was joining the early exodus on the 16th tee. The Houston Open champion then responded in typical style. Three birdies in his closing three holes left him on three under par and comfortably among those surviving for the weekend.One of Poulter’s playing partners, Tommy Fleetwood, made a late Friday surge. His 66 means an aggregate of eight under par. Logic would suggest he will be McIlroy’s greatest threat.“Who knows what Rory is going to do?” said Fleetwood, who won Europe’s money-list title last season. “Obviously he’s the one that everybody is going to be looking at and he’s the one that’s got the lead. I might go out and play terrible tomorrow but I’ll be trying my heart out.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffa7cf9c12d309dd559b87766bfeef7c22a1f676/0_118_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b42c6dc169b13b8ac345761c56e8792","title":"johanna konta game prosper clay paris","story":"British No1 faces Yulia Putintseva in the first round of the French Open having fallen to 22nd in the world rankingsJohanna Konta insists she is comfortable playing on clay – despite a thin résumé in five visits to Roland Garros. It says much for her self-belief.“This is only my third French Open main draw by ranking,” she said, “so I think it would be a little bit unfair to say completely that my record is terrible. I would like to give it a few more years.”She has a chance to prove doubters wrong against the demonstrative Kazak battler Yulia Putintseva with whom she wiped the clay of Rome the last time they met, a year ago. However, losing to the delightfully artistic doubles specialist Hsieh Su-wei here last year after winning the first set 6-1, was the upset of the opening round. And the year before, she went out at the first time of asking against Julia Goerges, who was ranked 57 in the world but had struck form.“I’ve only qualified for two slams and one of them was here, so I have experienced success in Paris. The one last year was an incredibly tough one against Su-wei – and we’ve all seen since then how well she can play.“Before that was against Julia Goerges, who plays incredibly well on this surface and made the final in Nuremburg the week before. So there needs to be respect given to the players that I played and the level that they produced.“But, as for how I feel on the surface, every year that I come here I look forward to it because I know I can play well on the clay. Before I started playing more on the WTA tour I actually won most of my Challengers on the clay, especially at the very beginning. I’d like to give myself a little more time.”That confidence might come under pressure in her first match.“You’ll need to ask her why she does it,” Konta said of Putintseva’s ability to light up a court with her language as well as her racket. “In my experience, most players act the way they do in their own self-interest, in getting their emotions out and basically working with their own demons on court. She will deal with the match the way she feels she needs to deal with it to win, and I will deal with the match the way that I feel I need to deal with it to win.”Konta’s penchant to see all sides of a debate should qualify her to negotiate a way out of Brexit, and she was similarly diplomatic when asked what she thought about the tournament not seeding Serena Williams on her return to slams after winning the 2017 Australian Open, and now the proud mother of Alexis Olympia.Although not a great one for analysing the draw (she didn’t even know it had been made on Thursday evening), Konta appeared pleased when told she was not in the American’s section – and that Williams was vying in the first week with Garbiñe Muguruza, Svetlana Kuznetsova and Maria Sharapova in a quality charge at the semis.Williams starts against Krystina Pliskova and looks on course for a fourth-round meeting with Sharapova – who surprised a few people in Rome last week when she supported a review of the WTA rules to seedings and long absences.“Wow, it’s a very strong quarter,” Konta said. “There are no easy matches any more, regardless of who you play. We’ve had plenty of proof through the last number of years that there are going to be upsets, there are going to be new breakthroughs, there are going to be oohs and aahs and all that. Whatever match you play, whatever quarter you’re in, you’ve got your work cut out for you.”Konta, still with her diplomat’s hat on, refused to be drawn on the topic of the week: whether or not Williams should be seeded here, after a long absence from the Tour.“It’s important to remember that there were mothers previously, such as Kim Clijsters, who came back and who weren’t seeded. It’s an ongoing conversation. I think it’s important to find a good balance of rewarding the current players who have earned their right to be a seed and also supporting returning mothers.”And what would that good balance be? Smiling, she replied, “It’s a good question. Honestly, I don’t quite know. I think seeding is on a player’s current form.“It would also be unfair of a player who is coming back being put into that position as well, as well as the players who are currently playing but you are taking that away if they’ve earned it.”Konta, ranked 22 in the world after a long spell in the top 10, needs a good run in this tournament and is confident she can finally do it.“This year, preparation-wise, I’ve had some really great matches on the clay. I feel like I’m playing to my level in general, regardless of surface. I’m playing better and better. So I’m hoping to continue that here.“I back myself in every way to be able to go deep into the tournament, go on to the end – but it starts with the first round.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddabdb74b812ed6c3ff2c4b6c90a6a8a61fe051c/0_99_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dd21050ad3ea78ab9d669c387771b07","title":"rugby union premiership final saracens exeter schalk brits","story":"The ‘Peter Pan’ of north London rugby is planning to celebrate whatever the result of Saturday’s Premiership final against Exeter at TwickenhamSchalk Brits will be celebrating win, lose or draw after Saturday’s Premiership final. The South African hooker brings the curtain down on nine remarkable years with Saracens after yet another final, before beginning another career in finance, starting with a masters degree at Oxford.He admits the doubts of whether he may have a bit more rugby left in him have been surfacing more than usual of late – at the start of the season he was described as “Peter Pan” by his director of rugby – but it is not a decision the 37-year-old seems to regret.Just this week there was another offer from a different club but his final outing at Twickenham provides him with the chance to sign off with a fairytale ending. It is the measure of the man, however, that he will not let his season, or his career, be defined by one match. “It’s never been part of our makeup, we don’t focus on winning, we try to make memories,” he said. “It would be nice to finish on a high note, but if we don’t, as long as we try our best we’ll still celebrate a great season with great memories.”Brits, despite his still remarkable form, continuing to redefine the limits of what a hooker is capable of with ball in hand, gives the impression that matches on a weekend are secondary to what he wants to take out of rugby. Asked what his best memories from his time in north London are, it is not European or Premiership finals that spring to mind. Rather the notorious team-bonding trips undertaken by Saracens to far-flung places such as Bermuda, Barcelona, the Alps or Oktoberfest.Brits has been named on the bench against Exeter but he is sure to play a key role – Mark McCall would be crazy not to introduce him as the game breaks up in the second half, not least considering how he performed at Twickenham on the opening weekend of the season against Northampton. It is Jamie George who gets the nod at hooker though, and he has questioned whether Exeter will feel the strain of arriving as the defending champions. Exeter contest their third straight final at Twickenham, having struggled in their first, two years ago against Saracens, going down 28-20. Having beaten Wasps last year, however, they are a different animal but George believes they could find being champions rather than challengers a trickier proposition. “Exeter might feel a little bit more pressure, we’ve wanted to have a shot at Exeter in one of these big games since last season so it’s nice to be given the opportunity,” said George.McCall is boosted by being able to name an unchanged starting XV from the side that defeated Wasps 57-33 – which means Billy Vunipola starts at No8 – but he acknowledges his side must improve defensively if they are to get their hands back on the trophy. “It is obviously something we were not happy about,” he said. “But we also think it is something we can correct and fix. We are a good defensive team, we all know that, but something like that happening the week before the final and getting away with it is probably not a bad thing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7cd4d40bda1399bb7da96ff53030db3cad2d53c/66_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac7385fed759b2ecc3f8cbe4b5f26132","title":"sun sea and the open road an american fly drive for beach fans","story":"Want an ocean drive? Visit some of the best beaches in the world with a trip to Miami, San Diego and Los AngelesStop 1: Miami, FloridaIf your idea of holiday heaven is the sand between your toes and sea breeze in your hair, then this trip to the US is a shore thing. Start by flying into the ultimate beach city of Miami. From the pastel buildings and teeny-weeny bikinis of South Venice to the rugged scenery and bike trails of Key Biscayne, Miami gives famously good – and varied – beach action.Mid Beach, MiamiIf the thongs and flash cars of South Beach get a bit too much, then Mid Beach – just a few miles north – is where Miami’s stylish scenesters hang out. For the full Club Tropicana experience, The Miami Beach Edition hotel has indoor and outdoor pools, a bowling alley, an ice-skating rink and cocktails served in bronze pineapples. Although sadly the song lied – the drinks aren’t free. What does come gratis is scoping out all the nearby art deco architecture which lines Collins Avenue and Ocean Drive.Bill Baggs Cape Florida state park, Key BiscayneKey Biscayne (known as “the key” to locals) feels like you’re escaping the city to an island oasis, even though it’s just a short drive over the bridge (hire a car from Avis for the ride). Bill Baggs is the beach for secluded sunbathing, cycling, kayaking, windsurfing and views of the Miami skyline. Pop into the mid-19th-century Cape Florida Lighthouse (ancient by US standards) and catch a glimpse of Stiltsville, a collection of historic homes that appear to float above the bay. Lighthouse Cafe, right on the shore, is the spot for a cold beer and a fish supper. Surfside, Miami BeachThis sleepy little beach town was where the Hollywood elite hung out in the 1930s, and it now hosts community picnics on the sand and street food trucks on the third Thursday of every month. The restaurants in town represent Miami’s melting pot of cultures, from the duck fat matzo ball soup at Josh’s Deli to the spaghetti at Cafe Ragazzi. The Grand Beach Hotel Surfside has a rooftop pool with sunset views, and suites where the coast is so close you could reach out and build a sandcastle.Stop 2: San Diego, California With its year-round sunshine and more than 70 miles of beaches, the southernmost tip of California is just a five-hour flight from Miami with American Airlines. Swim, surf, sunbathe or just soak up some southern-Californian vibes.La Jolla CoveTucked between sandstone cliffs, this white sand gem gives way to a deep aquamarine bay, where snorkellers and scuba ers can explore sea caves, underwater canyons and more marine life than a Nemo movie – the area is protected by the San Diego La Jolla underwater park ecological reserve. Just north of the cove is La Jolla proper, a mile-long stretch of sand known for its gentle breaks, making it an ideal beach for learning how to surf or stand-up paddleboard (also known as Sup). CoronadoThis dreamy stretch of sand at the tip of the peninsula is regularly featured on the best beaches in the US lists. The Hotel del Coronado (“The Del”) is the ultimate wooden beach house – with fairytale turrets, and was the setting for Some Like It Hot, filmed there in 1958. If some like it cooler, you can always take a break from the glorious sunshine by strolling down to the boutique shops, galleries and museum on Orange Avenue.Pacific BeachWhether at a beachside bonfire or in one of the many bars and clubs, “PB” is where San Diego’s surfer dudes and students hang out. The boardwalk is full of rollerbladers and skateboarders, and there are more restaurants and bars here than you can shake your surf wax at. Kono’s Cafe is a brunch institution, and SandBar claims to have the best fish tacos in San Diego (and recently won second place for the best fish tacos in the whole of California) – which is saying something.Stop 3: Los Angeles, CaliforniaRenting a car from Avis and driving two hours up the coast on the legendary Pacific Coast Highway to Los Angeles rewards roadtrippers with beautiful beach stop-offs along the way. Explore the upscale areas of Laguna and Newport Beach (all your fantasies of The OC brought to life) and don’t miss Crystal Cove, where Beaches was filmed in 1988, to get you in the mood for La La Land.Venice BeachFrom the Arnie-alikes pumping iron at Muscle Beach and the acrobatical break dancers, to the influencers posing for selfies in front of street art – there’s never a dull moment in Venice Beach. And despite tech companies such as Snapchat moving to town, the area’s bohemian, eclectic vibe remains as distinctive and enthralling as the smell of incense on the boardwalk. Stay in nearby Santa Monica at the stylish Shutters on the Beach, which has a copy of Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea in every room.Manhattan BeachLess than five miles south of LAX airport, Manhattan Beach has two miles of beaches with sand so fine that developers exported it to Waikiki Beach in the 1920s. Perfect your spike at the volleyball nets, or stroll down the wooden pier to check out the free aquarium. Grab lunch at the seafood shack Fishing With Dynamite – it’s delicious.MalibuThis area is known for A-list homes and some of the finest beaches in LA. Head to Zuma Beach for a surf lesson from Malibu Makos Surf Club or go outdoor rock climbing on the bluffs with Rock N Rope Adventures. Make a reservation to tour the Eames House, Charles and Ray’s home, or just sit and watch the seals and dolphins from Point Dume.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6ccb0223a80e7ec1baf93ac35a222e693ae87f1/0_0_5600_3362/master/5600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95b13522b048658e5e37328576103cce","title":"deep south sounds the ultimate music geeks playlist","story":"Take an aural trip through the southern states of the US – arguably the birthplace of country, rock‘n’roll, jazz and blues – and you’ll be hankering to visit the south for realA musical journey through the deep south is a melodious thing, and I should know – I did a trip there myself with a newly acquired husband, seven years ago, for our amazing honeymoon. How lucky we were. The music of Louisiana, Tennessee and Georgia provides an incredible trip through the rich history of the US, exploring the way Americans express themselves through jazz, soul, country, pop and blues. Even though I’m now an old married soul, these tunes still resound loudly in my life, and I want to jump on a plane every time I hear them.We start with a blast in New Orleans, and the life-affirming noise of the brilliant Rebirth Brass Band.

Catch them at their regular haunt, the Maple Leaf, as I did, and you won’t be disappointed.

She laid the groundwork for later Nashville-made stars such as Dolly Parton, Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift, and her lyrics are impressively forthright to boot: “Too many times married men think they’re still single,” she burrs.The first ever rock‘n’roll song was also made in Tennessee, down the Interstate 40 in Memphis. Rocket 88 was credited to Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats, but the band were actually Ike Turner’s (who the world would know more of later). Their song jangles and shudders like the promise of a new dawn. The first song about rock‘n’roll fame came from the south too – enter Louisiana boy Johnny B Goode. He lives “among the evergreens”, Chuck Berry tells us, and plays his guitar down by the railroad track his mum says someday he’ll be the leader of “a big old band”, and the song’s still so thrilling, you believe her. A few years later, a white boy from Tupelo came to Memphis too soon after, Elvis Presley was a worldwide sensation. Memphis, Tennessee is about a longing for home that has a sad twist in its tale, but the tune has a wiggle in its hips, as do Presley’s vocals. Staying in Memphis with Stax Records – one of America’s most supreme soul labels – it’s Sam and Dave, and what is arguably the greatest song they ever released, Soul Man.A quick dash across states follows, with Ray Charles and Georgia On My Mind. His 1960 single is even more moving when you realise he’s talking about his home (although the 1930 original was written by Hoagy Carmichael and Stuart Gorrell about Carmichael’s sister, Georgia). The south can be intriguingly rural too. Georgia boys R.E.M. made Automatic for the People in New Orleans, and their gorgeous instrumental named after the city is full of Louisiana’s heady strangeness. Then we zip back to their old friends, the B-52s, “heading down the Atlanta highway” to find their Love Shack. A party spirit thrives on open roads of the south, and it’s here in spades – and in squeals.Next, we venture into downtown Atlanta, where so many rappers made their names. Elevators (Me \u0026amp You) tells the story of how Outkast made it in the city, years before international fame hit with Hey Ya! Another tale of how the south leaves you wanting more, Tennessee Song, comes from contemporary country star Margo Price, who’s signed to Jack White’s Third Eye Records in Nashville. We finish our journey with one of today’s greatest pop stars, Atlanta’s Janelle Monae, who reminds us how America’s rock‘n’roll spirit lives on in our time. Play all these songs loud. You’ll probably fall in love too.For more inspiration and to book your trip to the US, visit bausa"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6879000477c0ab44aa2bca711109e2f664bd82f/0_556_1052_631/master/1052.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba59a716bf003134105d24a7dc50dfd8","title":"traces of opioids found in mussels in seattle bay","story":"Scientists have discovered an opioid pain reliever in mussels and say its likely other marine life are also affectedScientists who track pollution have discovered traces of the pain reliever oxycodone in some mussels in Seattle’s Puget Sound.Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife obtained clean mussels from Penn Cove on Whidbey Island and put them in different areas to test for water contamination, KIRO-TV reported this week.Scientists worked with the Puget Sound Institute to analyse the data and discovered three out of 18 locations came back positive for trace amounts of oxycodone.Two were near the historic naval shipyard district and one was in Elliot Bay near Harbour Island in Seattle.Puget Sound Institute scientist Andy James, who assisted with the study, said the areas where the oxycodone-tainted mussels were sampled are considered highly urbanised and are not near commercial shellfish beds.He also said the oxycodone was found in amounts thousands of times lower than a therapeutic dose for humans.Scientists usually find chemical compounds in Puget Sound waters, ranging from pharmaceuticals to drugs such as cocaine, but this is the first time that opioids have been discovered in local shellfish, according to the Puget Sound Institute.“It’s telling me there’s a lot of people taking oxycodone in the Puget Sound area,” said State Fish and Wildlife biologist Jennifer Lanksbury, who leads the monitoring studies.The contamination is likely coming through wastewater treatment plants, she said, adding that the chemicals may be having an impact on fish and shellfish in those areas.“Hopefully our data shows what’s out there and can get the process started for cleaning up our waters,” she said.She says mussels at a restaurant or store are healthy because they come from clean locations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f35cf4b786e8c38da4308c3a9ec3232e10538979/0_17_4314_2588/master/4314.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6308b679e5bd5b9e99fb3fec31b53229","title":"champagne populists far right meps face inquiry into expenses","story":"Report claims €427,000 in ‘noncompliant’ expenses included 234 bottles of bubblyRail as they might against Europe being a waste of taxpayers’ money, it seems Europe’s far-right populists are not above wasting some of it themselves.Senior MEPs will discuss next week claims that the Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) group received €427,000 in “unreasonable” and “noncompliant” expenses for 2016, including for €400-a-head meals and a total of 234 bottles of champagne.The parliament’s budget control committee recommended in March that the group, made up of MEPs mainly from France’s far-right Front National, Italy’s League, Austria’s Freedom party and the Dutch Party for Freedom, must be made to repay the money.The committee’s report said the sum was made up of €38,889 of expenses that could not be justified, and €388,278 which violated EU tendering rules. It included Christmas presents worth more than €100 each and wines at €81 a bottle. The group’s expenditure was “unacceptable”, the committee’s chair, Ingeborg Grässle, told Agence France-Presse. The expenses were “neither reasonable nor compatible with the principles of sound financial management”. Legitimate parliamentary expenses can be claimed for staff, translators, office supplies, phone and internet costs as well as for some entertainment, but strict conditions must be observed, which the ENF “repeatedly disregarded”, the committee said.The ENF’s co-chair, the Front National MEP Nicolas Bay, has rejected the allegations, saying the group had not “deliberately ignored the regulations” and the problem arose because the rules for public tenders were not easy to interpret.The leaders of the European parliament’s political groups are due to discuss the issue at a meeting on Monday amid calls for it to be debated in plenary session and the ENF’s repeated insistence that it has done nothing wrong. The Front National leader, Marine Le Pen, has already been placed under formal investigation in France over allegations that her party illegally claimed millions of euros from the European parliament to pay for France-based staff.That case was also triggered by a complaint from the European parliament stemming from the same investigation into the ENF’s alleged abuse of EU funds, accusing the Front National of wholesale fraud. The inquiry by the European parliament watchdog established that between 2011 and 2012, Le Pen had illicitly paid party staff in France using money that should only be used for MEPs to pay assistants for legislative tasks.Le Pen is one of 17 Front National MEPs – along with her estranged father, Jean-Marie Le Pen – who are being investigated over salaries paid to about 40 parliamentary assistants.

We have nothing to do with it whatsoever. This is the inner matter of the UK,” Putin said.“And I guess we can suspect that those who wanted the UK to leave the EU are Russian agents,” he added, noting that the foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, was among those campaigning to leave the European Union.“If they want to worsen their relationships with Russia they can blame all their mortal sins on us and this is actually the case nowadays,” Putin said. “Brexit, and Catalonia and the Skripal case, God knows what – and this plane again.”Putin’s comments to the heads of international news agencies on the margins of the St Petersburg International Economic Forum, follow a statement by Johnson backing international demands for Russia to be held accountable for the fate of MH17, the Malaysian Airlines flight downed over war-torn eastern Ukraine nearly four years ago killing all 298 people on board. In a statement, Johnson said the incident, which claimed the lives of 10 British nationals, was “an egregious example of the Kremlin’s disregard for innocent life”. “The Kremlin believes it can act with impunity,” he said. “The Russian government must now answer for its actions in relation to the downing of MH17. “The UK fully supports Australia and the Netherlands in their request to the Russian Federation to accept state responsibility, and to cooperate with them in their efforts to deliver justice for the victims of this tragedy. “Instead of seeking to undermine the investigation through the deluge of disinformation we have seen from Russia about MH17 in the past, the Russian Federation must fulfil its obligations under UN security council resolution 2166 to provide any requested assistance to the investigation. “To do otherwise would be a violation of the UN’s resolution, and to deny the families the justice they seek for their loved ones.” Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected the MH17 findings, saying Russia had been barred from taking part in the investigation and did not trust its results.The Russian defence ministry said the missile “more than likely” came from Ukrainian arsenals.

Photograph: Clodagh KilcoyneReutersThis exit poll provides the first understanding of how Ireland has voted in the referendum on the Eighth Amendment. It finds that 68 per cent have voted in favour of repeal, with 32 per cent voting against.The exit poll was conducted yesterday among 4,501 voters as they left the polling stations. Voters were randomly selected at 160 stations across the country from Achill Island off Co Mayo to Dublin city centre, and from the northern tip of Donegal to southwest Cork. Those selected were asked to complete a mock ballot paper replicating how they had just voted. They also provided their gender and age, so that the exit poll can provide not only an indication of the overall result, but also allows us to understand the differences in voting patterns across different population groups.The expectation in the lead up to this referendum was that younger voters and those living in Dublin would strongly support repeal, while the vote among older voters and those living in rural areas would be more split. It was suggested that the success of the Yes campaign was strongly dependent on a high turnout of these younger voters. support for repeal has a broad base, with a majority in most age groups voting in favour. The anticipated pattern of stronger support among younger voters has materialised, with 87 per cent of those aged 18- 24 voting in favour of repeal, compared with 40 per cent of those aged 65 and older.While both men and women have voted in favour of repeal – and by comfortable margins in both cases – the strength of the Yes vote was much higher among women. Seventy per cent of women have voted in favour of repeal, compared with 65 per cent of men. Within each age group the majority of both men and women have voted in favour of repeal. As was anticipated, women aged 25 and under showed the highest levels of support – 90 per cent voted in favour.Support for repeal is higher in Dublin than other parts of the country. Seventy-seven per cent of those in Dublin have voted in favour compared with 64 per cent in other parts of the country. Support for repeal was lowest in the Connacht-Ulster region, but still the majority of voters there – 59 per cent – voted in favour.The consensus throughout polling day was that the turnout was relatively high. While an exit poll cannot measure turnout, it does provide an understanding of the profile of voters. Voting behaviour is typically habitual. Those who have voted in the past will most likely vote again in the future. There is little empirical evidence – in Ireland or internationally – that previous elections or referendums have been swung by an upsurge in votes from a group that traditionally do not go to the polls.Comparing the profile of those voting yesterday to that in our exit poll for the general election in 2016 suggests a small uplift in the proportion of votes cast by those aged 25 and under. Of all votes cast yesterday, 9 per cent were by those aged 25 or under. This compares with 7 per cent in the general election in 2016. However, those aged 65 and older remain a much larger voting bloc, and for every vote cast yesterday by those aged 25 and under there were two votes cast by those aged 65 and older.Those suggesting that the outcome of this referendum rests solely on the engagement of younger voters should be mindful that there were as many votes cast yesterday in favour of repeal by those aged 65 and older than by those aged 25 and under. These results are a clear indication of a resounding vote in favour of repeal. However, how reliable are exit polls? Can this poll accurately anticipate the result before a single vote is counted?Firstly, it is important to recognise that exit polls are entirely different from pre-election polling in that they record actual voting behaviour as opposed to asking about voting intention. This eliminates the uncertainty that exists with pre-election polls. There are no undecided voters. There is no need to distinguish between likely voters and those who do not vote despite telling the pollster that they will.However, that is not to suggest that exit polls are themselves without challenges. Quite the opposite, they involve incredibly complex design. Accurate polling is built upon the foundation of a sample that represents all voters. Establishing these foundations involves a recipe with very precise measurements. There is a long list of ingredients: The number of voters registered at each polling station the proportion of these that will vote the pattern of voting trends across the day the ever-changing voter profile as the day progresses. Very limited information exists on which to make decisions on study design. The overall turnout figure for each constituency is published, however, there is only limited reliable information on how this differs across different polling stations. Exit polls need to be conducted within a very short period of time – voting happens over a 15-hour period. They also need to be published as quickly as possible after polls close – in this case within moments of the polls closing. This is not easy when there is typically a spike in voting during the few short hours before polls close.In spite of these challenges exit polls are highly predictive of the result. The exit poll conducted by Ipsos MRBI on behalf of The  for the 2016 general election accurately reflected the actual vote share obtained by each political party.With all this in mind we can be highly confident that Ireland has voted to repeal the Eighth Amendment. While this outcome may have felt inevitable in recent days, the magnitude of the vote in favour of repeal – and the high levels of support across different groups of voters – will come as some surprise to those on both sides of this campaign.

Photograph: Will OliverEPAProposals that the UK would use the Irish “backstop” provisions in Britain as well as Northern Ireland after Brexit will simply not be acceptable, the EU told British negotiators at talks in Brussels this week.A senior EU official on Thursday night described the proposals from prime minister Theresa May as a “fantasy”.The UK is proposing to maintain regulatory alignment with the whole of the EU for a limited period after transition out of the EU to avoid cutting the North off from the rest of the UK and to obviate the necessity for a border on the Irish Sea.But its negotiators were told during three days of talks here that “regulatory alignment was not available on an all-UK basis”, because it would mean a form of cherry-picking and a breach of fundamental single market rules.And the UK could not be allowed simply to commit to joint all-UK customs controls on a “time-limited basis” because they would “undermine the whole purpose of the guarantee”.The EU official warned that progress on the Irish border – “let alone substantive progress” – was proving “elusive”.The UK is suggesting the withdrawal agreement protocol and its backstop guarantee should include an assumption that an eventual alternative arrangement will be agreed for frictionless borders between the UK and the EU as a whole. But if such an agreement is not forthcoming, officials here say, there must be the backstop provisions to fall back on. Time-limiting their application would remove that guarantee.In the Northern Ireland strand of the discussions, they had made progress on issues such as the single electricity market, and VAT rules, but had not discussed the “crunch” issues of the Border, regulatory alignment and customs.The issue was raised, however, by the UK team in the discussion on the future relationshiptrade agreement, where they said that Ms May was determined to implement the backstop on an all-UK basis “through the overall EU-UK relationship”.The EU team said that the “backstop must be Northern Ireland-specific”.“We have to do away with the fantasy that there is an all-UK solution to this,” the senior official said.A senior official described the talks on the full range of Brexit issues, from Northern Ireland to the future relationship, as frustrating, observing that: “To paraphrase The Leopard by Tomasi di Lampedusa, I have the impression that the UK thinks everything has to change on the EU’s side so that everything can stay the same for the UK.”The  reported senior sources at the Brexit department, however, rejecting the suggestion that Brussels had dismissed the UK’s new backstop plan, suggesting that it was “simply a negotiating position” and that they believed the EU was open to the idea. “It’s a public stance for them to take during the negotiation,” one said.A No 10 source added: “This is what they do every time. As usual we’ve heard it all before. There’s nothing they’ve said which concerns us.”In their discussions of an overall trade deal, the UK rejected the suggestion from the EU of a free trade pact, and pressed their demands for a generalised system of mutual recognition and managed ergence. EU officials said that a system of mutual recognition, however, would not be available outside the single market – it would require higher external levels of trust than internally.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3508852.1527281263!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord yes yes yes a resounding emphatic yes","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPresident Michael D Higgins and his wife Sabina casting their votes in the referendum on the Eighth Amendment at St Mary’s Hospital in the Phoenix Park. Photograph: Cyril Byrne Yes, Yes, Yes. A resounding, emphatic Yes. And what a way to say it – the only way to say it: with conviction and clarity. This massive vote to repeal the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution leaves no doubt. The Irish people have taken ownership of their abortion issue. They have taken it out of the hands of unrepresentative lobby groups and celibate clerics and decided how they want to approach it.On Friday, with steely assurance, a new generation of all the generations faced down the suffocating old certainties and swept them aside. On Friday, May 25th, 2018, they stood up and were not afraid to be counted. Because those days are gone now.The official result has yet to be declared, but the exit polls point only in one direction, and it is going to be a monumental change and a major milestone in modern Irish history.You could feel it in the air in the last week of the referendum campaign. Something had changed and something big was about to happen. It was there in the faces of the younger people – out there agitating, unashamed to be seeking basic rights for Irish women, because they were in the right.It was there in the noncommittal comments of older men and women. People misinterpreted them as the words of No voters who didn’t fancy being ridiculed for bucking a liberal trend. Instead, they were merely keeping their counsel and waiting to have their say.Thirty-five years is a long time to wait for a isive and dangerous clause to be excised from the Constitution. But for those who waited decades to see those lines equating the life of a foetus from conception to its living, breathing mother, the 15 hours it would take for the nation to vote probably felt like a lifetime.There couldn’t have been a better day for a vote. The sun shone on the island, welcoming back the thousands of men and women who traversed the globe and returned to vote. The sight of them arriving at ports and airports with their “Repeal” jumpers and wheelie cases moved the most hard-hearted observers to tears.These where the children of the women who had no choice, returning home from far-flung places and bringing back the gift of choice.All day, up and down the country, the voters streamed into polling stations, exceeding turnout expectations from early morning. The huge number of young people, young women in particular, many with babies and toddlers, did the heart good. You could sense the mood of charge in their faces as they came into the polling stations, anxiously scanning the tables, eager to hand over their cards.“I was torn, but I voted for my daughters,” said one women.“We were only exporting the problem,” said her husband.The Taoiseach voted in his local school in Castleknock. Scoil Thomáis was swarming with photographers when Leo Varadkar arrived.He said he was confident.“The lads at my gym all told me they are voting Yes.”Many more were in rural locations around the State. These were the men and women from the big international photo agencies, hoping to capture the image of Catholic Ireland voting away the vestiges of church authority from their private lives.The presiding officer in Knock had to tell them to leave. With its shrine and place as the pilgrimage capital of Ireland, they descended on the Mayo village in the search of voting nuns, but they were unsuccessful. They had been told there was a big mural of the Blessed Virgin in Knock, but that has been painted over. They were most annoyed.If the smiling women and the reticent men and the huge numbers voting in Dublin and other major urban areas was an indicator of rapidly gathering change, there were worries in more rural areas.“The voting is very brisk, but everyone is very elderly. I think they’re being bussed in. I’d be worried,” said an acquaintance in Roscommon.But everywhere the change was happening.As the day wore on, and the figures climbed, the staying hand of pious history was always there in the background. There have been disappointments before. Powerful interests who exert huge influence in Irish political and social life were not going to lightly give up the fight.In the headquarters of Together for\u0026nbspYes, they had run out of posters and people were offering to walk the city streets wearing sandwich boards. Minister for Health Simon Harris called in to see them for the first time.Artwork along one wall of their offices – quieter than ever they have been in the last three months – had a quote from WB Yeats: “Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire.”Education is the enemy of those who would work to keep Irish men and women slaves to a dark past.The volunteers were optimistic, and a little teary. But, sure, who wasn’t.They recounted trips to the airport to welcome those who were home to vote. One overseas camera crew was trying to find a No\u0026nbspvoter to balance their report. They couldn’t, until somebody noticed a plane from Medjugorje was due in.They waited for the passengers to come through and finally came up with three people who would be voting No.Yes, the signs were there. Driving into town, groups of volunteers gathered on roundabouts were being cheered and beeped by passing motorists. Joggers gave the thumbs-up. But on a flyover, a group of anti-abortion campaigners were getting nothing from the cars travelling below.The Taoiseach wore his little Yes\u0026nbspbadge on his lapel. He said in the Dáil during the week that if there is a vote for repeal “Ireland will still be the same country it was before the vote. It will just be a little bit more compassionate.”And some who have been around since 1983 will be a little bit more emotional.\u0026nbspOur morning started with a trip to the Phoenix Park to see Michael D Higgins vote.\u0026nbspThe then senator Michael D was fiercely opposed to the “callous” referendum on the Eighth Amendment in 1983, when he was president of the Labour Party.\u0026nbspHe said the TDs promoting it were “monumental in their hypocrisy” and then quoted Michael Davitt: “If the Irish had a weakness worse than drink, it was moral cowardice.” Not anymore.\u0026nbspAfter he voted, he got into his car and prepared to leave. Then he saw me and got out again, striding over to say hello. We shook hands and there was a little embrace and kiss from Sabina.I told him it was all getting a little too much and I was so glad to see him.\u0026nbspThe President said he misses meeting a lot of people he used to see.\u0026nbspI mentioned that 1983 speech and all the things he said and wrote back then.

I hope they understand that message and I hope that we can make very rapid progress on that,” Mr Corbyn declared in Derry.“It is impossible to go through a period so crucial as Brexit negotiations without a voice for Northern Ireland being made at the table by the political classes in NI,” he told Derry Chamber of Commerce.The local economy in Derry “depends absolutely” on the ability of local businesses to travel freely across the Border with the Republic, said the Labour leader, on the second day of a visit to NI.“The idea of a hard Border is impossible to conceive that it would do anything other than seriously damage this area and damage the life-chances of people in this area in a place which has already suffered.“Any kind of border, physical border, virtual reality border, technological border, whatever, would be very damaging to the economy,” he said, sharply criticising the performance of Conservative prime minister, Theresa May. Emphasising that he wanted to see a Brexit deal that protects jobs across the United Kingdom, Mr Corbyn yet again favoured a customs deal with the European Union and continued tariff-free access after it leaves.Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee welcomed Mr Corbyn’s commitment to avoid a hard border.She repeated the Government’s call for the British government to agree to a “legally operable text” around the backstop option post-Brexit that keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the European Union’s customs union and single market in the event of no alternative proposal to maintain an invisible border.“Our preferred option continues to be the closest possible relationship and any proposals to that effect are welcome but the backstop must be dealt with separately it would ensure no border or related customs checks or controls in the absence of a close relationship,” she told The .“Irrespective of Mr Corbyn’s comments the British government must still come forward with the proposals on the backstop and we need to see sufficient progress on this by the June European Council. I remain optimistic that this can happen.”During his time in Derry and Belfast, Mr Corbyn heard mounting concerns about the post-Brexit existence of the Border and, indeed, concerns about the wider Brexit exit deal.Under a “backstop” deal reached last December, Northern Ireland would continue to follow EU regulations necessary to ensure that no hard Border is needed, though this deal is increasingly being questioned now by leading British Cabinet members.“Crucial decisions are going to be made in the next three months, and I understand very clearly the message that you have given me here this morning,” he told his audience.Meanwhile, the Labour leader said the situation where unelected civil servants have had to take major policy decisions because of the lack of the NI Executive and Assembly cannot continue.“It is unconscionable that you have civil servants making major decisions, then challenged by the courts, with elected politicians having no say whatsoever,” he declared.Welcoming the Labour leader, the president of Derry’s Chamber of Commerce, Jennifer McKeever, said Derry is “the city at the heart of the Brexit conundrum”.Delivering a strong message that 90 per cent of local businesses want to stay in the European Union’s customs union and single market, she said they serve two counties, two countries, two jurisdictions.“Every day, thousands of us cross the Border for work, for education, for health and for trade. The EU is not a foreign, far-away bureaucracy – it’s a couple of miles from where we sit. “It’s where many of our staff live and where we find our customers and trading partners. Everybody accepts that it would be unacceptable to reintroduce a hard Border in Ireland.”However, she warned that it is “infinitely more difficult to understand” the declarations from London politicians that the UK “can pull out of the customs union and single market” and avoid a hard Border.“The truth is we just cannot see how you can square this circle: to both leave the EU and to ensure no Border – to create the unique solution for NI Ireland and to do it without damaging our peace and prosperity.”Speaking directly to Mr Corbyn, she said the customs union and single market offer a market of 500 million people: “It’s under those conditions that we have built the business community that you are sitting with this morning.”Warning that local patience is “wearing thin”, she insisted that the British government’s favoured options of a customs partnership, or a technological deal to solve Border issues do not “inspire confidence”.Urging more British politicians to visit Northern Ireland, Bonnie Anley, the chair of Foyle Port, said it is “vital” that they “experience and see” the day-to-day realities that are now facing local firms.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea volcano pictures","story":"Kilauea volcano has created nearly two dozen lava-shooting fissures on Hawaii\u0027s Big Island since the eruption began, spewing lava and emitting toxic gases.Thousands have been forced to evacuate their homes and experts remain unsure of where more of the hazardous cracks might open up, or when the volcanic activity might stop.The eruption of Kilauea volcano in Hawaii sparked new safety warnings about toxic gas on the Big Island\u0027s southern coastline after lava began flowing into the ocean and setting off a chemical reaction.Abortion referendum exit poll results trigger calls for Northern Ireland to follow suitAfghan interpreter scheme fails to relocate any to safety in UK, report findsDonald Trump hails \u0026#39very productive talks with North Korea\u0026#39 amid signs Kim Jong-un summit could go aheadDonald Trump says ZTE will pay $1.3bn fine and provide \u0026#39high-level security guarantees\u0026#39 to resume businessWounded Indiana teacher \u0026#39ran towards bullets\u0026#39 as he stopped school shooterObese people should start work later to avoid rush hour crush, government advisor saysComment: SNP\u0026#39s monster report on independence is much ado about nothingAdding iodine to salt could help children reach full academic potentialMatilda the Musical moves start time to 7pm as audiences say they want to hit the town afterwardsHugh Grant finally ties knot at 57 as he marries Swedish girlfriend Anna Eberstein Dispatch: Emotions run high as bitter ides are laid bare in Ireland\u0026#39s abortion referendum Comment: SNP currency proposals  \u0026#39disastrous\u0026#39 for an independent Scotland\u0026#39s economyComment: The monarchy reaches parts politics cannot reach – it should stay that wayRoy of the Rovers for the modern age: star gets flash haircut, million pound contract and hints of transferSri Lanka groundsman: ‘Make sure England Test ends within four days?

If we can reach our target of 1bn, then potentially it is the next biggest thingHowarth Bouis, a US economistImportantly, they have been created through traditional breeding techniques rather than being genetically modified which means they can be planted without waiting for regulatory approval.“The first green revolution reached at least one billion people and was a huge success. If we can reach our target of one billion, then potentially it is the next biggest thing,” said Howarth Bouis, a US economist whose organisation HarvestPlus has received £87.4m from Dfid to breed and distribute crop varieties fortified with Vitamin A, Iron and Zinc.About 30 million people – around six million households – have so far benefited from the new crops, primarily in Africa, but the aim is to reach one billion by 2030. A further six million farmers in Asia are using scuba rice but the aim is 18 million by 2028.Scientists believe that if they achieve the one billion target they will effectively halve the world’s estimated two billion suffering from what is known as “hidden hunger” or micronutrient malnutrition.The first green revolution, which occurred in the early to mid 1900s, won its instigator Norman Borlaug a Nobel Peace Prize and spawned disease-resistant, high-yielding wheat strains which are credited with saving 250 million lives worldwide.Agricultural breakthroughs trump medical innovations such as antibiotics and vaccinations for lives saved historically because food is so central to life.It is estimated one million children a year die from micronutrient malnutrition which leaves them prone to stunted growth, poor vision and illnesses and diseases that have the potential to become worldwide epidemics.Agronomist Norman Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 in recognition of his contributions to world peace through increasing food supplyThe new super-crops not only replicate the traits of the first green revolution in having higher yields but also have been – or are being – cross-bred further to incorporate genes that protect from disease, pests, floods, drought and heat.“Our centres are developing climate adaptive crops. Farmers like them not only because they are climate tolerant but also high yielding. We just need to get them into mainstream markets and piggy back on them with our vitamin strains,” said Bouis.For the “heat-beater” beans, a staple in Rwanda where the fortified varieties provide up to half a person’s recommended daily intake of iron, scientists in Colombia trawled a gene bank of 36,000 samples to find a Mexican strain capable of withstanding temperature rises expected over the next century due to climate change.Biofortification | Super-crops heralding the next green revolutionIt will not only safeguard the 50 per cent of land that would have been lost to farmers due to higher temperatures but could also open up new markets in tropical areas for the beans.“Even if they can only handle a three-degree rise, that would still limit the land lost to climate change to about 5 per cent,” said Steve Beebe, head of bean breeding for the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture.Scuba rice was created after scientists tracked down an Indian rice variety with a gene, SUB1A, which was activated when the plant was submerged. It was crossed with India’s top-selling, high-yielding Swarni rice to counter the annual loss of 4m tonnes of rice to flooding in India and Bangladesh, enough to feed 30m people.Dr Uma Shankar Singh, a director of the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), said: “Sustaining productivity is the most important factor and we now have six million farmers cultivating 3 million hectares. At minimum it is adding 3 million tonnes of rice. We have also developed SUB1 varieties with salt, drought and stagnant flooding tolerance.”Biofortified beans in RwandaDfid is now the biggest funder of HarvestPlus, whose work into fortified crops was started in 2003. Nottingham University professor Martin Broadley, a research fellow with Dfid, said the genesis of the programme came from research showing how expensive and inefficient it was to deliver supplements or fortified processed foods like bread to rural areas.“Upfront investment in breeding iron, vitamin A and zinc dense crops is the most cost-effective way to improve nutrition compared with other approaches,” he said.According to the World Health Organization, every $10-$15 invested in, for example, the vitamin A rich orange sweet potato produces one extra year of good quality life per inidual..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}Upfront investment in breeding iron, vitamin A and zinc dense crops is the most cost-effective way to improve nutrition compared with other approachesProfessor Martin Broadley, Nottingham UniversityHarvestPlus deliberately spurned genetic modification in favour of natural methods. “If we’d invested our money in GM, they could have been left sitting on the shelf. Conventional breeding is not as powerful a science but at least we can do a lot of good with it without the blockages you have with transgenics,” said Bouis.Government agriculture centres and NGOs are supporting the distribution of the seeds. As it seeks to reach 1 billion, Dfid has put in an extra £4 million to get private seed producers to take up the “super-crops” and achieve the necessary increase in uptake.The roll-out of the seeds has been supported by promotions including a radio soap opera, My Children, in Uganda to advance the orange sweet potato, a rap song by Rwandan musicians to encourage use of iron-rich beans and Yellow Cassava, a Nollywood (Nigerian Hollywood) film highlighting the nutritional benefits of the vitamin A rich crop.Women clear wet mud alongside the bank of the river in Satkhira, Bangladesh. Bangladesh is one of the continental countries most vulnerable to climate change.At least 14 studies are being carried out to establish whether eating the fortified crops improve the health of the communities consuming them. The early results are encouraging.In Uganda, the orange sweet potato, taken up by 60 per cent of farms in the area studied, saw a significant increase in vitamin A uptake among families, a 9 per cent fall in those with low vitamin A and a drop of up to 19 per cent in diarrhoea among children.Children eating orange maize in Zambia saw improvements in their sight through increased vitamin A. Women given fortified beans in Rwanda reversed their iron deficiency, reducing anaemia. College students in Rwanda aged 17 to 25 who ate the beans scored significantly better in cognitive tests of memory and speed after just 18 weeks.Studies into whether eating fortified crops improves the health of the communities have yielded promising resultsA Dfid spokesman said: “Biofortification is highly cost-effective as it provides a single intervention which benefits both this generation and future generations to come. By providing farmers with seeds and planting material, they and their households can grow, sell and consume foods that are already vitamin-rich, with no need for additional supplements.“The crops remain high yielding and vitamin rich for future harvests. This compares with supplements which need to be repeated, or fortification which needs to be continuously added to food products.”More controversially, Dfid is backing one of a potential new generation of GM crops now closing in on market readiness. It is funding work on modifying plants’ photosynthetic efficiency so their water use is cut by 25 per cent by changing the expression of a single gene.A potential breakthrough has also emerged in Mozambique’s field trials of more water-efficient GM maize (WEMA). Early results suggest it is not only resistant to drought but also the devastating stem borer and fall army worm pests.Ohio State University scientists are working to create a GM “golden potato”, which would provide 42 per cent of a child’s daily vitamin A.By providing farmers with seeds and planting material, they and their households can grow, sell and consume foods that are vitamin-richUganda is trialling a “golden banana” high in vitamin A created by Australia’s Queensland University of Technology by inserting a gene from a Papua New Guinea banana into the commercially-successful Cavendish banana.It is named after William Cavendish, the sixth Duke of Devonshire, a passionate horticulturalist who developed it on his Derbyshire estate in the 19th century.Public and political scepticism, however, remains a major hurdle for GM. The salutary lesson on this is “golden rice”, a GM strain engineered to boost vitamin A. More than a decade after it was hailed as a potential game-changer, its progress to farmers’ fields has stalled in a blizzard of regulation and public opposition.If the next green revolution is to come, harnessing nature rather than genetically modifying it may prove to be quickest and most efficient route.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Abortion referendum exit poll results trigger calls for Northern Ireland to follow suitAfghan interpreter scheme fails to relocate any to safety in UK, report findsDonald Trump hails \u0026#39very productive talks with North Korea\u0026#39 amid signs Kim Jong-un summit could go aheadDonald Trump says ZTE will pay $1.3bn fine and provide \u0026#39high-level security guarantees\u0026#39 to resume businessWounded Indiana teacher \u0026#39ran towards bullets\u0026#39 as he stopped school shooterObese people should start work later to avoid rush hour crush, government advisor saysComment: SNP\u0026#39s monster report on independence is much ado about nothingAdding iodine to salt could help children reach full academic potentialMatilda the Musical moves start time to 7pm as audiences say they want to hit the town afterwardsHugh Grant finally ties knot at 57 as he marries Swedish girlfriend Anna Eberstein Dispatch: Emotions run high as bitter ides are laid bare in Ireland\u0026#39s abortion referendum Comment: SNP currency proposals  \u0026#39disastrous\u0026#39 for an independent Scotland\u0026#39s economyComment: The monarchy reaches parts politics cannot reach – it should stay that wayRoy of the Rovers for the modern age: star gets flash haircut, million pound contract and hints of transferSri Lanka groundsman: ‘Make sure England Test ends within four days?

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The scientists tracked a star about as big as our sun as it was pulled from its normal path and into that of a supermassive black hole before being eaten up. They then saw a high-speed flare get thrust out, escaping from the rim of the black hole. Scientists have seen black holes killing and swallowing stars. And the jets have been seen before.But a new study shows the first time that they have captured the hot flare that comes out just afterwards. And the flare and then swallowed star have not been linked together beforeA British scientist has uncovered the fossil of a dog-sized horned dinosaur that roamed eastern North America up to 100 million years ago. The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in AsiaBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits. Some characteristics are more common in women, while some are more common in men, and some are common in both men and women, according to the studyLife may have come to earth 4.1 billion years ago, hundreds of millions of years earlier than we knew. The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.Earth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occurScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”Illustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.As its structure is so different, the i-motif can be used as a switch when paired with regular DNA – with the two different shapes being recognised as either “on” or “off”.This has already been applied in basic nanomachine applications, and work by Dr Waller and her colleagues has expanded the repertoire of switches that can be used in such settings.By adding copper salts to DNA in oxygen-free conditions, they found DNA could be changed into an i-motif shape. This could then be further modified into another shape called a “hairpin” by adding oxygen to the mix.These results were published in the journal Nucleic Acids Research.“One of the direct applications is in DNA-based computing,” explained Dr Waller.Decoding rose DNA could allow scientists to create better flowersThe concept of DNA computing has floated around for years, with Microsoft investigating potential applications and using DNA for data storage.Some scientists have used the code of DNA to store information, or constructed simple logic gates and circuits.“You can use DNA to make logic gates and one of the advantages in using DNA is computing is that you can carry out calculations in parallel if your different types of logic gates are represented by different triggers or ingredients,” said Dr Waller.“So the fact we have discovered separate triggers for the same type of DNA means you could increase the output you could actually use.”Other technological applications of DNA include the creation of tiny “nanobots” that can deliver drugs to parts of the body.“DNA is biocompatible, so if you make a nanomachine out of DNA you can introduce it to a cell and it doesn’t get destroyed or recognised as quickly as some other agents we introduce,” said Dr Waller.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Sir Ivan Rogers, the UK’s old ambassador to the EU, was criticised after he advised ministers in 2016 that leaving the EU would take around 10 years. He stepped down from his post shortly after.The EU says under the December agreement just Northern Ireland would stay in full alignment with the single market and customs union to prevent a hard border, while UK negotiators say they actually agreed that the whole UK would do so. The relevant text is somewhat ambiguous as to what was agreed.EU officials do not want the backstop to apply to the whole UK because it would give Britain access to the single market without having to uphold the so-called “four freedom” or submitting to the European Court of Justice. The UK says it cannot accept the backstop only applying to NI because that would create a potential customs border between Great Britain and NI  – which the DUP oppose. Theresa May has relied on the DUP for her majority in the House of Commons since she called an election and lost seats last year.The time-limiting element has now been introduced by the UK because Cabinet Brexiteers like Boris Johnson fear that an indefinite backstop could be a backdoor way of keeping the UK aligned with the EU in perpetuity. Ministers have publicly confirmed that a time-limited backstop is on the way.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesBrexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

So is Her Majesty the Queen. They haven’t felt the need to label themselves as such we know from their actions.As the basic scriptwriting rule dictates, show don’t tell.To her credit, Meghan Markle championed many charitable causes that advocate female empowerment before she met Prince Harry, and no one is suggesting she shouldn’t continue with this work.But what grates about the above statement is the unsaid inference that here is a feisty, independent woman who, unshackled by pomp, ceremony and dutiful political impartiality, is going to drag the stuffy, deluded old monarchy kicking and screaming into the 21st century.That this go-get-’em gal from the US of A is going to shake things up with a few bumper-sticker sentiments and teach those Brits a thing or two about how the world works.Or perhaps we should leave it to Patrick Jephson, former private secretary to Princess Diana, a man very much in the know on the inner workings of the House of Windsor.In his book, The Meghan Factor, he says: “The one key skill Meghan absolutely must perfect is how to avoid being seen as any kind of a destabilising force. It’s a useful guideline when weighing the pros and cons of any intended course of action, from saving a local playgroup, to saving an endangered species, to saving the planet. What always comes first is saving the monarchy.”Quite. In other words, don’t get up the collective nose of the British public or they might just, ahem, pick it and flick you off into oblivion.As we saw on Saturday, as Bishop Michael Curry’s address entered what felt like its third decade, The Queen’s resolutely impassive expression suggests she’d make a fine poker player.We have no idea what she thought of it, nor Donald Trump, Brexit or the highly political Me Too campaign. She has opinions, of course. But what she doesn’t do is wear them like a badge.Just like her great-great-grandmother Victoria, who advocated “never complain, never explain”, The Queen knows the future of the monarchy lies in being a non-political figurehead who promotes national unity.Jephson adds: “If you acquire a profile, a purpose and a passionate public devotion independent of the royal mainstream, then you risk being perceived and presented as a threat to the Crown itself.”We already know what Meghan thinks about an awful lot of things, because her life so far can’t be edited.We also know that her soapbox has just got bigger thanks to her new status which, to those unused to it, could foster the corrosive misconception that everyone is hanging off your every word.Read my pursed lips: They’re not. They’re just being polite.So Meghan must learn fast that she’s a very minor cog in an ancient royal machine that has survived so long by saying nothing and doing its duty to its loyal subjects.Frustrating that may be for a “feminist” (or, indeed a manist), but that’s the trade-off for the largely taxpayer-funded life of luxury that is granted, not self-generated.As a celebrity, you can say what you like and we can choose to listen or not. But opinions divide people and, as a royal, you are supposed to represent everyone.Meghan needs to understand, and implement, that distinction sooner rather than later.HUMAN rights lawyer Amal Clooney was officially crowned “best-dressed guest” by fashionistas observing the Royal Wedding.According to one, she was “a sublime vision in marigold”, though personally speaking, Colman’s Mustard yellow might be more accurate.Either way, Ms Clooney once again proved adept at pulling focus from the other mere mortals floundering in her ever-stylish slipstream.By contrast, the Duchess of Cambridge’s understated, Alexander McQueen frock coat got a sniffier reception from certain fashion quarters, not least because she’s worn it three times before.They’re missing the point.A wedding is about the bride, not the guests.And Kate understood that perfectly by wearing something that wouldn’t propel her into the limelight on Meghan’s big day.Now that’s style.THOSE attending Chelsea Flower Show (no, me neither) have declared that “she-sheds” are the latest must-have – kitted out with radiators, chandeliers and squishy sofas.Alternatively, we could have all that inside the house and just send the other half out into the garden.AN Islamic school in Birmingham has warned female pupils against using tampons.The guidance, adopted as school policy, states: “Among the types of pads, tampons may not be appropriate due to insertion.”But the head of the school insists it has “no connection to faith”.Hmmmm. Meanwhile, it has emerged that women are having “virginity restoring” operations on the NHS at a cost of £1,000 a time.The 30-minute procedure involves the hymen – which can break after using tampons, doing sport or having sex for the first time – being stitched or reconstructed.One relationship counsellor suggested that one of the reasons was that some religious women were “over- whelmed” by feelings of sexual guilt and wanted to be “as pure as possible again” for their husband.Want to? Or are forced to by religiously driven, moral expectations not placed on the man they’re marrying?Either way, is this really something the NHS should be funding when money for other, more vital, operations is so scarce?MEMO to Sir Anthony Hopkins: Yes, families do fall out and just because you’re related doesn’t mean you have to like each other.But saying you “don’t care one way or the other” whether your 48-year-old daughter Abigail has children or not seems overly cold and perhaps partly explains your 20-year estrangement.In future, a simple, “We don’t speak and I’d rather not go in to it”, might be wiser.HOW come, in this age of state-of-the-art camera phones, when anyone spots the Loch Ness monster, beast of Bodmin Moor or any of the other fearsome creatures supposedly roaming our shores, the evidential photo is always out of focus?Exhibit A: The “lion” spotted in Oldbury in the West Midlands this week.Yep.

It’s the uncertainty caused by Remain diehards in the Commons and Lords bent on scuppering it and even destroying our Government.It is destabilising for firms not to know what Brexit will look like.

The Government must think again so that people don’t fall into debt or are left at risk of losing their home.”Lib Dem MP Stephen Lloyd added: “These lamentable figures show that thousands of people have still not responded to the significant changes on mortgage interest loans being pushed by the DWP.This is yet another cack-handed benefit change by the Tories which is wholly unnecessary, and is already causing anxiety amongst some of our most disadvantaged, marginalised citizens.The DWP said that any SMI claimants who havent got a phone call about the change will still get the benefit for at least six more weeks.Those affected are urged to contact the official hotline on 0800 731 0459 for pensioners or 0800 169 0310 for anyone of working age.A spokesman said: Over time, someone’s house is likely to increase in value, so it’s reasonable that anyone who has received financial help towards their mortgage should be asked to pay that back.“Everyone who signs up to the loan will continue to get help with their mortgage interest, and it’s only repayable if there is available equity when the property is sold.“If people decide to decline the loan now but change their mind in future the loan can be backdated so in effect there would be no break in payments.“We have already contacted everyone currently in receipt of SMI to explain the change but we are making sure people have time to review the documents, obtain advice and consider their options."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000283428196.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"burn wood they said itll be green they said how the eco freaks got us all wheezing","story":"Pollution in our cities is worse than it’s been for many years. The way things are going you could give your kids 20 Rothmans a day and they wouldn’t be much worse off than they already are.And the reason for this is a genuine scandal. A real eye-opener. It shows what happens when people in authority take notice of the people who know absolutely nothing. The Green lobby. The eco-freaks. The obsessive loons. The climate change fanatics.If you’re middle class, you’ve probably got one. They’ve become incredibly popular in the last decade.Trouble is they spew out enormous amounts of something called PM2.5 particles. That’s soot to you and me.They’re the major cause of soot in our cities and the main reason everyone you know is gasping for breath.We’re about to be sued by the European Union because pollution from these stoves is way above acceptable limits.But why do we have them?Because at the behest of the green movement, the government encouraged us all to have them. Burning wood is much better, they said, than gas or coal or oil. Renewable! Doesn’t churn out as much CO2!No, it just churns out lethal amounts of soot. Billions of pounds were spent by our government on a scheme to convert us to renewable heating systems.The brainchild of the disgraced Lib Dem halfwit Chris Huhne. Millions more was spent converting one of our biggest power stations to woodchip. The wood is shipped over 3,500 miles from the US (there’s eco-friendly for you). And it’s all made everything a lot, lot, worse as a consequence.Then there are diesel cars. You may have one. The government is getting tough on those, too.It’s now been discovered that they are much more polluting than petrol cars. It’s another major cause of pollution in our towns and cities.So why do we have them? Because the idiotic Greens told us to. Back in 2001 the Labour government offered tax breaks on diesel cars. Everyone rushed to buy one.A member of that Labour government has now ’fessed up and said it was the wrong decision, no question.But they wanted their Green credentials.And just look what trouble it has caused — 37,800 more deaths every year in this country simply as a consequence of those wood burning stoves. It is close to unbelievable.I wonder what the Greens will come up with next as an idea to save the planet.Maybe we should burn magpies, or sour cream and chive Pringles, or our own trousers.The truth is they haven’t got the remotest idea. They urge these measures upon us without the slightest notion of what might happen as a consequence.And the problem is that important people take them seriously. Governments, for example.And we end up paying through the nose for their idiocies — and then, a little later, gasping for breath.The wood burning stove business should convince all members of Parliament. Never listen to a green.No matter how nice he or she might seem. Just ignore them. They’re bad for your health.WHAT a shame – Roman Abramovich can’t get back into the country because we haven’t cleared his visa. So he’s sitting on his yacht somewhere, getting snippy.

Wolfe and Bellow were quite right-wing, so the literary critics will quickly consign their books to the “dead white male” rubbish bin of history. And as a consequence, we will have lost an awful lot.Keep their work alive, whatever the critics tell you. Read The Bonfire of the Vanities, or Couples, or The Dean’s December and marvel at the insight and the beauty of the prose . . .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I have my ears pierced, I cry at the end of The Greatest Showman and I enjoy shopping for clothes.Everyone has the right to say how they want the world to see them. Everyone has the right to be happy with themselves.Goodness knows there’s enough things to be unhappy about. You shouldn’t be one of them.But the Labour Party has now decided that anyone who says they are a woman is eligible for political roles that are for women only. They do not ask for any more proof than that.As a Labour member and a woman on Wednesdays, that means I am eligible to stand for one of those roles.So, when the position of Women’s Officer came up for election, I decided to apply. The post involves encouraging women to join the party and speak for women and their experiences - and can only be held by women.Standing for the position was a chance for me to talk about self-identification with my local Party and bring my concerns to their attention.Of course, I was not expecting to win, but I was ready to do the job if I did.I was happy to let people make a democratic, informed choice.Women are worried that letting men say they are women without any checks is dangerous.There is a fear that some men will identify as women just so they can go into changing rooms or loos and spy on or attack women.Women also say that it will affect women’s rights to dignity and privacy, for example on women-only hospital wards or in shelters.Those are also real concerns, but a small minority of people don’t want them to be talked about.They call feminists like Germaine Greer - who has said transgender women are not women - out-of-touch or get angry when people yell out body parts or facts on TV.Those people are stopping a very important debate. I don’t feel that’s right.And self-identification is not just Labour’s position.Nearly every political party in the UK says that the Gender Recognition Act should be changed so that anyone can legally change their sex just by saying they are a man or a woman.The Labour Party made their decision so they could be ahead of the change to the law.Some trans people say that the current requirements set out by the GRA are humiliating and difficult to cope with on top of living their lives. That is a real concern and one that has to be listened to.However, I don’t agree with the idea that you should be able to legally change your sex just by saying you want to.It ignores the very real struggles that trans people face every day.It says that I have had the same life experience as people such as the L’Oreal and Playboy model Munroe Bergdorf, journalist and TV presenter Paris Lees and Lily Madigan - a transgender schoolgirl who was sent home from school for wearing a girls uniform.It says that their life-long fight to feel right in their bodies is the same as me identifying as a woman once a week.I can’t begin to imagine what their journeys have been like, but I know those journeys need to be recognised by more than just words.Following a recent meeting of Woman’s Place UK in Basingstoke, I talked with a reporter about my nomination for the Womens Officer role. The article that he wrote led to the Labour Party suspending me yesterday, with immediate effect.I am not allowed to attend meetings or stand for election and there will be an investigation.They seem to think that I am not enough of a woman.Some people online think the same. I have to ask the question, how much more of a woman would I need to be?I hope that what I did shows we need the debate on gender identity.We need to find the common ground so that trans people can live as they want to, while allowing women the dignity, privacy and safety that they deserve.We are all here thanks to women, so let’s talk to them.Really? I mean, really? I first came across David Lewis smug grinning face in a magazine earlier this week. Announcing he was a woman from morn to midnight on Wednesdays and boasting that he is changing nothing. Not his clothes. Not his routine. Not his womanly beard.Why? Because 15 minutes of fame. Because trans rights has gone too far. Because proposed law changes.He is not trans: has no idea what it is to be trans.The situation he is describing does not happen and has not happened anywhere, except when anti-trans campaigners break the law to make a point.Being trans is not fashion, trend or choice. Mocking transness in this dishonest way hurts people.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was widely praised for bringing Marlon Brandos Method style of acting to the screen.But many remember him for his 1952 testimony before the House Committee on un-American Activities.There, he outed suspected Hollywood communists at a time many were losing work due to an industry blacklist. The anger had not subsided when Kazan was given an honorary Oscar in 1999. Some boycotted the ceremony and when Kazan approached the podium, after being introduced by Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro. Performers including Ed Harris and Nick Nolte sat grimly and refused to applaud. In his brief speech, Kazan offered no apologies. Carrying two books and a notepad, disgraced Weinstein walked slowly from a black SUV past crowds of reporters and TV crews.He gave a wry smile as he ran the media gauntlet towards the front door of the station.Weinstein — still being investigated for alleged sex crimes in London and LA — was questioned for around two hours before leaving the precinct in handcuffs flanked by two officers.In his first public appearance since October, he was then brought to a Manhattan court for a preliminary hearing.The former Miramax boss agreed to hand over $1million bail to ensure his release ahead of his trial, due to begin on 30 May.Weinstein will also wear a security tag, hand over his passport and submit to travel restrictions as part of his bail conditions.His lawyer Benjamin Brafman said outside court that Weinstein intends to plead not guilty.Mr Brafman added: We intend to move very quickly to dismiss these charges.We believe that they are constitutionally flawed. We believe that they are not factually supported by the evidence.Weinstein has denied non-consensual sex allegations, after around 100 women came forward to allege sexual misconduct and harassment by him.The avalanche of claims spawned the #MeToo movements, which saw sexual allegations levied against a host of Hollywood stars including Kevin Spacey, Ben Affleck and Brit star Ed Westwick.Lucia Evans - then aspiring star Lucia Stoller - told last year how she had been approached by Weinstein at Cipriani Upstairs, a club in New York, in 2004.The university student, now 34, said she gave him her number and an assistant set up a daytime meeting at the Miramax office, in the city a short time later.She says he then pounced on her when they were alone in an office together – forcing her to perform a sex act on him.Evans said: “I said, over and over: ‘I don’t want to do this, stop, don’t’. It was like it was just another day for him. It was no emotion.”She revealed she struggled with the decision to make a formal police complaint about Weinstein in an interview with the New Yorker yesterday.She told Ronan Farrow, one of the first journalists to report on the Weinstein allegations: At a certain point, you have to think about the greater good of humanity, of womankind.Last night leading #MeToo figures reacted to news of Weinsteins imminent arrest.Rose McGowan, who accuses him of raping her in 1997, said: I, and so many of Harvey Weinsteins survivors, had given up hope that our rapist would be held accountable by law.Twenty years ago, I swore that I would right this wrong. Today we are one step closer to justice.Investigators are also examining whether Weinstein broke an antiquated law that forbids luring or inducing any women to travel across state lines for the purpose of committing a sex crime, according to the Wall Street Journal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000408834890.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"fat workers start later work home rush hour anxiety","story":"Bosses should offer them flexible starts if they struggle on public transport or let them work from home.Professor Stephen Bevan told the European Congress on Obesity that firms should make more accommodations for overweight workers.Mr Bevan, of the Institute for Employment Studies, called for new laws so fat staff could sue if they felt they missed out on a job or promotion on weight grounds.Christopher Snowdon, of the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, branded the plan ludicrous.

They were also given behavioural support for six months.The rest received standard NHS weight loss advice.A year after being put on the programme, those put on meal replacements had lost 24 lbs, while those just given standard weight loss advice lost just 7 lbs.The findings were backed by former government obesity tsar Susan Jebb.She said: “It’s acceptable, effective and safe.“It’s only with all this info that we can really consider suggesting that it could be offered as a routine treatment for obesity.” She said it works because it is simple to follow and dramatically slashes calorie intake.Diet expert Prof Jebb, from Oxford University, said: “It is a break from old habits and a chance to re-establish new ones.“Losing a lot of weight is very motivating. Dieting is hard and boring and a short sharp programme may be easier to stick to that a long slow.” The Cambridge Weight Plan was developed by Dr Alan Howard at Cambridge University in the 1970s and launched as a commercial product in the UK in 1984.Fans include former Eastenders and Loose Women star Martine McCutcheon, who lost a stone in five weeks.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And it looks like there might be turbulent times ahead off-screen too.Actress Eleanor Tomlinson, who plays feisty Demelza, believes she should be paid the same as Aidan Turner, the star turn as Captain Ross.Eleanor isn’t sure how much Aidan takes home.But it has been confirmed this week that he tucks a heck of a lot more cash into his tight britches than her.Bosses at the company which makes the hugely successful Poldark series — back on TV next month — say it’s because he has significantly more screen time than any other character.I think they are quite right, and not just because of those half-naked scything scenes. As Ross Poldark, Aidan is ably supported by a splendid cast. But he carries the show and his character’s name is in the title.On the other hand, it was ludicrous that the luminous Claire Foy, who portrayed the Queen in The Crown, was paid less than Matt Smith, who played Prince Philip.Claire was the true shining star of this production and had more lines to learn, more scenes and many more long hours in front of the cameras than anyone else.Bosses were shamed into giving her £200,000 in back payments.I hope she enjoyed every well-earned penny, but she should actually have been paid a lot more than Matt.You also wouldn’t expect any actress playing Miss Marple to be paid the same as her male co-stars.She obviously deserves a bigger share of the pie, and likewise you wouldn’t for a minute acceptBrenda Blethyn being given equal pay with her young whipper-snapper sidekicks in Vera. She merits a far bigger salary.Brenda is the reason we tune in, and as the lead, she has more pressure to shoulder. Just like Poldark, if Vera had been a flop, then Brenda and Aidan would have taken all of the flak and their careers would have suffered.If actors and actresses are doing exactly the same work they should be paid exactly the same amount of money.That should apply across the board to every job in the land.It’s unfair for a female professor to earn less than her male counterpart, or someone working on the factory floor or in a shop to take home less just because she’s a woman.That’s why I was taken aback when new Strictly head judge Shirley Ballas defended the BBC for paying her less than her predecessor Len Goodman.Shirley graciously said it was because she was “on trial”. But I’m delighted that for her upcoming second series, bosses have apparently had a rethink.Whether this is because they feel Shirley has “proved herself” or is due to the outcry over equal pay, it is, at least, a baby step in the right direction.I would love to see the same applied in teaching, medicine, finance — every other job where men and women are putting in the same hard graft.When it comes to acting, equal pay is more complex.Marlon Brando was paid £2.6million in 1978 to appear as Superman’s dad. He worked for 12 days, refused to learn his lines and was on screen for less than ten minutes.It was thought his presence would put bums on seats, but it must have been hard to justify to the rest of the cast.Then there was Elizabeth Taylor, who cashed a cheque for a million dollars to appear as Cleopatra in 1963. Co-star Richard Burton was paid buttons in comparison.Stars are worth as much money as their agents can grab and it depends on their box-office appeal. It’s the same when it comes to certain West End shows or pantos.Talented singers and dancers have to watch half-witted reality stars being parachuted into lead roles and paid fortunes to shift tickets.So while I understand why Eleanor is a bit miffed, I don’t think she had a leg to stand on.But at least it has got people talking about equal pay and highlighting injustices.And if she is the undisputed star in her next role and getting most of the screen time, then she absolutely should get a bigger pay packet.MEGHAN MARKLE went from elegant, alluring, ultra-modern bride to a frumpy wife in less than 72 hours.Her gown was perfect, but this outfit she wore to a party for Prince Charles after her big day looked like one of Princess Anne’s recycled horrors.I’m not sure if it was because Meghan is now a duchess she felt she had to conform to a safe and stuffy look, but it really didn’t work.There’s obviously a lot more to the newest royal than being a fashion plate. She’s bright as well as beautiful and has always had impeccable style.It’s easy to dismiss fashion as being trivial and shallow, but what you wear makes a statement, especially if you are globally renowned.Meghan’s outfit for her father-in-law’s birthday bash at Buckingham Palace screamed that she had been assimilated into the royal “Firm” and was going to be a good girl.We just expected more from the feisty 36-year-old. I hope it was just an unfortunate blip.WOODY ALLEN’S life reads like one of those particularly dark and warped indie movies.He married one adopted daughter and still stands accused of sexually abusing another.He has been disowned by his biological son, the campaigning journalist Ronan Farrow, who helped expose the Harvey Weinstein scandal, over the alleged abuse of Ronan’s sister, Dylan, when she was just seven.Allen, who is now 82, remains lauded by Hollywood luvvies and besotted film buffs who think of him as a cinematic genius, although those who believe Dylan would describe him as a “dirty old man”.He was in a relation- ship with actress Mia Farrow, but their unconventional family fractured after Mia discovered he had been having a sexual relationship with her adopted daughter Soon-Yi, who he went on to marry.JEFF GOLDBLUM is one of the coolest guys on the planet.He’s quirky, eccentric and paddles his own canoe.There aren’t enough endearing characters like him on the planet, and he’s one of the best things about Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, the newest movie in lucrative franchise. Jeff reprises his role as Dr Ian Malcolm, who first appeared in the original movie 25 years ago. Dr Malcolm doesn’t think human beings should mess around with nature and is consistently proven right.Jeff shares many of those views and behind that arm-waving, kooky exterior is a man of fierce intelligence and laser-sharp insight.If we were ever to be stupid enough to clone dinosaurs, he’s the man you would want in charge of sorting the whole mess out.Maybe Trump could get him to fix North Korea before Jeff starts on peace in the Middle East.Now the story has hit the headlines again with another of Mia’s brood of adopted children breaking their silence to support Allen.Moses Farrow, 40, wrote a blog this week about the man he calls Dad stating that Allen is completely innocent of any charges of abuse, which inevitably means he thinks his sister Dylan is a liar.No charges have ever been brought against Allen, but the family is broken and poor Dylan has been badly damaged by the alleged abuse claims that have haunted her for 25 years.There are no winners in this sad situation, apart from Allen himself.Actors still queue up for parts in his films and he continues to live his life as a privileged New Yorker.The breath of scandal has barely touched him, but his son is a tenacious investigative journalist and if there ever is a case to answer, it will one day be father against son, brother against sister and mother against father – and will inevitably be turned into a movie.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As we walk along, the cameras move and follow us. For someone who values his privacy, it\u0027s a wonderful spot.Moored off shore is his boat, the Eclipse: registered in Bermuda, with a crew of 70, a helipad, a mini submarine.It is staggeringly large.Beyond it is another yacht, a little smaller, but still huge.This was was Mr Abramovich\u0027s too, until he lost a bet and handed it over to a mate.We approach the Eclipse and politely call out to the staff on board.As an attempt to find and speak to a Russian billionaire about his visa issues, this was always likely to be futile.And so it was.Our first introductions were met with a clear \"no\".But on the radio from our boat to the bridge of the Eclipse we managed a brief convention.Could we find out, I ask somewhat foolishly, whether Mr Abramovich is aboard and able to speak to us.\"That\u0027s all well received, Sir. At this moment in time we are unable to comment on the location of any guests. That\u0027s unable to comment. Thank you.\" Obviously he wasn\u0027t going to speak to us, but a little bit of his empire up close is a useful hint of the life of an oligarch.So what\u0027s the British government\u0027s apparent issue? Russian man gets rich, enjoys life, invests in London plenty have.Why, as foreign secretary, Boris Johnson said this week, will the UK \"continue to tighten the squeeze on some of the oligarchs who surround Putin?\"Mr Gould-Davies was serving in the British Embassy in Moscow when KGB defector Alexander Litvinenko was murdered in London.He has watched Russian behaviour in Crimea, the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine and, most recently, the Salisbury attack.\"Russian and other wealth in the UK has long been an ethical concern, but we have a dramatic new concern in particular since the events in Salisbury,\" he said.\"Russia is presenting a more aggressive threat to the United Kingdom and other Western European countries than it has at any time since the Cold War period.\"Now the Russian state, the Putin regime, depends upon elite networks of power and influence and wealth.\"So the Russian State is on the one hand presenting a threat on the other hand it\u0027s been sustained and supported by elites who make use of the UK\u0027s financial services to keep their wealth safe.\"That cannot be right.\"On the same day that Mr Abramovich\u0027s visa issues emerged, the British government\u0027s foreign affairs select committee published \"Moscow\u0027s Gold: Russian Corruption in the UK\", a report which recommended that the government cracked down on Russian wealth in the UK.It is something that American banker and author Bill Browder has been calling for ever since he accused the Kremlin of murdering his lawyer. Sergei Magnitsky died in a Russian prison in 2009.He had represented Mr Browder, who had been accused of tax fraud by the Kremlin.He lobbied the US congress to introduce the Magnitsky Act, a law to punish Russian human rights abuses with sanctions.He has called for the same in Europe and the UK.\"The US has made a very complete list. They made a list of 200 oligarchs close to Vladimir Putin. I think you could operate off of that list and the US sanctioned seven of those individuals. I think the UK as a first step should sanction the same individuals that the US has sanctioned,\" Mr Browder said.Mr Abramovich is not among those sanctioned in the US and has not been accused of any wrongdoing.\"But Mr Browder says all oligarchs close to the Russian president should be targeted.\"Most oligarchs did the deal with Putin and effectively became his business partner.\"And so when you hear about an oligarch worth $13 or $14 billion, probably $7 [billion] of that is Vladimir Putin\u0027s. \"And so, if you want to go after Vladimir Putin, you go after the oligarchs,\" Mr Browder said.Mr Abramovich\u0027s proximity to Putin goes back years.Well before he acquired Chelsea, he was one of Russia\u0027s most influential businessmen.He was close to Mr Putin\u0027s predecessor Boris Yeltsin he helped Mr Putin rise and he benefited from it.Mr Browder welcomed the decision this week to pass into law the Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill, which includes the \"Magnitsky amendment\" allowing the British government to freeze the assets and ban the visas of human rights violators from Russia and elsewhere.\"That\u0027s an absolutely powerful tool that can be used and should be used aggressively against these Russian oligarchs,\" he says.Back on the French Rivera, we watch the comings and goings."},{"url":null,"title":"former top aide tory cabinet","story":"NewsFormer top aide to Tory Cabinet minister cleared of sexually assaulting woman at partyRichard Holden, a former aide to Sir Michael Fallon, has been accused of groping the woman under her skirt but was found not guilty of sexual assault\u0026nbspShareByRachael BurnettDan BloomPolitical reporter17:39, 25 MAY 2018Updated17:40, 25 MAY 2018NewsRichard Holden, 33, had been employed as one of Sir Michael Fallon\u0027s media advisers (Image: PA)\u0026nbspShareGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA former special adviser to ex-defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon has been acquitted of sexually assaulting a woman at a party.

But Mr Gove would just be in no.10 for a transitional period until Scottish Conservatives chief Ms Davidson takes over, according to \u0027the plan\u0027. Ms Davidson is often tipped as a future leader. A former Cabinet minister reportedly called her “the messiah” and the answer to Tory issues.  They told The Sun : “Michael wants to be the leader, but he also accepts he can’t fight a general election.  “He knows he’s toxic to too many voters after his education reforms and running the Leave campaign. “Ruth can and should fight the 2022 general election for us, as she’s got it all - but we need to fill the gap – and Michael can do that.”  Earlier this week, Ms Davidson appealed for more young people to join the party. Launching a new think tank, Onward, she said: Sometimes as Tories we just look a bit dour. A bit joyless, a bit authoritarian sometimes. We don\u0027t get to win if we start hectoring the people we need to vote for us. We don\u0027t get to say \u0027please stand on the right\u0027 like every Tube message out there. We\u0027ve got to learn to be a bit more joyful.

Shane O\u0027Brien, 30, is alleged to have killed Josh Hanson in an unprovoked knife attack in a bar in Hillingdon, west London, in 2015. O\u0027Brien fled in the wake of Mr Hanson\u0027s death and was thought to be in the Netherlands and United Arab Emirates before returning to Europe. He changed his appearance and then went on the run in private jets, boats and helicopters.  He has been placed on Interpol\u0027s worldwide most wanted list and there is also a \u0026pound50,000 reward for information leading to his arrest and prosecution. Police say he is dangerous and should not be approached. Mr Hanson\u0027s mother Tracey and his sister Brooke said: Our lives will never be the same without Josh and I would not wish our living nightmare on anyone, it is a pain that no words alone can describe.  Someone somewhere also knows where O\u0027Brien is and can change the pain and uncertainty that each day brings for us.  We ask you to try and imagine the emptiness that we have been left to live with, please, please, please do the right thing and make that call or encourage someone else to. The politan Police say O\u0027Brien was flown out of the UK on a privately chartered plane from Biggin Hill Airport. He was arrested in Prague for criminal damage and assault in February last year under the Italian alias Enzo Mellonceli and released on bail.  Police say he has been travelling extensively and there were reported sightings in Gibraltar, Nice in France and Prague following an appeal for information in October last year. Detective Chief Inspector Noel McHugh said: Based on what we know about O\u0027Brien\u0027s lifestyle and interests, we are looking to people in nightclubs and boxing gyms as well as expats and any women he may have become involved with to come forward. Please do not assume that someone else will call in, what you perceive to be a small piece of information could in fact be the missing piece of the jigsaw that gets justice for Josh. He added: Everyone wants to give Josh\u0027s mum Tracey and his sister Brooke the news they so desperately need to hear. As the months go by, the lack of justice only adds to their heartbreak. Josh was an amazing young man with his whole life ahead of him and Tracey and Brooke miss him desperately. They need to see O\u0027Brien brought to justice.

The expensive, premium burgers came last after judges branded them “a huge disappointment” and slammed the taste as “awful” and the texture as “hideous”.

Tragic Chadrack Mbala Mulo was just four when he died holding onto his mother\u0027s corpse in Hackney, East London, in October 2016. An inquest into his death heard that Chadrack, who was mute and autistic, had been absent from school for nearly three weeks when he was eventually discovered. When his mum, Esther Eketi-Mulo, died after suffering an epileptic fit, he was unable to fend for himself. Although staff had a contact number for his mum, they did not have any way of contacting other relatives.  Coroner Mary Hassell said that unless new rules were brought in, other children could die in a similar manner,  reported last year .   New rules introduced by the Department for Education say that schools and colleges must now have one emergency contact number per pupil, where reasonably possible.  Nadhim Zahawi, Minister for Children and Families, said:  “This was a truly tragic case. Schools and colleges play an important part in keeping children safe which is why have recently taken action to update guidance that all schools have on how to deal with concerns about a child.  This now includes a specific reference to ask that schools, where possible, hold more than one emergency contact number for each pupil.” It is thought Esther died on October 1 or 2, 2016, but she and her son were not found until October 20.  By that time Chadrack had been dead for around two days, as a result of dehydration and malnutrition. Neighbours at the Trelawney Estate in Hackney reportedly thought the stench coming from the family\u0027s flat was from the mum\u0027s cooking. Staff from his school, Morningside Primary, had visited the home twice and rang several times in early October but could not get in. Ms Hassell said: They ... could not gain access to the block of flats where Chadrack and his mother lived.

Teachers ruled Casey Healy\u0027s recent trim - which he got specially for his brother\u0027s communion - was against the Chelsea school\u0027s policy. The prestigious college requires boys\u0027 hair be neat, tidy and a uniform length all over - with Casey\u0027s undercut allegedly failing to adhere to the rule.  His mother, Charlotte Healy, said her son has been left upset and worried after being sent home from school because of his hair shortly after registration at around 9.10am on Tuesday, getwestlondon reports .  The mum-of-three said: “They said that it\u0027s against their school uniform policy.  “It wasn\u0027t a dramatic cut, it was just a little bit shaved and then longer on the top.

He has been [at the school] for three years, he has 100% attendance and his punctuality is 100%. “Casey hasn\u0027t gone back in today, so now he\u0027s missing more time off school, which he doesn\u0027t really need to be doing. He\u0027s got his GCSEs coming up. “I can\u0027t see how a haircut would affect his education. It wasn\u0027t dyed, it didn\u0027t have any lines or any patterns. I could understand if he had it spray painted or it was very extreme.”  The incident occurred at St Thomas More Language College on Tuesday. According to Miss Healy, 29, her son had his hair cut for his brother\u0027s communion on Sunday, which she explained to staff at St Thomas More school on Tuesday. She suggested the family would be “back in this predicament” in two weeks time because Casey has his confirmation, for which he needs to be neat and tidy for church. “I\u0027m considering moving him from the school, which obviously I don\u0027t want to.

Sandra Holmes took her World War II veteran father, 93-year-old John Lenton, out of a residential home to board a plane to visit Dignitas to end his life on October 25.  Today, she has broken her silence on the emotional decision and why she accompanied her father to the clinic in an exclusive interview with the Daily Post.  Assisted suicide, in which dying person takes an active role in ending their own life, is legal in Switzerland but is a crime in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. She and her son, Scott, are still awaiting a decision by the CPS on whether they will be charged with a crime or not after they travelled with him to Switzerland.  John\u0027s death was reported to North Wales Police who are duty bound to investigate their role. Sandra, a former nursery nurse from Llanrwst in Wales, has revealed the family\u0027s emotional ordeal but also their strong belief in the right to die. She said: “This is my dad’s story, not mine. And I am telling it now as we strongly believe in everyone’s individual choice to make their own decisions at the end of their life.” John Lenton John Lenton was a proud and private man who had lived a full and active life. He was was born and brought up in Newport, South Wales and from there, he joined the Army. John\u0027s life in the armed forces started off as a soldier in the South Wales Borderers before he volunteered to join the Parachute Regiment, rising to Colour Sergeant. He fought in Italy, Algeria, Tunisia, France, Greece, Palestine and Egypt. He was also part of the forerunner to the SAS. Married to Jeanne, they lived in London after John left the Army and their only child Sandra was born in 1952. An active person all his life, he climbed and walked the hills and mountains. John was head hunted by Quinton Hazel where he worked as a production control manager and moved to Nebo with his wife 39 years ago.  Sandra described him as a “massively intelligent man.” She said: Mathematics, quantum physics, the historic movement of peoples and languages – these were not only his life but what he read to relax. “He was independent in the extreme, renovating their old cottage in the hills himself – from the roof to the smallest screw was done entirely by Dad. “He was very physical, clever but also a very private man – his family was his life, we were very close.” Once the couple retired, they bought a touring caravan and would spend three months of the year in Scotland. They were married for 64 years until Jeanne died in 2011. As John aged, his physical health started to deteriorate and following a hernia operation in 2011, he required a permanent catheter which at that stage he dealt with himself. He was extremely deaf and wore two hearing aids. In early 2017, he became bowel incontinent and his hearing worsened. He battled on, but Parkinson’s disease also had him in its grip and he fell several times. This often left him in hospital and he could not move from his chair without help. The final straw came last year when he was diagnosed with eye disorder dry macular degeneration, which was causing him to go blind, taking away his only remaining pleasure - watching his beloved news, nature programmes and sport on television. Sandra, who is semi-retired, became am carer for her father. She would visit him countless times throughout the day and he moved to be closer to her.  She said: “The total indignity of having his daughter care for him, changing and cleaning him was, for him, so humiliating. “Followed by young people (carers) – excellent though they were – cleaning and changing him was just so awful for a man that held privacy and independence so dear.” She added: “All of my adult life I have known that my mum and dad believed strongly in the right to die when you had reached a stage where you had no quality of life left. We all believe the same. “So in the spring of 2017, Dad asked me if we would be willing to accompany him to Switzerland to Dignitas, I was not surprised at all. “We talked about it many times and I spoke to Scott and my partner Ted as well. “We all agreed that if that was his wish then we would do this for him. “At no time did he have any doubts.” The journey to Dignitas The process was a long and arduous one taking seven months to plan. John needed a passport for a start, but in the meantime, his health continued to decline and then Scott suffered a stroke at the age of 40. Looking after them both left Sandra exhausted. The family decided that the best thing to do was to move John into a home and he was offered an emergency place at Cartref Bryn yr Eglwys in Pentrefoelas. Sandra said: “We all knew that was the best thing to do because Dad would be cared for while I was helping Scott. I’ve nothing but praise for the staff there. “But we also knew it would only be a short term measure.  “Dad never said a word about our plans the whole time he was there, he was mentally ahead of us all. “But for me, the emotional stress of carrying on a normal daily life and not being able to confide in anyone about what we were going to do was sometimes overwhelming.” The pensioner would go on to spend a month-and-a-half being cared for at the Pentrefoelas home before his daughter and grandson were ready to put their plan into action. Scott said: “We told the home we were taking Grandad on holiday in the UK for five days, we needed to find a reason to take him out of there without arising suspicion. “The care home called a doctor to assess whether he was well enough, and after a long talk with him, the GP decided that not only was he fit to travel, but he was more than capable of making his own decisions.” But that was just the start of the obstacles they would face. Sandra said: “It’s all very nerve wracking, it isn’t the easy process that some people think. “You are on pins and even getting to the airport was a nightmare because the law here can stop you leaving the country and you can be arrested. “Because of this, we hired a car so that our car couldn’t be followed or tracked to the airport, this is the lengths that the law drives you to. “Even though everything was in place, you are living in fear that you will be stopped and that the person you love so much will be left stuck in a half life they don’t want. “There is no feeling of safety until that plane takes off.” As John’s needs were complex, travel was not easy as he was in a wheelchair and the family booked assisted travel to ease the time spent in the airport. The whole process was increasingly stressful with the family worried someone somewhere had alerted the police and they could get a tap on the shoulder at any moment. Sandra added: “In your heart you know that no one could possibly know and stop us but you don’t relax until the aeroplane doors are closed and it starts taxiing down the runway. “And not because of the consequences for Scott and I, if they arrested us, we’d cope with it, but because it would scupper the plan and Dad would go on suffering. “From an emotional point of view, however difficult it was, we knew we were doing it because it was what Dad wanted.” In Switzerland Keeping conversation to a minimum due to John’s poor hearing, it wasn’t until the trio got to their hotel in Switzerland before they could finally speak openly about Dignitas. But even then, doctors had to assess whether they believed John was in the right mind to go through with it. Sandra explained: “You have to be in Switzerland for two consecutive days before you can go to the clinic, and an independent doctor has to come out both days and make sure it’s what the patient wants, and that they know why they are there, and that they are happy to continue with the course of action. “If the doctor has any doubts or feels they are under any pressure, then they will call the whole thing off.” But those two days gave the family time to relax and chat, and Sandra and Scott were able to find out where John wanted his ashes scattered. Sandra recalled: “Dad was able to have perfectly intelligent conversations and the thing that I found strange was that I thought two days in a hotel room would be a long haul with Dad not being able to do much, when actually, it was quite nice because the pressure was off.  You’re in a country where you can say why you’re there and what you’re doing, so there was a feeling of complete relief and we had time to sit and chat. “We talked about Dad’s wishes for his funeral and what he wanted to happen afterwards. “We discussed a place where he and my mum loved and he asked that their ashes be scattered together. “If we hadn’t had those two days, we never would have pinned down all the details. “It sounds weird but it was actually quite a pleasant time, Dad looked 10 years younger and you could see the weight had gone from his shoulders because we’d made it there and it was going to be ok.” Scott added: “You could see a dramatic change in his whole demeanour, he was very relaxed and happy to be there. “His main and major concern was what would happen to us when we came back but that was something we were prepared to deal with later.” John\u0027s final day They took John on his final visit to the clinic on October 25. Scott said: “The day is very practical to start with because you have to arrange taxis and transport to get there. “They’re lovely people there, very understanding, it’s quiet and secluded and they sit you around a table to talk you through everything that’s going to happen, all the while they are reassuring, making sure the person understands and that there are no surprises.  “You still have to fill out lots of paperwork and Grandad had to sign so many forms when we got there, it’s a misconception that you just take people there and they pop off. “Grandad was just so glad it was happening, he just wanted it to be over.” Sandra and Scott described the apartment room as homely with a couch, coffee table, bed and a couple of chairs. Relatives are able to sit and talk for as long as they like, but John was keen to press on. “He was the most relaxed I’d seen him in years because it was finally happening and his suffering was coming to an end,” said Sandra. “He didn’t have to put up with carers young enough to be his granddaughter changing his nappy, as he called it. “You could see it was all just stopping.” The family recalled how they “waited quietly” as the pensioner was given an anti-sickness drink, followed by a lethal powdered drug dissolved in a glass of water. Within 15 minutes, John had drifted out of consciousness and into a coma before peacefully passing away. “It was just like watching him fall asleep,” remembered Sandra. “The staff leave the room and come back into the background when it’s over, it’s all handled very sensitively. “It’s peaceful, there’s no pain or agony and no dying frightened like some people do in hospital. “It’s just calm and dignified and so much what Dad wanted and what he had planned.” Sandra and Scott admitted it was strange dealing with the range of emotions afterwards. “It’s the strangest combination of feelings, you’re upset because your loved one’s just died, but there’s a relief for him that he is set free from what he was suffering from,” said Scott. “There’s a gladness that it’s over - all overridden by the fact that he’s gone. “You feel guilty because you feel glad, it’s very strange, you just feel resolute.” Coming home They didn’t shy away from telling close friends and family when they got home to North Wales. “For the first time, we could be honest and tell people what had happened and actually talk about what we all believed in. “It didn’t matter what happened to us because of it, because we’re tough enough to cope, the main thing was, Dad couldn’t be affected anymore and that was my overriding feeling, along with exhaustion.” But Sandra and Scott had to prepare themselves to face any consequences and after informing the care home of John’s death in Switzerland, North Wales Police were notified. Under UK law, it is a crime to encourage or assist a suicide, and the offence carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison.  With end of life choice limited under current UK law, it is believed up to 10 British citizens a month choose to die at the Swiss clinic, which was set up in 1998. According to the charity Dignity In Dying, prosecution is less likely when the person had reached a voluntary, clear, settled and informed decision to end their life and the person suspected of assisting them was wholly motivated by compassion. Scott said: “Although we’d done so much research around Dignitas, you can’t find out what’s going to happen to you afterwards, you can’t ask anyone or pop into a police station. “But no one has ever been prosecuted on their return to the UK before. “If Grandad hadn’t have been in a care home, and we’d have taken him there from his flat, no one would have been any the wiser, all you have to do is register the death certificate.” Sandra added: “The law here is so antiquated. I think Dad’s concern was that we’d step onto British soil and be arrested immediately, it was never going to happen, lots of people go to Dignitas. “It’s a very caring organisation and offers tremendous support, indeed it was the only support.” North Wales and the CPS Assisted suicide, in which the dying person takes an active role in ending their own life, is legal in Switzerland but is a crime in England, Wales and Northern Ireland under the 1961 Suicide Act. It carries a penalty of up to 14 years in jail. John Lenton’s death was reported to North Wales Police who were duty bound to investigate Sandra and Scott’s role. She is currently awaiting a decision by the Crown Prosecution Service on whether it is in the public interest to prosecute them. Sandra said: “The police have been wonderful. They didn’t have an option but to investigate it but they’ve been very understanding and handled it with great care.

These early experiences helped to shape her lifelong commitment to causes such as social justice and women\u0027s empowerment. While filming in Toronto, The Duchess actively volunteered at a Canadian soup kitchen from 2011-2013. She also established the program at her place of work to ensure that leftover meals from the set were donated to local homeless shelters.

The Duchess of Cambridge’s ability to sell out everything from a \u0026pound175 Reiss dresses to those trademark pairs of nude LK Bennett pumps has caused a frenzy in the UK fashion industry. But now she has a rival in the new Duchess of Sussex, as experts predict Meghan Markle’s selling power could outshine even Kate’s appeal. And it’s not just Meghan’s fashion which could give the UK economy a boost – the American former actress has the added bonus of pulling in sales from her homeland across the Atlantic. So could the Markle Sparkle could take over the Kate effect...? KATE  FASHION It’s estimated that Kate pumps \u0026pound150million in revenue to the UK fashion industry every year, and her ability to sell out clothes is renowned. When her Sarah Burton wedding dress went on display at Buckingham Palace in the summer of 2011, approximately \u0026pound8m was raised for the Royal Collection.  Meanwhile, a \u0026pound38 Topshop dress she wore while pregnant with Prince George sold out within an hour of her wearing it to film studios.  And it’s not just luxury fashion and high street brands Kate helps promote. A \u0026pound10 bracelet in aid of Suffolk’s Treehouse Hospice sold out after the Duchess of Cambridge was seen wearing one in 2012. BEAUTY Ever since it was reported that Trilogy Rosehip Oil is responsible for Kate’s glowing complexion, a bottle of the \u0026pound16.50 product started selling every 20 seconds.  But her bouncy, blow-dried brunette locks are the real source of her beauty branding power. When it was revealed that the Duchess is a fan of Richard Ward Cleanse and Condition Shampoo, the \u0026pound5.99 product sold out immediately in Waitrose.  Richard Ward is Kate’s hairdresser and \u0026pound325 appointments at his Knightsbridge salon have seen waiting lists extend to six months since she became royalty. LIFESTYLE Kate and Prince William’s beloved dog Lupo is a treasured addition to their family, and is regularly seen in official portraits. The Kennel Club attributed the raised profile and interest in English Cocker Spaniels to Lupo, following a 50% surge in searches for the breed on their website following their ownership of the dog.  Meanwhile, the royal couple love taking the kids to the French Alps and after they were pictured visiting luxury skiing resort Courchevel, bookings for the three nearest airports spiked with 57% more flights booked than over the same dates the previous year. KIDS Valuation firm Brand Finance estimates that Princess Charlotte adds \u0026pound101m to the UK economy each year, while her older brother Prince George adds \u0026pound76m. At just six months old, Charlotte proved she had the same selling power as her mother. The \u0026pound21 floral dress she wore a family portrait immediately sold out and its Spanish designer M\u0026ampH was inundated with orders from around the world.  Meanwhile, Prince George’s cuddly kangaroo backpack sold-out just hours after Prince William was spotted holding it during a trip to Sydney in 2014.  FASHION In the run up to the Royal Wedding, Meghan caused several independent Canadian websites to crash by wearing their brands, including Line The Label, which she wore for her official engagement photos. She caused a 400% increase in traffic to jewellery site Birks, and a 1000% increase in sales to sunglasses brand Finlay \u0026amp Co, just by wearing their products.  Since the Windsor ceremony on Saturday, there has been a 160% increase in searches for Stella McCartney wedding dresses – Meghan’s choice of designer for her evening gown. Richard Haigh, of Brand Finance, says the 36-year-old’s branding power will only continue to soar. “Following the wedding, we estimated that her brand power will be \u0026pound150m a year, which is the same as Kate’s,” says Richard. “Based on our estimate, she could pull in the same kind of brand potential as Kate for the fashion industry.”  Meghan’s appeal could surpass Kate’s at the beginning, as she boosts American as well as UK brands, Professor Jonathan Shalit, who runs InterTalent, says. “The Meghan journey has been a completely phenomenal, unique journey,” he says. “The power of Meghan is quite staggering. I think she could be the biggest fashion brand in the world.” But Jonathan says there may be a shift over time. “I think right now she is the new kid on the block, and Kate is a mother-of-three,” he explains. “But eventually when Meghan has been doing this for a few years, they will both even out.” BEAUTY Down-to-earth Meghan was praised for the natural make-up and “messy bun” she sported on her wedding day, with hundreds of websites rushing to advise others on how to copy her style.  Online beauty brand Memi announced a 65% rise in sales of nude lipsticks since Meghan wore a taupe hue during her engagement interview. She also loves \u0026pound7 Nivea’s Skin Firming Hydration Body Lotion to keep her skin moisturised. LIFESTYLE It’s no secret that the Duchess of Sussex loves keeping fit and healthy, reportedly converting Prince Harry to green juices and helping him quit smoking. She’s been pictured in a variety of yoga poses on her now defunct Instagram and loves running around Kensington Palace Green.  Since she was snapped in Kensington’s posh health shop Whole Foods, sales at organic independents and retailers have enjoyed a 9.7% sales jump to \u0026pound359m.  Meghan’s also partial to a glass of wine, noting that her favourite red is the full-bodied and firm Tignanello – which she even named her lifestyle blog ‘The Tig’ after. While the yoga and pilates business brings in \u0026pound812m into the UK economy a year, the new Duchess’s lifestyle choices could see an even greater spike in its popularity. Her wedding alone is predicted to have drawn in an additional \u0026pound500m to Britain’s economy through tourism, travel, hotels and memorabilia, according to Brand Nation. KIDS Friends of the royal couple revealed before their wedding on May 19 that the pair hope to have a baby within a year of getting married.  While there is no doubt that the youngsters would be of huge public interest, they may not attract quite the same frenzy as George and Charlotte, says Jonathan.

The plan could see obese office workers miss the rush hour commute, demand an extra large chair or even work from home. A UK government advisor will propose changes at the European Congress on Obesity in Vienna as new research shows Brits are among most fat-ist in Europe. Prof Stephen Bevan has advised the Department of Work and Pensions and is a member of Public Health England’s advisory board. He will tell 2,000 medics that obesity should be classed as a “protected characteristic” allowing staff to sue fat shaming bosses.  Prof Bevan, head of HR research at the Institute for Employment Studies, said: “We need to coordinate our efforts so that people who want to work can do so. “It can be working time, it can be having a bit of understanding that someone might need to turn up at 10am because they have trouble with transport or anxiety about transport. “Many employers get away with whatever they want.” Prof Bevan will present a systematic review of research in to obesity workplace discrimination.  It included a major study on “weight stigma” in the NHS .  Another study found one in five Brits said they would object to an obese person marrying in to their family.  A third study by the European Association for the Study of Obesity found more than half of UK doctors thought overweight patients lacked willpower.  One in three said they were too lazy to keep weight off.  Prof Bevan added: “Some people say that obesity is the last characteristic that its still socially acceptable to make fun of .  “We have a scheme in the UK called Access to Work which not many employers know about. “If you are an individual living with a health condition or an impairment you can get support, paid for by the Government to make accommodations. “It could be transport or it could be working from home.”  Another study surveyed 90,573 people in nine countries and found only 47% of Brits believe food addiction is a reasonable explanation. This was lowest other than the US and Germany.

Sidney and Reginald Cugullere left London with the Jules Rimet trophy following their audacious raid.  With every policeman in Britain on the lookout for the cup, the brothers hid it in a brick lean-to outside Reg’s father-in-law’s home. The shed, at 71 Cowper Street, Luton, has survived the last half century but is currently in a state of disrepair.  Its wooden door is etched with graffiti and it is currently being used to house a washing machine.  \u0027I\u0027m in the dark about villains\u0027: Owner of Pickles the dog has never heard of 1966 World Cup heist thief  Reg\u0027s son Gary said: “My dad and uncle panicked and hid the World Cup in my grandfather’s coal shed. My mum told me he didn’t know anything about it. They just sneaked the trophy in and left it there until they had figured out what to do with it.”   Seven days after the World Cup was stolen it was found in a hedge by Pickles the dog and owner David Corbett.  Months later the trophy was raised by Bobby Moore at Wembley after England defeated West Germany 4-2.  Gary says his dad Reg, who died in 2012, believed traces of coal would have been on the cup when it was held aloft. He said: If the police carried out a forensic examination they would have found coal dust. A Mirror investigation revealed how Sid nicked the trophy from a glass display cabinet at the Methodist Central Hall in Westminster.  His brother Reg then put the cup under the front seat of his car and drove North to Bedfordshire The Cugulleres then stashed the priceless trophy while they worked out how to return it to the FA.  Historic records show Reg\u0027s wife Betty was living at 71 Cowper Street when she married in 1945, and her mum Nora died there in 1962.  Council documents prove Betty\u0027s dad Norman \u0027Jack\u0027 White, who worked as a lorry driver, was still living at the same address in 1966. Both Sid and Reg confided in Gary that the coal shed was where they hid the trophy for several days. The dilapidated outbuilding is now used as a makeshift washing room.

Before the two-bedroom terraced house went under the hammer, potential buyers were warned they would get it exactly as shown in pictures. And photos showing the inside of the West Yorkshire property did not look the most appealing. Heaps of discarded possessions stacked up in rooms throughout the Hemsworth home.  It was expected to sell for between \u0026pound20,000 and \u0026pound25,000, the Huddersfield Daily Examiner reports.   But, incredibly, one buyer was convinced it was worth a lot more than that and shelled out \u0026pound55,000. Auction House, which dealt with the sale, described the property as having been “neglected in recent years” but said it offered “an exciting opportunity for anyone looking for a project.” Auction House said that a nearby three-bed terrace on the same street had sold for \u0026pound88,000 in November 2017.

Officers are hunting the driver of the grey Audi A3, which sped off after the horror smash in Edinburgh that left one person dead. The car, which had false number-plates and may have been used in other crimes in the city, was found abandoned in Fife a few hours later. The crash happened close to Maybury roundabout in Edinburgh at about 12.30am yesterday. Witnesses told how the Audi drove over chevron road markings to overtake a number of vehicles, including a bus. It headed on to the oncoming carriageway, causing a BMW to swerve and hit a Peugeot 206, which was travelling in the opposite direction. Emergency services, including 14 firefighters, scrambled to the scene. It is understood fire crews initially believed every driver and passenger had been accounted for – but a victim was later discovered in the wreckage of the Peugeot, which had burst into flames. The BMW’s occupants – a 25-year-old man, 22-year-old woman and five-year-old girl – were all taken to hospital, where they continued to be treated for their injuries last night. The Audi was recovered in Lochgelly Road, Cowdenbeath – near to the local ambulance depot – at about 3.50am. It had been stolen from the Liberton area of Edinburgh on April 17.

Six-month-old Vanellope Hope Wilkins has beaten eight-million-to-one odds to survive the ultra-rare condition. The battling tot has since made incredible progress, thanks to a specially designed jacket she was given to wear which acts as an external rib-cage and protects her heart. Her parents had been told there was next to no hope that she\u0027d live when the abnormality was picked up at a nine-week scan. Mum Naomi Findlay, 31, and dad Dean Wilkins, 43, were advised to terminate the pregnancy but she refused and never gave up hope.  Vanellope\u0027s breast bone had failed to develop normally, causing her heart and part of her stomach to grow on the outside. The condition - called ectopia cordis - is extremely rare and most babies affected have a less than 10 per cent chance of survival. There were only a handful of cases worldwide where a baby has survived the condition and none in Britain. A team of 50 staff were on hand to assist when Vanellope was born by c-section at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester weighing 4lb 7oz at 9.50am on November 22 last year.  Six months on, she is still making an incredible recovery and has now been moved nearer to her family\u0027s home in Bullwell, Notts. She was transported from Leicester Royal Infirmary to Nottingham\u0027s Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham on Thursday. Her day-to-day care will today move to the medical team at Nottingham University Hospitals who will prepare her for going home in the coming weeks. Naomi spoke of her excitement and said she is looking forward to finally getting her baby home.  She added: “I started this journey, what seems like a long time ago now, when I had a scan at nine weeks pregnant. “There have been times when I really didn’t think she would make it, but she has fought so hard. I have been so incredibly lucky to have been surrounded by an amazing medical team. “It has been very hard for me and my other children over the last six months. “I have felt torn between my children, guilty when I am at home with my boys and then guilty when I’m in hospital with Vanellope, so this will be a huge relief and we will start to feel like a real family.

The man and woman were spotted getting rid of bricks and stones by the side of a road. But passer-by - a builder - was having none of it, and filmed what happened on his mobile phone. The video footage of their exchange shows him telling them: Put it back in your car and take it home, you scruffy f***ers! He refused to leave until every last bit of debris was put back into the car. The builder, who asked not to be named, said: I just happened to be in the right place at the right time.  It\u0027s disgusting that people think they can go dumping their rubbish on other people\u0027s land - how would they like it in their back garden? There\u0027s absolutely no excuse for it and I wasn\u0027t going to let them get away with it. I had to put a stop to it. The clip shows him pulling up and confronting the pair dumping rubbish on a farmer\u0027s field near Wakefield, West Yorkshire. The builder can be heard asking what are you doing? before the couple seem to try and justify leaving the waste at the side of the road. But he refuses to let the matter, and shouts: Pick it all up and put it back in your car and take it home.  Go on hurry up. You don\u0027t throw it in someone else\u0027s field do you? How would you like it if I thew a load of s*** in your garden? He asks the couple why they don\u0027t take the waste to the tip and when they claim it\u0027s closed, he says: Go tomorrow then! On a number of occasions, the couple can be seen on video trying to apologise for their actions but the builder has no sympathy for them and forces them to carry on picking up their waste. After loading dozens of bricks back into their vehicle, he insists they also move some building rubble dumped at the side of the road. The pair claim the waste isn\u0027t theirs - until the man gets out of his work van and points out it must be as it\u0027s bone dry when it\u0027s pouring down with rain.  Take it to the tip like everyone else, or buy a skip, the builder says. He continues filming the pair as the woman puts on a pair of gloves and fills a black bin bag with rubble, which they load back into their dark blue people carrier. Before they drive away, the couple ask the builder to delete the recording of them fly tipping but he refuses, saying you\u0027ve just been flytipping, I\u0027m going to wait here until you\u0027ve gone. Speaking afterwards, the builder who works from a site nearby, said: It\u0027s just not acceptable. I know there was a bit of f-ing and blinding from me but that\u0027s not a crime. They were fly tipping which is illegal. People are always leaving stuff there - sofas, chairs, building stuff, you name it - but I don\u0027t know what right they think they have.  I don\u0027t understand why they don\u0027t just take it to a tip, it doesn\u0027t cost them anything. I have a works vehicle so I can\u0027t do that and have to pay \u0026pound200 to hire a skip, they\u0027re just being lazy. The builder said there is a refuse tip just ten minutes from the layby where he caught the fly tippers - and claims he followed the couple along a road just a mile or so from it after the incident. He has had a largely positive response form the video, which he says he took to encourage others to step in and stop others fly tipping. I want people to know they\u0027re within their rights to hold people to account. It\u0027s not OK for people to fly tip.

Saturday will be sunny for most, but with the risk of sharp showers for central and southern areas. The heaviest and most widespread showers are expected over south-west England, especially in the afternoon.  Sunday will be sunny for many northern and eastern parts, although there will be thundery showers again for central and southern portions of Britain. Met Office Chief Meteorologist Andy Page added: “There is a risk of potentially severe thunderstorms during the Bank Holiday weekend. Saturday: Rain in northern England will ease to leave many fine and very warm. Southern and southwestern areas will see further thundery showers, whilst coasts in northeast Scotland could remain misty. Outlook for Sunday to Tuesday: Very warm over the Bank Holiday weekend with plenty of sunshine, especially in the northwest. Scattered thunderstorms in the south, especially on Sunday. Mist returning to eastern coasts from Monday."},{"url":null,"title":"well pay price forever mum","story":"News\u0027We\u0027ll pay the price forever\u0027: Mum describes life-changing moment learner driver dragged son, 5, under car leaving him brain damagedBobby Hughes, now six, was taken to hospital in an air ambulance piloted by Prince William after he was struck by inexperienced Eleanor Cass\u0027 car and dragged along the pavement\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByTommy Lumby13:48, 25 MAY 2018NewsMum Carly said Bobby [pictured] has \u0027been to hell and back\u0027 since the crash\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe mum of a five-year-old boy who was left with brain damage after being hit by a learner driver says her family will be ‘paying the price’ for the rest of their lives. Bobby Hughes, now six, was playing outside his house when he was struck by a car driven by Eleanor Cass, of Hertford, who had only nine hours of driving practice and had mistaken the accelerator for the brake. The child has undergone multiple brain surgeries and still needs round-the-clock care as the crash has left him unable to move or talk as before. Cass, 26, was jailed on May 23, after pleading guilty to causing serious injury by dangerous driving on April 18. Bobby\u0027s mum Carly Easter, who was good friends with Eleanor Cass\u0027 sister, said: Bobby and her nephew used to play outside the house. It was a beautiful little cul-de-sac the kids could play and be free. Eleanor knew that but she took it upon herself to drive.  Carly said that Cass had been to pick up her nephew from school on the day of the accident and that witnesses said she didn\u0027t have much control of the car. The mother-of-three continued: Why would you practice on a cul-de-sac where you know kids are going to be? Just five minutes before the accident, Carly explained how she called football mad Bobby into the house to tell him that his dad had bought tickets to go and see Tottenham Hotspur. She said: He was so excited to tell all his friends. Bobby went back outside and then, moments later, he was struck by the car. Carly said: She dragged him along. He was wedged under the car. He was lying there lifeless in a puddle of blood dying.  One of Bobby\u0027s sisters, who is now 11-years-old, was with him when it happened and started screaming. He was rushed to hospital in Saffron Walden and was then taken by air ambulance - piloted by Prince William - to Addenbrooke\u0027s Hospital in Cambridge. He spent four months at the hospital and then a further four at the Children\u0027s Trust, which is a specialist rehabilitation centre for brain injuries. My poor son has been to hell and back, said Carly. He\u0027s got to have three more surgeries. Speaking of Bobby\u0027s prospects of recovery, she said: With a brain injury you just don\u0027t know. We\u0027ve got a long and hard road ahead of us but we just don\u0027t know. Asked about Cass\u0027 sentence, she said: Nothing\u0027s ever going to be enough but I\u0027m glad we\u0027ve got some sort of of justice. I\u0027m hoping that she\u0027s got time now to think about what she\u0027s done, that her dangerous driving has caused this injury. Coming out of court, I slept well for the first time.

Emilia Wickstead claims the gown created especially for Meghan and Harry\u0027s big day is exactly the same as a \u0026pound7,000 one in her collection.  The Givenchy gown , designed by Clare Waight Keller was kept under wraps for months and reportedly required several secret meetings.  Dashing across London in a baseball cap or beanie, Meghan and Clare ran a covert operation in the lead up to the big day. But now Emilia has made some extraordinary claims about the dress - that was rumoured to cost between \u0026pound200,000 and \u0026pound387,000.  She said: Her dress is identical to one of our dresses. Apparently a lot of commentators were saying \u0027It\u0027s an Emilia Wickstead dress.\u0027 But that wasn\u0027t the only thing she slated - as she laid into the fit of the dress and even Meghan\u0027s hair on the day. She told the Daily Mail: If you choose a simple design the fit should be perfect. Her wedding dress was quite loose. Moving onto her hair, she said: I was like \u0027Hold the wisps (of her hair) back. It\u0027s a Royal Wedding for God\u0027s sake.\u0027  Meghan, the now Duchess of Sussex, looked stunning on her wedding day last Saturday. She accompanied her dress with a 16ft-veil detailed with flowers from all 53 countries in the British commonwealth and the Queen Mary\u0027s tiara, which she borrowed from The Queen. Birmingham-born mum of three Clare was on hand on the steps to make final adjustments to Meghan\u0027s gown and veil before handing her into the care of the page boys who showed off the 15 ft veil to such effect. She said: I wanted just for her to feel and look amazing. It was just an important moment to get all of that right and I thought she just looked spectacular, she said.  Asked about the moment Meghan was able to look at herself fully dressed and ready in the mirror on Saturday morning, Clare said: She was just glowing. There\u0027s so much emotion on a day like that anyway. But I think particularly when it all comes together, I think it is tremendous. She was absolutely radiant. She said it was confirmed to her in early January that she was the chosen designer. It was an extraordinary moment when she told me.  Of course it\u0027s an incredible thing to be part of such a historic moment, she said.  People also said previously said the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s gown reminded them of the dress J-Lo wore in 2001 film The Wedding Planner, pointing to the similar elegant off-the-shoulder neckline.   And others claimed the new Duchess of Sussex copied the idea from another royal .   Channel Nine presenter Allison Langdon made the accusation during her royal wedding coverage.  She said: It was Princess Mary. My first thought when I saw it was, we\u0027ve actually seen that before so I don\u0027t think she\u0027ll be setting wedding trends because I think she\u0027s copied. I think she did copy our very own princess, Princess Mary. "},{"url":null,"title":"why me need help stop","story":"News\u0027Why me?

Sophie Lionnet, 21, was starved, beaten, whipped with a cable and left with a broken chestbone ribs before being drowned in a bath. Her killers Sabrina Kouider, 35, and partner Ouissem Medouni, 40, were yesterday found guilty of murder. Police found a note written by a starving Sophie in the tiny, dark room where she was forced to sleep. It read simply: Why me? I need help to stop them. The victim\u0027s dad Patrick Lionnet, 56, told The Times: I will never hear her say \u0027daddy, I\u0027m getting married\u0027 or \u0027daddy, I\u0027m going to have a baby\u0027.  Those people are not human, they are barbaric. They have no humanity in them at all. And her mum Catherine Devallonne, 49, said: They took away her dignity and finally her life painfully ebbed away, until Sophie struggled to take her last breath in that bath. Kouider and Medouni had a twisted obsession with Boyzone founder Mark Walton, Kouider\u0027s ex, and wrongly accused Miss Lionnet of conspiring with him. Her burnt body was eventually found on the couple\u0027s patio when firefighters were called to reports of foul-smelling smoke. In chilling audio recordings, captured on Kouider\u0027s phone, they could be heard firing questions at their terrified victim during the interrogation sessions, which took place over 12 days before her murder.  The violent questioning was conducted by the duo in a bid to force the nanny to confess to various false crimes. In the weeks leading up to her death in September last year, the couple beat, starved and tortured the shy 21-year-old by dunking her head into water. Having killed her in the bath, the pair threw her on a bonfire in the garden of their home near Wimbledon, south-west London, as they barbecued chicken nearby. The body was discovered when firefighters were alerted by neighbours to pungent-smelling smoke, but Medouni tried to pass off the charred remains as a sheep. And Kouider claimed to police that Miss Lionnet had run off with ex-byofriend Mr Walton in an attempt to frame him for her disappearance.  The defendants later admitted disposing of her body but denied Miss Lionnet\u0027s murder, blaming each other for her death. An Old Bailey jury found both of them guilty of the murder following a two-month trial that was described as stranger than fiction. Miss Lionnet\u0027s parents travelled from France to see the disturbing evidence as it unfolded. The court heard how fashion designer Kouider was fixated with her ex-boyfriend Mr Walton. After splitting up after two years, Kouider reported him to police more than 30 times and received a caution for branding him a paedophile on a fake Facebook profile.  She also accused him of sexually abusing a cat, using black magic and hiring a helicopter to spy on her. Giving evidence, LA-based Mr Walton said he had been in love with Kouider but she would flip and go crazy for no reason. Another ex-boyfriend Anthony Francois described her as a lunatic, fickle and unstable. Jurors heard more than eight hours of recordings in which Miss Lionnet was slapped, likened to a Nazi collaborator and called worse than a murderer by her tormentors. Kouider, who claimed to know influential people including US President Donald Trump, threatened to have her locked up and even marched her to a police station.  The victim\u0027s distraught mother had begged Kouider to send her daughter home but she refused. In her final days, Miss Lionnet was hit with an electrical cable and beaten so badly she had five broken ribs and a cracked breast bone. In a filmed forced confession, the emaciated and broken young woman claimed she had drugged Medouni so Mr Walton could sexually assault him. Within hours, she was dead. Before the trial, Medouni claimed Miss Lionnet died by accident after he punched her during an interrogation in the bath. He offered to admit manslaughter but later retracted his confession, saying he made it to protect his wife, who has been diagnosed with a borderline personality disorder.

The neglected building has been abandoned for years, but new pictures have emerged which show how it may be a going concern again. Stunning snaps show a column of lights scaling the full height of the notorious Ryugyong Hotel, culminating in an enormous LED display of the North Korean flag. The development comes as Kim Jong-un\u0027s secretive state attempts to build a world level beach resort in the coastal city of Wonsan in a bid to attract more tourists. Construction of the sinister-looking hotel began way back in 1987, and was supposed to open in 1989.  Had it finished on time, it would have been the tallest hotel in the world. Construction then stopped in 1992 as North Korea entered a period of economic crisis following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Photographer Philippe Daniel snapped the lights at the 105-storey skyscraper during a visit last month and was told they had been added only two weeks earlier. He said: There are two vertical lines of lights at the front of the hotel, those lights are moving upwards from the bottom to the top, colours shifting between blue and red. The tip of the hotel has a 360-degree LED panel showing an animated North Korean flag waving.   These aren\u0027t the highest resolution panels they could have used - you can still clearly see the pixels - but they\u0027re still impressive, especially when seen from the front with the vertical lights.  In the day, it doesn\u0027t look like there are any LED panels up there...  It must be individual LEDs embedded in the facade. French-born Mr Daniel, who now lives in Singapore, said his North Korean chaperons weren\u0027t keen to discuss the building, but there was no escaping it. It seemed like the guides didn\u0027t wanted to talk much about it, the 29-year-old said. But you can see it from everywhere. It\u0027s kind of the first thing you can see of Pyongyang, even from afar. I think it became more like a piece of the propaganda rather than a functional hotel.

Championship down south, now seem the 23-year-old’s most likely destination.The Tangerines announced last night that Fraser had rejected their offer of a lucrative new deal and would be pursuing other options.He’s been speaking to a number of clubs in England and there has even been interest from abroad.For the past month or so Hearts have appeared to be leading the race for Fraser and their first-team coach, ex-Tannadice favourite Jon Daly, has watched him on several occasions.Burton, managed by Nigel Clough, have now jumped to the front of the queue.They’re expected to beat off that interest from Tynecastle as well as offers from English rivals Peterborough and Blackpool, to get Fraser fixed up.Accepting the player’s decision to go, manager Csaba Laszlo stressed United had fought hard to hang on to him.“We did everything we could to keep Scott at the club,” he said.“He is a gifted player and we made him a very good offer to stay with us.“He is a great example to young players of the pathway that is open to them in professional football and I have no doubt he will do very well in the future.“We know that good players will attract attention and, for this reason, we are already at an advanced stage in replacing Scott and a number of the other players that left at the end of the season.”Fraser himself made it clear after over a decade at Tannadice he felt the time to move to pastures new had come.His big regret is the broken foot that’s plagued him since early last year prevented him doing more to help in the battle to get back to the Premiership.He first broke it at St Mirren in March 2017 and did it again at the same venue when United lost there at the end of December.“I would like to take this opportunity to thank the club for everything they have done for me over the past 12 years.“When I joined the academy back in 2006 I could only dream of making over 100 appearances.“Unfortunately, my last season was the most frustrating I have ever had with the injury and I am gutted we couldn’t achieve promotion.“Thanks to all my team-mates, coaches and managers over the years.“I now feel the time is right for me to move on in order to improve as a player by playing at the highest level I possibly can.“Thanks again and good luck for next season.”Meanwhile, Graeme Liveston, who for many years was in charge of United’s youth recruitment in the west

Kayleigh thought I was just drunk and told me to stop drinking. I had only had three drinks!“The ring finally arrived around 5pm and I made a speech in front of both of our families and got down on one knee.“Kayleigh had no idea I was going to do it.”Kayleigh added: “I was so shocked.

has welcomed a host of new restaurants in recent years – and one of its most famous streets could be set for a food boom.Much like the Waterfront, Reform Street – previously considered the city’s answer to Savile Row – is in the midst of a transformation.The street has been maligned for many years, with many empty units blighting the once bustling thoroughfare.But several planning applications have been put forward for new eateries to join the others that have arrived in the street in recent years.Project Pizza (previously Project Pie), German Doner Kebab and Asian-themed restaurant Dai Pai have proved popular destinations.John Brandon, manager at Project Pizza, said he was encouraged by the latest applications and believes the restaurant trade could hold the key to reviving the street’s fortunes.He said: “When we first opened it was great, we had a great flow of customers.“There has been something of a steady decline in the last year or so but it’s good to see there have been quite a few applications put forward.“I don’t know if it’s the case that people’s tastes are changing and we’re in competition with other parts of the city which are seeing more footfall.“I think the restaurant sector is where we’re going to see a big difference in Reform Street.“You’ve got the shopping centres nearby, so I think if it’s turned into almost like a food court set-up with lots of different options then that could really give us a boost.”Permission has been granted by city planning chiefs to convert the former Swinton Insurance shop at 37 Reform Street into a coffee shop and takeaway.The Little Things Cafe will offer hot drinks and baked treats such as cupcakes and macaroons, along with paninis, soup and sandwiches.Lisa Shek, who submitted the application, said the menu could later expand into “Asian baked products”.In August, the Tele reported that listed building consent had been granted for an application to open an independent Scottish-themed diner.Plans were put forward to create 20-25 jobs at the eatery at the former Jessops camera shop.The restaurant would deliver “traditional and contemporary Scottish cuisine”, according to documents submitted to council chiefs.Mr Brandon envisages even more interest in restaurants as the overhaul of Dundee’s Waterfront progresses.He added: “As far as I’m concerned, the more restaurants the better.“It helps everyone if there are different businesses and options, so that could help it become the place to be for food.“I think we’re going to see a difference in the future once things start to come together with the V\u0026ampA and the Waterfront.“I do think they should be investing in Reform Street to try to clean it up and make it a lot more attractive.“We’ve got a lot of empty units at the moment but it’s good that people are at least prepared to try to open up new places down here.”Community figures and councillors have regularly called for out-of-the-box thinking to fulfil Reform Street’s potential.Alison Henderson, chief executive of Dundee and Angus Chamber of Commerce, believes there is a growing trend for people to look for things to do in the city centre.She said: “Whether it’s going to The McManus or coming out of the office at lunchtime for a coffee, independent businesses are great for the city, and its centre, so it’s absolutely to be welcomed.“Hopefully people will support the street and it will get the footfall that it needs.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b05375707da0-e1527072047490-709x564.jpg ","title":"fraser fyvie tipped to be main dundee united man by ex star","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIt’s going to be a summer of signings for Dundee United as they attempt to build a squad capable of getting out of the Championship.As many as 17 new faces from goalkeepers to strikers are expected to come through the doors at Tannadice as manager Csaba Laszlo, aided by club legend Paul Sturrock, completely revamp the home dressing-room.That’s likely to see a mix of youth and experience as well as some exciting talent arriving right up until the end of the transfer window in August.One United old boy, though, believes Laszlo and Luggy might already have made their most important signing.The former player is Stuart Duff and the capture he believes could be more significant than any other is that of existing employee Fraser Fyvie.The midfielder’s campaign in the season just ended was ruined by a knee problem suffered at Christmas. Prior to that the Tangerines were unbeaten in 15 of 16 league games he played.With the 25-year-old set to return around the start of the new season, Duff believes it was vital United beat off interest from Championship rivals Ross County to get him fixed up on a new two-year contract. Having known him since he was a kid at Aberdeen the best part of a decade ago, Duff is well placed to judge what he can do.“I actually watched one of United’s play-off games with Fraser and from speaking to him I know he is working hard to get back fit,” he said.“He’s about to start running again so it shouldn’t be too long before he is back. That, and him signing a new deal, is very good news for United.“You saw the quality he has when he played for part of last season.“He was a bit of a stand-out in the United team and I will not be surprised if that’s the case again next season.“It really will not surprise me if they build the team around him because that’s the level of ability he has.”With most of last season’s team gone, Fyvie will be surrounded by new faces.That will make United something of an unknown quantity and bringing so many players in at one time has to be something of a gamble.For Duff it’s a calculated risk and, so long as the right type of player is sourced, he believes the team can gel.“I think if you go out and get the right players with the right attitude and philosophy, it can work.“You want players who want to come in and work hard to prove, basically, why the club signed them and that they should be playing at a club like United. If they do that then United can be where they want to be.”And having spent the best part of a decade at Tannadice from the start of his career, he would like nothing better than to see them back in the top flight.Last week he was back in a United strip for Dave Bowman’s annual game to raise cash for skin cancer and dementia charities. Running out at Tannadice reminded Duff where United should be.“You look around the place and it’s geared up for the Premiership but no one has the divine right to be there, you have to earn it. It will be a battle again next season because it’s a tough league.“But I was here nine-and-a-half years from when I was a kid and the upbringing here was very good – second to none – so I want United back up.”At 36, and despite recently taking on a new job with the Connect Energy Group that involves a lot of travelling, Duff has no plans to hang up his own boots.Next season he’ll again be plying his trade in the Highland League with Inverurie Locos.“The new job is keeping me busy but I do get Saturdays off so I’m available and happy to keep playing.“We finished third last year, so the aim is to go a bit higher next season.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/Sbro_Viridor_Fire_Perth-8.jpg.jpg ","title":"lithium ion batteries may have

costs could soar to over 20m","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe price of Dundee’s planned new stadium development could soar to well over £20 million due to access requirements.But while original estimates of the cost to build “Nou Campy” are understood to have been between £15m and £18m, the Dark Blues will plough ahead with the project they hope to complete by 2020.A site between Camperdown Park and the city’s Ice Arena has been earmarked for the state-of-the-art facility that would include training pitches, a retail park and housing development.The fact it’s also adjacent to the Kingsway, however, means close scrutiny is being paid to how it would be accessed.Transport Scotland, the body responsible for the country’s trunk roads, require certain conditions to be met before they’ll give their blessing.Best case scenario would be for a new slip road to be included, meaning costs could be kept to a minimum.The stumbling block with that would be traffic only being able to enter and exit on the northbound carriageway of the A90.If that meant a new junction had to be constructed to allow access for south-bound vehicles, the increase in cost would run well into seven figures.Talks between the club and Transport Scotland have already taken place but the authority will only give their verdict once they’ve received detailed proposals.“Road safety is of paramount importance for everyone that will use the stadium, the associated commercial developments and the wider road network,” said a spokesman.“We’re working with the developer to get absolute clarity on their proposals and the potential impact on issues like vehicle access to and from the site.

That still amazes Dixon.“Honestly, knowing Kev’s talent when he went down to Burnley and got promoted to the Premier League, I expected him to do what Virgil van Dijk and Andy Robertson have,” he said.“I was sure it would be a stepping stone to one of the top-six clubs down there because that is the kind of ability he has.“He was thrown in at the deep end at Dundee, like a few of us were, but he quickly became a very big player in the team and it wasn’t a surprise when English clubs started watching him every week.“Burnley seemed a good move for him because he was getting a game and they got promoted but something went wrong and it knocked him back for a while.“What exactly the story was I don’t know and maybe we never will, but for me the good thing is he is back in with a chance of getting up to the highest level again.“I have to say when you look at the clubs he’s played for down south and the number of games he’s had, you would never say he’s had a bad career.“It’s just that he belongs in their Premier League and I really do hope Fulham win tomorrow and he can spend the next few seasons at that level.”He notes with interest McDonald is no longer the attacking midfielder of his Dens days, but tends to be the man who sits a touch deeper.For him, that’s just a another sign of his all-round ability.“Kev was very much an attacking midfielder when we played together but the times I have seen Fulham on television this season he has had more of a holding role.“He can still get forward and chip in with a few goals and he’ll be a very important player for them at Wembley.”Such is the “small world” nature of football that McDonald is not the only reason Dixon will be rooting for the Cottagers in a game that could earn the winners £160 million, even if they were to be relegated this time next year.“Oliver Norwood plays beside Kev in their midfield and I played in the same team as him at Huddersfield, so it would be good to see them both go up.“I even know the other midfielder, Stefan Johansen because I played against him a few times when he was at Celtic and I was at United.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/08/598c50e5ced49-e1505748380849-940x557.jpg ","title":"poll do you back a name change for dundees dens park home","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDens Park could be set for a historic name change ahead of next season’s kick-off.The Tele revealed earlier this week that Dundee FC, which has played at Dens since 1899, may be set to incorporate the name Kilmac into the stadium title.Sources have said the name change would be similar to that introduced by former Premier League counterparts Partick Thistle FC, who now play at The Energy Check Stadium at Firhill.We want to know whether you think a naming rights deal is a good idea to give the Dark Blues more income.Simply answer yes or no below.Dens Park no more?
