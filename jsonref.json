It\u0027s a constant moral conundrum for my team and I. \u0027Does playing a radio edit validate the original lyrics in the first place? Do we not play the song at all?\u0027  I am a woman. I f****** LOVE rap music. I don\u0027t want to hear any more lyrics about women on their knees.\u0027          Annie Mac made an impassioned plea about the level of misogyny in the rap and grime sceneAnokye, who was signed to Island Records, was described as a \u0027violent, controlling narcissist and a bully\u0027 by prosecutors during the case.Jurors heard how he derived sexual pleasure from torturing the women by water-boarding, interrogating, assaulting and raping them.The musician spoke of dacryphilia – sexual arousal from tears – and enjoyed playing a game he called \u0027Catch me, Rape me\u0027.He forced one woman to lie in a bath of freezing cold water, held a shotgun to the head of another woman and made one sit with a bottle of water tied to her finger with a shoelace.Police launched an investigation in 2017 after a woman claimed she had been raped at Anokye\u0027s waterfront apartment in Bristol. "},{"url":null,"title":"Do coronavirus cold CDC releases graphic help people tell difference","story":"Share this article          Those displaying symptoms such as fever and a cough are advised to self-isolate         The CDC advises to clean your hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds.CAN IT BE SPREAD WITHOUT SYMPTOMS?Initially scientists feared carriers who had no symptoms could pass it on.

I decided the stone works that I’ve made over the past 25 years, and I’ve never shown in the UK before, would sit quite well there. Then it felt right to put in some mirror works, and put the Sky Mirror in the grounds. It came together as quite a precise project.What are you investigating with the stone sculptures?Most stone carving, over the last centuries, has been to have a block of stone, and then carve, like Michelangelo did, from outside in. What I’ve been doing, perversely, is to carve the interior. The block stays as it was quarried, and then I’ve been working on the inner form.Do you have a sense of yourself when you mount a retrospective exhibition?Yes, inevitably. I don’t like retrospectives, really. I’m looking to bring to life bodies of work that I hope make sense together. I seem to have a disjointed practice, because on the one hand I’m making these very geometric, very pure objects and on the other my work is messy and all over the place – whether it’s a great pile of wax or these ritualistic paintings that I am making for an exhibition at the Modern Art Oxford gallery in September. Yet they are one practice – and they are, in a way, very similar to each other.The black objects you are making with Vantablack, the world’s darkest black substance, will be shown for the first time in the Accademia in Venice next year. They are thrilling…I’m very excited by them. The material is, in a way, mythological. Imagine being able to describe a material as the blackest in the universe – including black holes. That’s kind of daft, isn’t it?How do you think it is now for young artists?Incredibly difficult. I think the art world is in severe difficulty. At one level, it’s booming. But what does that mean for artists? We are not makers of luxury goods.I am part of that system too, so I’m not speaking as an outsider. But if everything’s for sale, how is it possible to find anything that’s radical? It’s so hard to maintain one’s distance from the commodification of the object.And for young artists today, it’s impossibly hard to find space in London, it’s so goddamn expensive. When I first had a studio in east London in the early 80s it cost £5 a week...What advice would you give to someone starting out?It’s taking your metier as an artist thoroughly, absolutely, totally seriously. It’s not a part-time activity… it is what we do all the time. Perseverance and endurance, or something like it, that’s what you need. Do you still work every day?Oh yes, I have a practice. I think Mae West once said: “I’m so tired of being admired.” I’m so tired of being inspired. Inspiration is marvellous, but it’s not really about that. I work a very normal day, 8.30am to 7pm, five days a week – I don’t work on a weekend. And it’s through the practice of working that things occur. It doesn’t matter what you do. Just do it.You were vocally opposed to Brexit. What’s your feeling now?It continues to be a disaster. Psychically it’s about where we are and how we see ourselves. This idea that Britain can do special deals and play a big nation… I think it’s a fantasy. An isolationist, sad fantasy. Yet political discourse has almost ceased on the subject. I hope it will return.Would it make you think about leaving?I’ve had serious thoughts about leaving. And sad thoughts, because I’ve been here 40 years.Why do you feel the need to speak out?We’re all citizens, and as citizens we have a voice. I feel it’s important to engage, but I do believe that’s different from agitprop. My art has its political position but it isn’t speaking in a political voice. But as a citizen I do! And so, stupid or otherwise, I’ll continue.You’ve recently managed to stop the National Rifle Association of America using an image of your Chicago sculpture Cloud Gate in one of their films…Yes, I did. They put out a vile little film using public objects as images of the so-called liberal invasion of traditional American space. I thought the whole way it was done was revolting, so I decided to fight on the basis of copyright. A group of American lawyers took it on pro bono, and I agreed to pay their expenses. They say it was the first action to cause the NRA to retreat from a position, and they’ve been retreating ever since. Yay!I could have had a war with him, but I didn’t want to. But it always was a bad idea, according to me. Either you do something as a public object, or it’s a commercial enterprise. To mix the two up is confusion. It doesn’t work.Generally, you always seem enthusiastic and curious. Is that true?I’m an idiot, you know. Just deeply engaged in what I’m doing. I’m not interested in doing what I know how to do. I’ve just had my 66th birthday and I hope I can work with the same kind of idiotic enthusiasm that I had when I was 20.• Anish Kapoor at Houghton Hall runs from 29 March to 27 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d574d00626dcfc0b1e41880e6c16af8899b860b7/0_63_2736_1642/master/2736.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a02dcb9e6d5b2856e932f6ed1c96995e","title":"20 photographs of the week","story":"The spread of Covid-19, International Women’s Day and a punch on the nose – the best photography from around the world in news, culture and sport"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8be2ff793fec5ee2f1147067b5324161af88ebfe/0_286_1181_709/master/1181.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48eefcdb9ba32bcbde625cce4e4e2011","title":"ice ice baby fishing huts of lake winnipeg in pictures","story":"“The bright colours and unique designs really caught my eye,” says Sandra Herber of the ice-fishing huts on Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba, Canada, which she began shooting in 2018 for a series now nominated for a Sony world photography award.

She is best known for Parallel Lives, her acclaimed study of Victorian marriage as seen through the relationships of five literary couples including Effie Gray and John Ruskin, and Catherine Hogarth and Charles Dickens. The book is being reissued in a new edition with an introduction by Sheila Heti.Parallel Lives first came out in 1983. What’s your relationship with it now?I’m astonished by it. I’m very proud of the girl who wrote it. It’s miraculous that this girl knew so much, and was able to write so wittily.Does that girl strike you as having been unnervingly wise?“Unnerving” is a good word for it. I can’t tell you where that wisdom came from, except that the magic of biographical writing is that you get out of yourself: you’re up in the clouds, looking down on people. You get a distance that isn’t available to you in terms of looking at your own life.I think George Eliot and George Henry Lewes are the beating heart of the book…In the prologue to Parallel Lives, you say that gossip is the beginning of moral inquiry. Do you stand by that?Yes, I think that’s true. It’s the reason that women in general have finer sensibilities than men. They’re used to talking about other people’s behaviour. Men don’t do that, and they’re a little morally dull.Is biography just high-class gossip?I feel that it’s an art form, but also that it’s never definitive. When I was writing about Virginia Woolf in 1979, her nephew Quentin Bell was about to publish his own book about her. I was anxious. It seemed to me that what I had to say about her – which had to do with the fact that being a woman was central to the way she saw life – was so obvious that he would say the same thing. But though he wrote a great book, he didn’t see that, and I was so happy and relieved.You also say in your prologue that human beings invoke love at moments when they want to disguise transactions, like marriage, that involve power. Do you still see marriage like that?Women may be less inclined now to be hoodwinked by romantic folderol. But power still resides in marriage, and the stuff about weddings is still incredibly potent, which is why it gets Instagrammed.

Our revised forecasts now include recessions in the eurozone and Japan. The US will teeter on the brink of one too.”Germany spearheaded Europe’s response to the economic damage caused by the coronavirus crisis when it announced “unlimited” aid to see businesses through the difficult times ahead.The government unleashed an initial €550bn (£500bn) in government-backed loans, which the economy minister, Peter Altmaier, said was “just for starters”.Meanwhile, the head of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has described the coronavirus as “a major shock” to Europe’s economies, as she promised a multi-billion euro fund to handle the fallout. In Europe, stock markets staged a minor recovery, but failed to recover their losses of the past week.Oil prices also recovered before falling steeply, with Brent crude futures rising before slumping back to $34 a barrel. Analysts polled by Reuters have drastically cut their average forecasts for oil prices over the course of the year, from above $60 a barrel to only $42, amid a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.More central banks on Friday moved to try to prop up their economies. The People’s Bank of China said it would lower the amount of cash that banks lending to businesses needed to hold in an effort to stimulate more loans. The Bank of Japan also promised to boost liquidity in markets used for bank financing.Adam Slater, lead economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics, said central banks faced a “formidable challenge” as the pandemic added to company vulnerabilities that were already evident, such as high debt levels and cash shortages.“The coronavirus is set to sharply cut global growth and also risks sparking substantial levels of financial distress among both businesses and households, potentially cascading into the banking sector,” Slater said.On Thursday, the Fed promised $1.5tn (£1.2tn) in liquidity support for bond markets, after the outbreak caused disturbances in the crucial market for US government bonds. The European Central Bank (ECB) also took steps to boost lending by eurozone banks, but markets still took fright as it held interest rates steady.Economists expect the ECB to take further steps in the coming weeks.“We think the ECB is even more likely than before to have to revisit its toolbox in order to re-establish confidence in its determination to deal with the crisis in an effective manner.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cdd2bd817e71bb0323c363478397111a48b868e/0_39_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=288a5d354ac69ce342e432934736104a","title":"amazon open store without checkouts uk","story":"Amazon hopes to transform another sector of the British retail market by bringing a checkout-free food store to London.Later this year, the US retailer is expected to open an Amazon Go site in the west London enclave of Notting Hill, more than two years after its first automated outlet opened in Seattle, Washington.The hi-tech store could ramp up pressure on traditional British supermarkets, which are already struggling to compete with the rise of discounters such as Aldi, Lidl and B\u0026ampM as well as the switch to online shopping, which is popular with shoppers but often unprofitable.At Amazon Go in the US, shoppers gain access by scanning their phone, with the Amazon Go app open, at the store’s entry gate. A series of cameras and sensors automatically log anything picked up in store to a shoppers’ Amazon online basket. Customers’ Amazon accounts are then billed when they leave the shop.There are now 25 Amazon Go stores, in Chicago, New York, Seattle and San Francisco, most of which are small sites focused on convenience foods. But Amazon recently opened a 1,000 sq metre outlet – in Seattle – more akin to a supermarket.Amazon has said that food is one of its key target markets in the UK, where it already operates seven grocery stores through Whole Foods Market, which it bought in 2017. It also delivers groceries via its Fresh service as well as to Prime subscribers.The company has also invested cash in Deliveroo, the London-based takeaway delivery service, although this tie-up is the subject of a competition watchdog inquiry which could force it to offload some of its stake.The Go store would be another high-profile move into the UK. But Brits may not fall instantly in love with an automated shop. “It’s brilliant technology and experience, but Amazon are not very good at running shops,” says Bryan Roberts, a retail analyst who has visited Amazon Go in the US. He says the American stores have been dogged by stock shortages and other issues. “If you have got a local captive audience, all of whom have got the app and can walk in and walk out, it’s great,” he says. But he suggests Amazon may struggle to draw in huge crowds prepared to sign up to an account.In the UK, Tesco and Sainsbury’s have both tested cashless stores in London. Sainsbury’s ditched its test after it found shoppers less than keen to sign up to its special app, which put off passing trade. Automated tills and other existing technologies are already quick to use, meaning there is little incentive for shoppers to sign up to something new.But attitudes may be beginning to change. As well as those two supermarkets, Waitrose and the Co-op have now launched or trialled apps that allow shoppers to pay using a mobile phone in their stores.Roberts suggests that Amazon may be using the Go store to market its technology to other retailers rather than aiming to open hundreds of its own sites. There are also rumours that Amazon may work with Morrisons, the Bradford-based supermarket that currently supplies goods to its Fresh service in the UK, to keep its British Go store supplied. It is an experiment that could bring yet more big changes to British retail."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acb22c5450f12e46d924c468b43d4419c6b1a063/0_0_3060_1836/master/3060.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5674754f9b6f8e98f79fd33236b5abdb","title":"coronavirus in an era of the well and unwell we turn to the state and find it lacking","story":"It’s only when we run out of luck that we comprehend how precarious life can beSpeaking to parliament in 1855 as the carnage of the Crimean war grew, the radical MP John Bright produced an imperishable image. “The angel of death has been abroad throughout the land, you may almost hear the beating of his wings.”Death’s wings are beating countless millions towards the world of the sick today. You may enter full of confidence. You may think good health is like a car, and a hospital is a garage where you can park your malfunctioning body for the professionals to fix. Your confidence comes from the luck of living in an advanced scientific society with history’s longest life expectancy and highest living standards. The world of the sick teaches you to dispense with certainties. You discover that your condition, or in my case the condition of someone you love, which seemed a temporary malfunction, is incurable or is possibly incurable, for no one really knows.Only the unlucky think about luck. Lucky people can fail to realise that luck exists. They think they have succeeded on merit, or they have thrived because of their good character or lovable personality. As comfortable people, they revolt against the thought that their comfort can ever end and their lives are contingent.You saw them out in force at the start of this crisis, although their number is falling by the hour. Bluff voices boomed that coronavirus was no worse than winter flu. We had any number of scare stories about BSE, the millennium bug and Sars in the past. They turned out to be nonsense, didn’t they? Keep calm and carry on. Go to races, go to the pub. It’s just politicians trying to frighten us into giving them more power. Like the global heating deniers they resemble, they live so unthinkingly with the material benefits science and technology have brought that they have come to believe they can ignore science that inconveniences them.At a subconscious level, I suspect they make the calculation that it will not matter if they’re wrong. The experts they disparage will find a way through with some clever technology or invention. They have yet to learn that the greatest ide is not between rich and poor, but between the healthy and the sick. They will learn one day for this is the ide everyone crosses in the end.Luck obsesses the world of the sick, which is just another way of saying that death obsesses us. Our doctors talk of probabilities. They don’t know why a treatment helps one person live a reasonable life but not another. There’s X chance you will get through this. There is Y chance that you will have Z more years of life. What you assumed to be the precise discipline of medicine blurs on close inspection into educated guesses. Just as victims of violent crime wonder what would have happened if they had not passed that pub, or the children of a parent who died young wonders how they would have turned out if their family had not fallen apart, so the world of the sick is a world of “what ifs”.Everyone is asking what if now. A virus without a vaccine, which proliferates undetected, and, as the experience of northern Italy shows, can overwhelm the health services of even prosperous countries, makes it the only question to ask. Maybe infection will feel no worse than a cold. Maybe you will find that only the old will die, and you won’t pass it on to kill an innocent stranger or someone you love. And if you are old, maybe it won’t kill you. I don’t often say this, but I feel sorry for a government having to deal with so many maybes.Having lived on the edge of the world of the sick for a decade, however, I wonder if our leaders realise how frightened people look to the state. Every crisis of the 21st century has proved the state’s centrality. After the 911 attacks, dealers ran away from danger, fire officers ran towards it. Central banks and governments were the only institutions that could bail out the world economy after the banking crisis of 2008. Today, the state’s strategies are our obsession. I am not saying the private sector and charities are irrelevant tech firms and supermarkets may play a sizeable role in getting us through. I’m simply saying that if you are sick and facing the prospect of death, the state is the only institution with the means and responsibility to help you.What else is there? Alternative health quacks are exploiting public fears, but only the desperate rely on them – and they will soon realise their mistake. Religion may comfort a few. But in Europe most agree with Philip Larkin’s dismissal of faith in Aubade, his great poem on the fear of death:No trick dispels. Religion used to try,Created to pretend we never die… The British government believes we are still the country of last month’s booming bluffers. It fears that, if it orders lockdowns now, fatigue will set in and the public will be breaking the curfews as the illness peaks. Perhaps it has more freedom than it imagines. Last month is another age, and the first thing everyone in the world of the sick learns is to put up with anything that might help them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18bc586e9794610320738aa48362cb06293bd975/0_162_1470_882/master/1470.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1e90ef70d09f28ad0e320531450ab38","title":"naomi campbell clean freak has last laugh with coronavirus chic","story":"For the moment, at least, this is what a world without live entertainment looks like. Sport is basically cancelled, and not because it posted an offensive tweet 11 years ago when it had 39 followers and an egg for an avatar. Tours have been pulled, festivals postponed, and cinematic releases pushed back indefinitely, to a time one can only assume is “post-doomsday”, when everyone finally fancies having the bejesus scared out of them again by something that is not the live news feed on their recently disinfected phones.For entertainment, I am left scrabbling for what I can get, and for a brief moment of respite from the onslaught of bad news, I have turned to the social media feeds of celebrities dealing with either having coronavirus, or trying not to get it, or trying to understand it.So far, Naomi Campbell has emerged as the Dame Vera Lynn of this present situation, entertaining the virtual troops with her “I have not come to play” approach to hygiene. She has posted pictures of herself in the full hazmat, covered from head to toe, goggles, face mask and all, while travelling through Los Angeles airport. “Safety First NEXT LEVEL,” she wrote, adding a thank you to Linda Evangelista, which makes me wonder if there’s an underground network of supermodels doling out protective clothing to the rich and beautiful.I have to admit, with only mild embarrassment, that this is not the first time I have thought of Campbell during this outbreak. Until very recently, I had an international flight planned, and I had already reminded myself of her infamous approach to inflight hygiene. In a video she posted to her YouTube channel last year, she got out a pair of gloves and a packet of Dettol wipes, and gave her first-class seat an astonishingly thorough wipe down. “I do not care what people think of me,” she said, as she cleaned. “It’s my health, and it makes me feel better.”I’m starting to wonder if Campbell should be fronting a How Clean Is Your House?-style show, in which she swabs and cleanses her way through this weird new world, telling us all not to touch our faces. Release date: postponed until at least 2021.After pouring out a spot of pancake batter for the departure of Sandi Toksvig, Great British Bake Off has announced that Little Britain’s Matt Lucas will be her replacement as co-host, joining Noel Fielding in the tent.The current run of Stand Up to Cancer Bake Off specials will be Toksvig’s last, and Lucas will step in for the 11th series, due to air in the summer. “I’m chuffed to bits to be joining the most delicious show on television,” he said. “And bearing in mind my love of cake, I’ve already ordered some much larger trousers in anticipation.”Bake Off certainly needed something to help its dough rise again. Once, its only issue was that Paul’s handshake had become more of a talking point that the pastries. But the last series was a disappointment, to many fans and viewers. The contestants were all too young, and it was sorely lacking in a couple of seen-it-all-before grannies who could show the Instagram bakers how to do it.The judges were too cutting, the tasks too tough and competitive, the challenges a world away from its “whip us up a nice Victoria sponge while we make a smutty joke about cream” origins. Bake Off was supposed to be nice, and watching people cry over split custard was never what it was there for.Still, plenty of people who thought the show would not survive its transition from BBC to Channel 4, from Mary Berry to Prue Leith, from Mel and Sue to Toksvig and Fielding. But, as unlikely a pairing as it first sounded, they made it work. And it will work again, particularly if they step back from being quite so hard on the participants. After all, the show is bigger than its parts, bigger, even, than the new trousers Lucas is having made.Any announcement that a much-loved videogame will be turned into a TV show or a film is usually about as promising as finding out that a successful British sitcom is being remade for a US audience. Yes, The Office, but for every show that worked, there are a thousand Skins and Inbetweeners, ideas that ended up so neutered you were desperate for any character to be allowed to say a single, even minor, rude word.That could be about to change, though, with news that the best game of all time is being adapted for the small screen. The Last Of Us is about a journey across post-apocalyptic America, after the world has been ravaged by an infectious mutant fungus – timely! – and it is being made for HBO, which suggests it will have the money it needs to make its post-social-distancing landscapes look spectacular.More impressively, it will be helmed by Craig Mazin, whose surname is also a review of the job he did when he wrote Chernobyl. Mazin will work with the game’s creative director, Neil Druckmann. “Getting a chance to adapt this breathtaking work of art has been a dream of mine for years, and I’m so honoured to do it in partnership with Neil,” he told the Hollywood Reporter. It could be a, er, game-changer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3857f51e2dba9c86e1c86b5e6f58ef8fd245b7f9/0_0_4922_3142/master/4922.jpg?width=645\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c4799fdae64a3aae87d921a99ded373 645w","title":"salford greenest city bristol brighton england wales","story":"The former ‘dirty old town’ has more energy-efficient homes, more green spaces, more recycling and lowest CO2 emissions, says studySalford may have been fondly dubbed a “dirty old town” by folk singer Ewan MacColl and depicted as full of smoky chimneys by LS Lowry, but new research has crowned it the greenest place to live in England and Wales.The city, part of Greater Manchester, is more sustainable than places such as Brighton, where Caroline Lucas is Britain’s only Green party MP, and Bristol, a former European Green Capital, according to a study to be released this week by the Centre for Thriving Places.In this socialist stronghold of the north-west – represented by the Momentum-backed Labour leadership hopeful Rebecca Long-Bailey – the leftwing council, run by Labour mayor Paul Dennett, is building the most energy-efficient new homes in England and Wales and preserving and creating more green space than any other council.The city also has lower-than-average CO2 emissions, lower-than-average energy consumption levels and higher-than-average recycling rates.“There have been a lot of innovative things going on in the north-west in terms of participatory democracy, community wealth-building and the environment,” said Liz Zeidler, chief executive of the Centre for Thriving Places. “Places such as Salford seem to be quite cleverly absorbing these ideas. Its leaders have been willing to try something new and now they are starting to see the results.”According to the study, the least sustainable area in England and Wales is Stockton-on-Tees in the north-east. It has well over double the average CO2 emissions, nearly half the average recycling rates, and fewer trees than most authorities.The full analysis – which rates 363 local authorities on 60 indicators covering sustainability, equality and local conditions – reveals that Richmond upon Thames offers the best quality of life overall. Residents of the affluent south London borough have the best mental and physical health, along with the most trusting neighbours.Stockton-on-Tees also has one of the worst scores overall. Its poorest children make less progress than those living in most other areas, while the scale of its health challenges dwarfs those found elsewhere. It has the largest life-expectancy gap in England and Wales, with people in deprived areas dying on average more than 16 years earlier than in the better-off parts of the borough.Brent said its good schools enabled equality of opportunity. “The other secret to our success is that we know that ersity is our greatest strength, so we proudly celebrate it,” said its deputy council leader, Margaret McLennan.Stockton-on-Tees said it accepted it had problems, but the study did not reflect the area’s many strengths. “We’re the economic powerhouse of the Tees Valley, contributing about a third of its economic output, and we’re home to internationally recognised brands,” said Bob Cook, leader of the council. “But we do, of course, have our challenges. We have significant areas of deprivation and serious health inequalities.”He added that the area’s energy-intensive industries were meeting government emissions targets, and its weekly bin collections were popular with residents."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71218c0d4064855e2f0c261031338bda47b45bd3/220_62_2710_1626/master/2710.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2abdbc4ab46621466befbcfd9d389889","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The pick of the world’s best flora and fauna photos, including the last female white giraffe and boxing hares"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73241643073395e33264860b1e19a0ef024b7be4/1_0_5620_3373/master/5620.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86a356052f7a2278bf3c97fd6197db6f","title":"life on a plate sara cox lamb liquorice kimchi modelling radio  back in time","story":"The broadcaster reminisces about growing up on a farm, eating fried rice for breakfast, and her love of liquorice pipesFrom our farm’s kitchen window you could see the coal bunker where my brothers bred rabbits and mice to sell to the pet shop.

Dad’s a decent vintage nowadays, but when I phone him up, he’s still out on the tractor in all weathers, because there’s no staying under his duvet when it’s tipping down outside.I used to get taken around the fish and fruit markets in Bolton, where I lived. I was seven or eight and with my mum, who was 4ft 11, and we’d be in this battle of the matriarchs. There’d be a bustle and surge, quite chaotic and loud, with stall owners shouting: “Caulis, two for 50!” All quite overwhelming, especially in the smelly fish market. I’d be given little “crab sticks” in a polythene bag as a treat, although I don’t think any real crab would have been within 100 yards of them.In the 80s, mum used to make a beautiful beef in red wine sauce, which I thought very exotic. And an incredible chilli con carne, with baked beans so it wasn’t too spicy for us. Later, when I asked for the recipes, she said: “I don’t know – they were Colman’s or Schwartz’s packet mixes.” It completely ruined it for me. I thought she’d hand down some secret list of herbs and spices from around the world. But she’s got a good touch, my mother – I don’t know if it’s the temperature or the salt, but I can always tell her food.I love a jar of cockles. I love anything in vinegar – beetroot, little silverskin onions, cornichons – I’m forever grazing on stuff like that, fingers in a jar. My fondness for cockles probably came from trips to the seaside – Blackpool or Morecambe where they’d serve them in polystyrene trays with a cocktail stick.When I was a teenager I managed to be a vegetarian for a few days but my heart wasn’t in it. My dad roasted a leg of lamb and I caved.There’s not a lot of food eaten by models. I didn’t really eat. You’re surrounded by size six, size eight girls the whole time and I smoked back then so it was just lots of Marlboro Lights and slimming soups. Although I did eat some amazing food in South Korea. I was given a Korean kimchi beef dish with a lot of stringy things and glistening onions and I absolutely loved that. But we’d go off to model and stay away the night and were given a sort of fish soup for breakfast. It had tiny spider-sized crabs in it. So, often I had the fried rice with a fried egg on top.When you eat you naturally produce saliva so when you’re presenting a radio show you don’t want to be sounding like that dribbling Spitting Image puppet of Roy Hattersley. But I might have almonds knocking around.I’ll tell you what I really love – liquorice pipes. I’ve got a box of them and I often offer them to other DJs. It’s said that too much liquorice increases hyper-tension, which I have. When I told a friend who’s a GP, she replied: “You’d have to eat a skip full to have that effect.”For Back In Time, the series, we did Back In Time For Tea. It was set in 1910 or whatevers and I inflated a pig’s bladder for a boy to kick around and I tried tripe for the first time, which I wasn’t wild on itself, but it was in bread crumbs and deep-fried. If you put bread crumbs into a deep fried flip-flop it would taste ok.I just got my first deep-fat fryer. I feel like I’m going back in time a bit by buying that. I’ve cooked chips in it twice so far and they were lovely. My nana used to cook chips which were soft and cooked in the middle, but still pale outside. With fried egg. And you can’t get any better than that. I think it’ll have to be my last meal – fried egg and chips. At my funeral I’d like them to play the music from the Hovis ad.I don’t know if it’s because I’d been running around a camp site and beach all day as a kid, absolutely famished, but I ate freshly fished mackerel one day and I’ve been on a mackerel pilgrimage ever since.Wine. I’ve got that Vivino app. It’s lethal if you like wine because if you have a nice bottle in a restaurant and take a photo of the label, when you’re in the taxi on the way homeyou end up buying a case of six.I just think northern food is just more substantial and sturdier. So a good potato pie. With a meat pie, just in case. Or I make a veg curry or fish pie.

Bright-eyed, if not absolutely zealous, they spoke of tinned haricot beans as the future, and of fresh orange juice as (RIP) the past. After this, someone made a joke about scurvy, at which everyone laughed rather too loudly. But the moment swiftly passed. Our dinner – beef with roast potatoes and hispi cabbage – had begun arriving at our table in quantities generous enough that our talk had suddenly started to seem a bit ludicrous.On the way home, I laughed about this: how we love a drama. If I could have remembered it, I would have hummed the theme to Survivors, the 70s TV show about a plague that has spread across the world thanks to air travel. But the next day, it was my turn to start worrying about vitamin tablets and shelf lives. At Ocado, Britain’s biggest online supermarket, shares had apparently jumped thanks to the fact that so many customers were placing “particularly large” orders. Delivery slots were selling out. Suddenly, I was receiving the message with zero distortion: basically, only a fool would risk having to go into a 14-day quarantine without ready supplies of – we’re talking about Ocado here! – organic couscous and those new-fangled bags of frozen avocado I’ve seen advertised.To be honest, I was much more amazed by this fact than I was by the revelation that people I know are hoarding fusilli. No one could be a pickier shopper than me: I’ve only to see a melon to sniff it. And yet, I always shop online now. There are still things I only buy in my local shops – croissants, cheese, salad, herbs – and our milk is delivered in glass bottles. For everything else, however, I get out my laptop. This saves me money – I make fewer impulse buys online – and it means, too, that I don’t use my car for a short journey (to be as green as possible, I only book a delivery if the van is already in my area). Above all, it gives me the gift of time. I can order my shopping in hotel rooms when I’m working away, or at home late at night, and this has changed my life to the point where bricks and mortar supermarkets have become almost alien to me. I can’t seem to navigate them any more.Earlier this year, I walked around a Co-op, dazed and slightly confused, wondering where the nutmeg was, and longing all the while for my virtual basket. At the till, I kept having to run back for things – items my online account would have reminded me I needed, and which I was going to struggle to carry anyway. I was in Yorkshire, and the woman serving me was patient and lovely. But for all that I’m a deracinated northerner, I found to my surprise that her accent was not much more comforting to me at this point in my life than another all-too-familiar sound: that of plastic boxes being humped from van to pavement. Thunk, thunk they go – a noise that turns my thoughts inevitably to supper and, just lately, to my own (I admit it) nascent stockpile. It is rather teabag heavy at the moment. Nevertheless, it grows exponentially, with every other unsettling headline."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/441bb9e68143d8c175b724217c79bf57bd6c6cca/0_1004_3491_2095/master/3491.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9da9d8442598c5c9c9ede99372a966f","title":"pitta patter yotam ottolenghis recipes for homemade pitta with chicken skewers or herb fritters","story":"How to make perfect pitta, and two fillings to stuff into them: seven-spice chicken skewers and tabbouleh fritters with a quick chilli sauceWhat you choose to stuff your pitta with is totally your own business, but I beg you to consider having the correct ensemble of elements to hand: something bulky, something saucy, something crisp, something tart … and lots and lots of flavour!A perfectly balanced pitta sandwich is as close to sublime as you’ll get from a bunch of unassuming ingredients. So, today I give you the ultimate pitta, with just the right kind of fillings to stuff it with.These pittas are notably light and airy, so they’ll absorb sauces and juices like sponges. Fill them with the seven-spice chicken or tabbouleh fritters , or whenever you’ve got a great filling in need of a bready home. Get ahead by making the dough the night before and leaving it to prove in the fridge overnight bring it up to room temperature before you work with it again.240ml lukewarm water2 tsp fast-action dried yeast2 tsp caster sugar300g plain flour, plus extra for dusting50g wholemeal flour1 tsp salt1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for oilingPut the water in a small bowl, sprinkle over the yeast and sugar, and leave for five to six minutes, until it reacts and turns foamy.Put both flours and the salt in a stand mixer with the dough hook attached and mix on low speed to combine. Add the yeast mixture and oil, turn the speed to medium-high and knead for seven minutes, until the dough is smooth, elastic and a bit sticky. Transfer to an oiled bowl, cover with a damp tea towel and leave in a warm place to rise for one to two hours, until doubled in size. (Or prove overnight in the fridge.)Divide the dough into six pieces weighing roughly 100g each. Lightly flour a clean work surface with flour and mould each piece into a ball. Cover with a tea towel and leave to rest for another 20 minutes.Heat the oven to its highest setting and put in a large tray to heat up. Cut out a couple pieces of baking paper roughly the same size as the tray and sprinkle with flour. Working two at a time, use a lightly floured rolling pin to roll out the balls into roughly 12cm-diameter rounds on the paper. Transfer the paper and bread rounds to the heated tray and bake for four to five minutes, until lightly golden and puffy. Transfer to a clean plate or bowl and cover with a tea towel to keep warm while you repeat with the rest of the dough.Lebanese seven-spice is a blend that’s used liberally in the Middle East, especially in meat marinades. Serve this chicken with store-bought or homemade pitta (see previous recipe), a simple crisp salad, the tahini sauce and some pickles to make the ultimate pitta sandwich.For the chicken700g boneless and skinless chicken thighs, each cut into 3-4 pieces1 tbsp Lebanese seven-spice¼ tsp ground turmeric1 tsp paprika1 tsp ground cumin3 tbsp olive oil70g Greek-style yoghurt1 lemon – half juiced, to get 1 tbsp, the other half reserved to finishSalt and black pepperFor the sauce80g good-quality tahini 1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed1½ tbsp lemon juicePut all the chicken ingredients (except the reserved lemon half) in a large bowl with a teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper, and mix to combine. Cover with a plate and marinate for at least half an hour (or refrigerate overnight, if you want to get ahead).Make the sauce by whisking all the ingredients with a quarter-teaspoon of salt and 70ml water, until you have a smooth, pourable sauce. It will thicken as it sits.Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan) 425Fgas 7 and put a well-greased griddle pan on a high flame. Skewer the marinated chicken on to four roughly 23cm-long metal skewers (or soaked wooden skewers). Once the griddle is very hot, grill the chicken two skewers at a time (or as many as will fit comfortably) for eight to 10 minutes in total, turning regularly, until well-charred all over.Transfer the skewers to an oven tray lined with greaseproof paper and bake for 20 minutes, or until cooked through. Squeeze over the reserved lemon half and serve warm with pittas, salad, pickles and the sauce.These herby fritters can be served just as they are with a squeeze of lemon, or with the quick chilli sauce. A third and more filling option would be to stuff them into fresh pitta, drizzle with the tahini sauce from the previous recipe and a spoonful of the chilli sauce, and finish with a few slices of tomato or cucumber. The sauce keeps in a sealed jar in the fridge for up to a week, so double the quantities, if you fancy.Prep 25 minCook 45 minMakes 8, to serve 470g bulgur wheatSalt and black pepper200g baby spinach50g parsley, roughly chopped20g mint leaves, picked½ red onion, peeled and roughly chopped (60g net weight)1 garlic clove, peeled and roughly chopped1 tsp ground allspice1 tsp ground cinnamon1 tbsp lemon zest75ml olive oil3 large eggsFor the quick chilli sauce3 tbsp olive oil2 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped½ onion, peeled and roughly chopped (75g)1 tbsp tomato paste2 fresh red chillies, roughly chopped, seeds and all (20g)2 vine tomatoes, roughly chopped, seeds and all (200g) 1½ tbsp apple cider vinegarPut the bulgur in a small saucepan for which you have a tight-fitting lid, and add 75ml water and a quarter-teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, cover, turn off the heat and leave to sit and steam gently for 10 minutes. Fluff up the bulgur with a fork, then set aside to cool slightly.Meanwhile, make the sauce. Put the oil in a small frying pan on a medium-high heat and, once hot, add the garlic and onion. Fry, stirring occasionally, for five minutes, until softened and lightly coloured. Add the tomato paste, cook, stirring often, for a minute longer, then add the chillies, turn off the heat and leave to cool for five minutes. Tip the mix into a food processor, pulse until finely chopped, then add the tomatoes, vinegar and half a teaspoon of salt, and blitz smooth.Blanch the spinach in boiling water for 20 seconds, or until just wilted, then drain.

Perhaps scrubbing Euro 2020 could provide more time to complete the season into the summer but that is also a giant ‘if’. What if the league cannot be finished?“As games in both the Premier League and in the EFL are affected, the only fair and reasonable thing to do is declare the whole season null and void. Who knows who would have gone down or come up if the games have not actually been played in full?”Brady conceded that any cancellation would be “a huge blow to Liverpool, who might be robbed of their first title in 30 years,” and that it would cause financial issues for many clubs, and the possibility of legal battles over relegation, promotion and European places.“There are, of course, financial implications, wages and transfer debts must be paid and there is lost broadcast revenue, lost matchday income but this pales into insignificance as the health and wellbeing of everyone must come first,” Brady added.Brady’s comments have attracted criticism on social media, with BT Sport presenter Des Kelly labelling them “shameless”, although Piers Morgan tweeted his support for her stance, saying it was “the ONLY fair thing to do”.West Ham are 16th in the suspended Premier League table with 27 points, and outside of the relegation zone on goal difference."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5dd081e2256e9bdd2fded7bf5ddae14d3901ef6/0_9_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=884ee178720247d4d99d1f0b32a80549","title":"what is it like to cover a football game behind closed doors","story":"Football with no fans – or very few at least – is very different, as Manchester United’s Europa League game against Lask showedCome and enter the hidden cabaret behind the closed doors of Manchester United’s 5-0 thrashing of Lask in Thursday’s Europa League last-16 first leg. The show commenced at 6.55pm local time at the Linzer Stadion and was a veritable offering of vaudeville.The bill featured two garden-hopping United supporters who broke-and-entered near Sergio Romero’s goal during the first half. It featured representatives of a United YouTube fan channel singing proudly about Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s men from the media seats as the written press composed live pieces. It had the vocal Bruno Fernandes urging Daniel James (and others) to up their game against the Austrian Bundesliga leaders. And there was a show-stopping vignette from Solskjær after final whistle.It offered up a prevailing theme, too, a unifying leitmotif that tied the various acts together: the very real possibility that this was to be United’s on-field swan-song before the season was paused due to fears regarding the spread of coronavirus.All of this was reminiscent of Warren Buffet’s famous diktat. “Only when the tide goes out do you discover who’s swimming naked,” the billionaire philanthropist said once. Or in this case: when the Linzer was empty apart from a smattering of Lask enthusiasts you saw things you might not normally see.On 12 October 2018 England played Croatia in a behind-closed-doors “ghost game” at the Stadion Rujevica and those present remarked how clearly the players could be heard, with Jordan Henderson to the fore for Gareth Southgate’s side.In Austria’s third city United’s sergeant major was Fernandes. His “encouragement” of James and others was vociferous when they failed to operate at his elevated pace or match the second-sight passes that cast him as an in-match seer.In support was Romero who, despite being David De Gea’s understudy, had no qualms about barking at his defence even as the two trespassing fans negotiated backyards to gain entrance to the Linzer. When they were accosted by security and hurled out, one attempted an encore and on re-trespassing was arrested by the local constabulary and had to stump up a €30 fine. It was all quite surreal.Also making themselves heard during United’s canter of a victory were Scott McTominay and Harry Maguire. The former is a 23-year-old whose discourse during the build-up was as articulate as his midfield scheming was dominant against the side who operate on a budget equivalent to a League Two club.Yet whisper this: Maguire might have been more strident considering he is the captain and so team totem and nominated alpha-male. Because despite being a yeoman-type with a no-nonsense style straight from centre-back central casting he proved no martinet with his troops. Instead it was Fernandes, the shoo-in to wear the armband when Maguire cannot, who was United’s Brian Blessed: his voice constantly booming around the pitch of the deserted arena.This near-canter from first whistle to last could also explain Solskjær’s dormouse-quiet on the bench, with his coaching brains-trust of Mike Phelan, Michael Carrick and Kieran McKenna following suit. After all, why holler and scream when Odion Ighalo performs a Harlem Globetrotter, three-touch juggle before hammering in a volley on 33 minutes? Or Daniel James breaks a six-month scoring cessation during the second half for a fourth of the campaign?The two present from the YouTube channel were loudest of all and it was intriguing to learn that United’s desire to connect with fans this way moved the club to grant a media pass to a spectacle for which only 500 were allowed entry.Afterwards one asked Solskjær a cute poser about the unsettled Paul Pogba still being at United next season – “yes” was the answer – but the highlight came when a journalist put another question about whether “Paul” would be fit soon.Solskjær – as bright as his 11-match unbeaten side are currently performing – looked at the hack, who is also called Paul, and said: “You mean yourself?” This was followed by a twinkle of the eye, laughter from the media corps, and a follow-up comment from the manager. “I thought you were talking about yourself in the third person,” he joked.It was an apt way to bring down the curtain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01159a64957f83dc5826cf93f91d983029e7a615/0_170_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ccf6b911deb990128c15f4c6c571e807","title":"an artists home by the sea","story":"Finding inspiration in a new timber-framed home-cum-studio on the Kent coastYou see the most remarkable skies here – like a miracle of heaven and earth together,” says artist Rachael Dickens of the view from her newly built home, between Herne Bay and Reculver on the Kent coast. A keen outdoor swimmer whose work is often inspired by water, Rachael was first drawn to this site by its setting. “I walk on the beach and swim in the sea nearly every day,” she says, “and the vision for the house was very much about being able to see the sea.” The result is an arresting contemporary home whose jet-black weatherboarding and corrugated roof echo the tarred fishermen’s huts and net lofts typically found in nearby Whitstable.Rachael came across the plot by accident during a day trip to Whitstable with her sister in 2014. At the time, she was house-hunting without success in south London, after selling her home in Sydenham with a view to moving closer to Brockwell lido. (Rachael has been cold water swimming since 2006 and helped to reform the lido’s original 1930s swimming club: The Brockwell Icicles.) While walking along the east Kent coastline, looping back from Reculver, the sisters stumbled across a small 1930s bungalow for sale right by the shore, but it was in need of modernisation.“It wasn’t a nice house, but it had the most fantastic views and quite a big garden, so I knew I could build a studio at the back,” Rachael recalls. “And because I had done some building work before, I could imagine how it could be refurbished.” She quickly made an offer and moved in that October.As her original intention had been to remodel the house, Rachael commissioned a local architect, Michael Shoobridge, to draw up plans for a fresh internal layout. However, when builders began work in 2015, it became clear that the bungalow’s timber frame was perilously rotten and it would have to be knocked down. “I was a bit terrified – but excited as well – when I found out about the demolition,” says Rachael, who has two grown-up children still living in London, and shares her home with a Staffordshire terrier cross named Zoot. “It did make it a lot more expensive.” A buy-to-let flat she had just purchased in Westgate-on-Sea had to be sold to pay for the project. Meanwhile, Michael Shoobridge revised his plans to create a new timber-framed building, designed around Rachael’s twin passions for the outdoors and art.Having already set up a studio in the garden (built by Homestead Garden Rooms, complete with shower), Rachael made this her home for a year as she project-managed the construction. “My aunt, uncle and cousin were all architects my dad built concrete and steel structures as a civil engineer and my grandfather was the son in the building firm Bailey, Dickens \u0026amp Son, so I have a lineage of ideas about form, structure and materials,” she explains. “It was fun – and I had every faith in the builders.” The finished two-bedroom house, built by Chris Dew at San Ris, is ideally suited to her way of life. The ground floor has floor-to-ceiling windows to the front and rear, so that from her garden workspace she can look straight through the house and out to the sea.The vaulted, open-plan living room and kitchen is painted white and has a pale plywood floor, making the most of the natural light. To keep within budget, the kitchen cupboards from the original bungalow were retained and repainted, then teamed with a reclaimed timber worktop from a school science lab. Rachael’s collections of vintage finds and contemporary art, displayed on midcentury Ladderax and G-Plan units or floating shelves, lend vibrant colour to the decorative scheme. Some of her own paintings appear here, and throughout the house, alongside works by south London artists Liz Chisholm and Christopher Noulton, plus cushions by weaver Margo Selby, whose studio is in Whitstable. A restored pinball machine, from RG Scott’s antiques emporium in Margate, adds a jaunty touch.The theme of seaside nostalgia continues into the snug, – a second sitting room, tucked away on the ground floor – where kitsch curios, such as antique shell art, nautical embroideries and 1960s ceramics, are displayed against a warm backdrop of unpainted plaster. Rachael’s wit and creativity are further in evidence in the downstairs bathroom, inspired by the house of architect César Manrique on Lanzarote, which opens out on to the garden. Rachael sourced some potato crates from Quex Park in Birchington and, in exchange for a donation, broke them up to use as cladding for the bath and WC. “All that white porcelain is really boring,” she smiles. A lid made from a salvaged door conceals the bath when not in use.The first-floor bedroom gives a sense of being afloat on an ocean liner, with its generous glass-sided balcony, beside which stands a stack of time-worn leather suitcases. From the bed, the marine outlook extends across the front garden, which is filled with hardy, salt-resistant plants, interwoven with items found on the beach, such as a totemic driftwood pillar, which Rachael thinks was once part of Herne Bay pier.Currently, her artwork is prompted by the surprising things she discovers washed ashore. “I find scraps of cloth, which were obviously once clothing, and it makes me wonder whose clothes they were and how far they have travelled through the tumbling oceans to land on my beach.” These fragments are then incorporated into stitched-cloth pieces, evoking human vulnerability, which have featured in exhibitions across Kent. In addition to a recent series of ceramics exploring the experiences of displaced families, she makes silver boat and bronze anchor pendants in support of Kent Refugee Action Network.Following her move, Rachael quickly became involved in the Whitstable arts scene and opens her doors every autumn for East Kent Open Houses to welcome admirers of both her work and unique home. Among her future plans for the property is an extension across the back, to create a third bedroom and yoga studio. A trained yoga teacher in both Sivananda and Kundalini, Rachael spends time in India, continuing her practice.The artist considers her regular sea swims, accompanied by Zoot, also to be a meditation. “Moving here has been the best thing ever,” she confirms. “Just getting out into the open so calms the spirit. Swimming daily is a fantastic ritual. This is a very special place.”East Kent Open Houses takes place on 10-11, 17-18 and 24-25 October (ekoh.org.uk).

Now he’s photographing others with alopecia, capturing them as they appear when they wake up and as they face the world. Interviews by  Caroline Bannock“It’s like a gun going off, and once that’s happened there’s no going back.” This is how  photographer Graeme Robertson describes the onset of alopecia. Robertson developed it 17 years ago. He was 23 and covering the Iraq war, during which he witnessed the 2003 bombing of the UN building in Baghdad that killed 22 people. “I was having lunch opposite, then there were bodies everywhere,” he recalls. A few days later, “I was in the shower, when I got out, I shaved, and a 50p-size clump came off my beard.”He entered a middle phase, where he had half a moustache, half a head of hair, half a beard, which he got around by shaving daily. However, the psychological impact of losing his eyebrows and eyelashes was significant. “When you lose eyelashes and start getting sore eyes, you lose everything. You either have to accept that there’s something different about you, or go the opposite way and drive yourself insane about how you look or feel.”Having come to terms with his hair loss, Robertson has started documenting the experiences of others. “When it was happening, I didn’t understand what was going on,” he says. “I wanted to help people who were going through it. It started as a side project then turned into something in-depth, and I saw how many people were struggling.”I was eight months old when I developed alopecia and had no hair until I was about three. Then, from the age of three to 13, I had tiny bald patches behind my ears. I used to think it was the worst thing ever. At 13, it all fell out really quickly. I ended up with nothing. I think it was the stress of going to secondary school that triggered it. And being a teenager your hormones are changing, too.At school I didn’t want to be different, so I tried to hide it. Wearing a wig was horrendous. I was constantly scared: what if someone pulls it? What if someone thinks it’s funny? I’d get comments such as, “She’s more bald than my dad.” At the time, I couldn’t talk about it. I just sobbed. It got to the point where I wouldn’t get out of bed. I wouldn’t eat, I wouldn’t open my blinds. I didn’t want to talk to anyone.I dropped out of school when I was 15. I was a mess and I didn’t know what to do with myself. My mam’s a hairdresser, so I started working with her, and at first I loved being able to do all these different things with everybody’s hair, but over time it got harder. I switched to working in bars and restaurants instead, and started seeing a reiki healer. It sounds too good to be true, but she got rid of all my pain. Since then my confidence has just grown.One summer, the place where I was working was boiling and rammed. I whipped my hair off, put it in the cellar and nobody batted an eyelid. I feel as if I just woke up one day and something had clicked. I’ve heard all the names that anyone’s going to call me by now. If they see me as “that baldy lass”, so what?Instagram helped, too. There are many different types of hair loss, whether that be patches or total baldness. There’s everything there for people to see. I model for a wig company, and at first I was scared about the pictures being posted. Then I thought, why am I bothered? I want them to see how happy I am. I don’t want to be that depressed person who loses their hair, I want to be that young girl who inspires people to be who they are.Having alopecia and being in relationships has never been a problem. I’m gay and it’s easier being with a girl. Girls are more understanding. I’ve got a drawer full of wigs. One day I’ve got brown hair, the next I’ve got pink. When I first lost my hair, I felt as if my identity had been ripped away. Now I can be who I want to be.I used to have a very luscious beard and my alopecia began with a fingerprint-sized hole on my chin. I actually found it endearing. I would walk around work and say: “Can you believe this?” Shortly afterwards, I moved to Berlin for a promotion, and within six months I needed to shave completely. Then I got a patch around the crown of my head. I went to the barber and it was a really uncomfortable experience. He showed me the back of my head in the mirror and there were many patches forming. I realised that this was going to change my life permanently.When I came back to London for my Christmas break, I went to the local barbershop with one of my best friends, and got my head shaved. I remember seeing a mole on the back of my head for the first time, which was interesting. Then I walked out, feeling very cold and a little bit shaken.I think I had a genetic predisposition to alopecia, because there are autoimmune diseases in my family. But I also had a really traumatic year while I was losing my hair. I was adjusting to living in a new country my long-term relationship fell apart I lost my dog. Suddenly I was single, without any friends. I was withdrawn for a while. I was mourning, essentially. And then I was dealing with this hair loss.For a while I tried very hard to reverse it naturally. For three months I gave up all of the good stuff in life: cigarettes, alcohol, sugar – even lots of vegetables that are considered inflammatory. I tried yoga and meditation.Now, I’ve come out the other side and realised my own peace of mind is more important than sacrificing many things in the hope that I will get some regrowth. I have no way of knowing when or if I will get any, and I am OK with that, at least for now.I had a relatively weak hairline prior to that, so I don’t miss the hair on my head very much. But I miss my beard and my facial hair. I can’t lie about that. When you lose your eyebrows, it tips over into a space where people think that you are sick.But you have to see the funny side. I live in Berlin, and the clubs there are notoriously difficult to get into, but having no eyebrows helps you get through the door. Online dating is a lot more difficult, because it is a purely visual medium. The best chance of meeting somebody is just being out and living life.Paradoxically, I am probably less self-conscious now. I think back to how I was, clinging on to that rubbish hairline. Now, I just find that hilarious. There is something liberating about shedding those concerns about how you look.My alopecia started six months after I had my second child. I had an itchy patch at the back that I kept scratching. I thought it was normal postpartum hair loss. I was in denial. I kept thinking: it’s fine, it will grow back. Then one morning when I started to brush my hair, it was coming out in clumps. Four weeks later, I thought, sod it, it’s got to come off. So, I shaved it all off and raised more than £2,000 for Teenage Cancer Trust.When I found out that it wasn’t going to grow back, it was a blow. Your hair is a part of your personality. I was always known for my really long, dark hair and I used to wear a huge bun at work. When I went back after maternity leave, I hadn’t told anyone and they said: “Oh my God, are you OK? Are you ill?” I just didn’t want to wear a wig. I thought I would embrace this and be me.My hair was my thing – I never cut it – so it took me a long time to get used to looking at myself in the mirror. But I kept telling myself it was just a look. Some women choose to shave their heads. Losing my brows and lashes affected me more, because no one would choose to shave off their eyebrows and have no eyelashes. I would take those back in an instant over my head hair.Alopecia is a strange condition that nobody knows much about. It doesn’t cause physical pain and it’s not life-threatening, but people don’t realise the mental impact. One of my biggest fears was that my husband would not find me attractive any more. It must be hard to be with someone who looks completely different from when you met them. He’s been amazing, but when it came to having sex I felt really unattractive. I just didn’t feel very womanly.I still get that sometimes, but I’ve realised you can be bald and beautiful, and feel sexy. You just have to learn to trick your mind, to tell yourself that. I wear bigger earrings to compensate for the lack of hair. And I can still wear my uniform, put my red lipstick on and be “the different one” at work. People used to say: “Oh, Rima with the hair.” Now I’m known for being the only bald female crew member out of 4,000.When you lose your hair, it’s like losing your identity, really, and you have to get to know a whole new self. It does teach you who you are. Alopecia doesn’t define my life, but it has made me realise what is important: my husband, my children, my confidence.I started losing my hair during my GCSEs, with a 2p-piece-sized patch on the back of my head. I just remember crying and crying, and then eventually going to the doctor. I was revising and very depressed. I wanted to be an actor, and my dad had said: “No, you can’t. It’s the nearest thing to prostitution.” We were a very religious family, and I made the connection that, because my hair was falling out, God must be punishing me. My dad had this traditional West Indian mindset that “your hair is your beauty”.In my teens I always had afros and plaits, so you couldn’t see the alopecia. I shaved my head occasionally, and for my wedding, I was fine in front of hundreds of people in a big white dress, with a bald head and an ornate crown. I asked my husband: “How was I so strong then?” and he said: “You just loved being different.” But you can be a confident person and then something happens, and you think, I can’t face it today. In the end, losing my hair took away my career. The whole thing about acting is your image. To walk in the door with nothing… I just couldn’t do it.When I had children, the wigs came out. I didn’t want to look weird for them. I’d moved into a new area and the last thing I wanted was to stand out. At the playgroups, I was often the only black woman there. My husband is a white, middle-class man who is Oxford-educated, and I didn’t want to have an impact on his career. I was playing the dutiful wife. It feels silly to say that alopecia robs you of your identity, but you just don’t recognise yourself. When I put the wig on, I thought, oh, I remember her.I didn’t tell anyone my hair wasn’t real for years. I was clutching on to my hair on windy days, smiling when people said: “You’ve changed your hair!” thinking, really? You don’t know? Then I went to see the film Black Panther, and there is a lovely scene where Danai Gurira’s character takes her wig off and throws it across the room. I just thought: yes! Now I have stopped wearing a wig, because I felt I was living a lie.At first I was terrified, but I love being bald. This summer when I went “topless” I was able to spend the whole two weeks in the pool. And whenever there is another bald black woman, they tend to come up and we have a lovely chat.You have to be strong, because people stare. You think: why are they staring? Oh yes, I’m black. And bald. I forgot. I do a lot of work in schools and there’s no better education than seeing a black woman who can speak in public, who is bald, and it is normal. I hope that I empower people. I look good without a wig. I’m happy.My alopecia started more than three years ago. I was working in a job with some very burned-out co-workers, and I was badly bullied. I was young, idealistic and hopeful about where I wanted my life to go, so I wasn’t ready for that kind of experience. I began to notice little patches, and at the time I thought it was nothing. I thought it was stress-related and that it would go away.In the subsequent two years, those patches became bigger, then I got some regrowth and it fell out again. The uncertainty was difficult. I was very paranoid. I was obsessed with this idea that everyone was staring at me. Every day I’d cover my hair over the bald patches, and pencil in eyebrows.By this time I was working in refugee camps in Larissa in northern Greece, and it was very difficult to acknowledge my own struggle. I was waking up with a pillow full of hair, then doing stressful humanitarian work. There was shame that I was even struggling, then the shame of looking so different, and feeling so weird and alone. I couldn’t talk to anyone about it because the situations we were facing were so much bigger than mine.I left Greece after realising that my health was really being affected by the stress. I went back to my parent’s house for the first time in 10 years and lived there. By then, my hair was falling out in clumps and I decided to shave it off. Since doing that, it hasn’t always been easy, but I feel much more in control. I took charge of it rather and being a victim.I had very curly hair that no wigs can really imitate. Trying to “own” my baldness is the way I cope with it. I wear more makeup now than I did before and I wear more statement earrings. Seeing other women with buzzed heads or who rock their baldness is empowering. I date men and women, and I think with women it’s much more acceptable to look different. With men, there seems to be a more shallow idea of what women should look like, or so I think.I had eating disorders in my 20s, so I’ve never really felt so comfortable in my body. Alopecia has forced me to confront my own image so, in a way, I’m grateful for it. The only hair I didn’t lose was my armpit hair, which is quite funny. Now I’m very proud of it.My hair first fell out when I was 30, and it made me really miserable. I tried a couple of medical routes and quickly realised nothing could be done. I felt awful. I didn’t really talk to anyone about it and nobody saw me without hair, even my husband. I hid it away. I thought I looked like an alien.I had a job in a customer-facing role in a bank, so I had to literally put on my wig and put on a face and be the person that people were expecting to see. The first day I went in with my wig, this guy came in and said: “Oh Elena, what have you done to your hair?” I burst into floods of tears, ran to the loo and was there for about half an hour, trying to compose myself. Also, when you’ve got a bit of hair, you don’t have control of where your wig is. I was always worrying about whether it was straight or not. It puts you in a state of heightened anxiety.At work I was putting on a brave front, but at home I wasn’t. I couldn’t look at myself in the mirror for a long time, because I didn’t recognise myself. Then my hair started to grow back and I was able to ditch the wigs, until about three years ago when it started to thin again. For a couple of weeks I was in utter despair. I thought, I can’t face going through this again: it’s so unfair. Just go away. Leave me alone.By then I was a mum. So I thought, actually, no. Hair is important, but there’s more to life. And I shaved my head.The internet didn’t exist when I had alopecia the first time, but when I Googled it this time I was amazed. There’s so much stuff. I started a support group in Jersey and it’s had an amazingly positive impact on my life. It’s lovely to be able to help people get out of the place of despair where everybody starts, to a place of acceptance and happiness. Now, putting my hair on is the last thing I’ll do before I walk out of the door, and quite often I don’t notice whether I have it on or not. I keep my wig in the kitchen on a champagne bottle. Why not?I’m grateful I’ve got alopecia. Beauty is not all about the outside. And being able to teach that to my daughter, who’s growing up in a complicated world, is a gift.If you’re an Asian woman growing up, your mum will always make you plait your hair. In the 1970s it was two plaits with a centre parting, and my parting started getting wider. I thought it was linked to eczema, so I modified my hairstyle to accommodate it. Then in my 20s, the doctor said: “It’s alopecia. There’s no cure for it, it’s to do with your immune system.” Losing my husband at a younger age was probably the biggest trigger, but it didn’t affect me until about two years afterwards. At one point my mum and sister were poorly I was busy looking after them and my hair came back for two years. Then as soon as they got better, it started to fall out again. I was at my baldest in 2017. I couldn’t look in the mirror, because it just wasn’t me. After my eyelashes fell out, my eyes were swollen all the time, and I was getting allergic reactions. It’s a constant battle.Wearing a wig is like wearing a tight swimming cap. I can’t wait to get it off. Sometimes at work, I have to go to the toilet, take it off, hang it up, calm my head down, then put it all back on. And wigs stop you from doing certain things. It was hard to date. I used to sabotage relationships, purely because I’d be thinking, how the hell do I explain? He’ll go to kiss me and the wig will come off. The first time I was with my current partner and my scarf came off, I couldn’t stop crying because I just didn’t want him to see the real me. I felt embarrassed. I felt ugly. But on the other hand, I wanted somebody to give me a chance to show that this doesn’t define me.I wear my wig because I don’t want people looking at me and making judgments. People see guys with bald heads and think it’s part of the ageing process, or he’s decided to shave his head and, actually, he looks quite sexy. They won’t necessarily see the same in a woman. They think: what’s happened to her?I’d like my hair to grow back, because it’s part of my identity, and I wouldn’t have to wear wigs any more. And nothing beats feeling the breeze through your hair. I miss that. People say: “It’s only hair!” and I’m like: really? I wish there was someone who said: “That must be hard. How do you feel about that? Is there anything you need?”From the age of 10, I had a small, fist-sized bald patch at the back of my head. I was quite self-conscious about being different, but my school allowed me to wear a baseball cap. I was picked on, but not a lot. I was probably lucky the friends I had weren’t bullies. They were quite encouraging. I put up with wearing a cap for a few years, but after a while, I just got fed up with it. My friends would say: “Oh, you’re not wearing your hat today,” but I didn’t think twice. I was confident in myself, even with a bald patch.When I hit 20, it all fell out within two weeks and stayed the same for eight years. At that age, I thought, what the heck, who cares? I’ll just shave it off. At least then, when I woke up in the morning, I wouldn’t find clumps of hair on my pillow. At first my scalp was quite pale but after a couple of weeks in the sun it evened out, so it just looked normal after that.But it does impact your life. Not having eyelashes, if you walk past a building site, dust gets in your eyes. My scalp is quite sensitive and if anything like a woolly hat touches it, it gets really itchy. So it gets cold in winter. I have tried dating apps and had no luck on that. People judge on appearances and it’s not until they meet me that they see that I am quite a lively sort of person.When I meet new people I say: “My name’s Ray, or you can call me the bald Chinese guy.” I think I am the only bald Chinese guy in Leicester. Rather than having people say that to me, I’m saying it first. I’m quite a relaxed, chilled person, and if you have questions about my baldness, don’t be afraid: ask.People do sometimes. Once, in the supermarket, the security guard asked, “How do you always get your head so smooth? What do you use?” which was quite funny. Alopecia has saved me money on haircuts, buying razor blades to shave my face, buying loads of shampoo. On that side, I think it is brilliant.People stare at me sometimes, but I don’t judge them for it. I don’t really care what they think. They don’t know the story. If they want to take the mick out of me, then that’s their problem. I feel comfortable with my own identity.Before this project I thought I was quite alone in this. Now I’ve found out that there is a community out there, I’d like to help other people with alopecia. If young kids can see adults with alopecia being secure about themselves, that will help them feel more comfortable with themselves, too.Additional reporting by Laura McDermott and Joanna York.• Alopecia UK, which supports people with hair loss, can be reached at alopecia.org.ukIf you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine’s letters page, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc7f9c0b01c63f1e47286cac7c04775cec54ac2a/204_454_2459_1475/master/2459.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=38ee3b25d9006ae921a3817a403a08ac","title":"kyle maclachlan this much i know twin peaks dale cooper david lynch showgirls","story":"The actor, 61, talks about Agent Cooper, working with David Lynch and how he got it wrong with ShowgirlsHaving a good mentor is important. I wasn’t particularly driven to be an actor. I’d tried lots of things out in college. I had a lot of interests acting was just one of them. I’m not sure I ever thought: “I could do this,” rather than: “I like doing this and I’d like to be able to do it.” But I was lucky to have really good people showing me the way. I’ve had a few help me, but meeting David Lynch had a monumental impact on me.Sometimes you have to accept you’re just not good enough. My dream – my fantasy – was to be a professional golfer. I spent so much time playing golf with my dad. Very early I realised that it just wasn’t going to happen. As soon as I started playing in tournaments against other people my age – and in some cases, younger – I realised I just couldn’t cut it. When I decided to go all in on acting, I didn’t really feel that.Dale Cooper is actually more David than me. There’s a lot of me in him and he’s absolutely my favourite character I’ve played. I’m a pretty positive person, I’m good natured, I take great pleasure in simple things or moments, whether that’s coffee or pie. But I added a lot of David’s traits in playing him, whether that was vocalisations or particular phrases David says. Really, Dale Cooper is David, not me.I try to do my best, always. What surprised me about Showgirls is I didn’t see it coming. Being in the middle of it, I saw some pretty powerful filmmaking. I thought the choreography was brilliant. We had some hugely talented people working on it. Then I saw the finished project and I’d really, really got it wrong. It taught me that you don’t know what a thing is going to be when you’re in the middle of something. All you can do is your best.I’ve learned so much about parenting from my parents. My parents cared more that me and my brothers were passionate about what we were doing than anything else. I’ve tried to adopt a similar approach with my children. I’m not the same kind of disciplinarian my father was I’m all about a conversation rather than anything like a king. But in other ways I’m hugely influenced by the two of them. I was very close to my parents. My mum died in 1986 and my dad went in 2011. I’d like to think I’ve inherited the same sense of kindness they both had.

Now it’s her mission – through her art and writing – to bring about changeFor artist and writer Charlotte Amelia Poe, 30, every day feels like a walk across a frozen pond. “It’s how it’s always been,” she explains. “You’re trying to navigate it and stay safe, but you’re aware that at any moment the ice is likely to crack, and at that point you will sink into the water.”The worst of it is that, when she feels that way, she has no idea how she can avoid going under. “You think you’re doing fine and you’re treading carefully enough not to crack the ice. But suddenly you’ve gone under. You’ve got it completely wrong – and you’ve no idea why.”Poe is describing how it feels to be autistic. She wants the rest of us to understand, she says, because it really matters, perhaps more than it’s ever mattered (of which more later). Her mission to break open the mystery of how it feels to be autistic has already been impressively successful: last year she won the Spectrum art prize for her video piece How To Be Autistic and recently she wrote a book of the same name. Her hope is that, by opening up about her own journey through childhood, school and adolescence, she can change other people’s perceptions and expectations about what autism is like, from the inside.We are talking in the sitting room of the semi-detached house overlooking a Suffolk field that Poe shares with three generations of her family. She has never left home and doesn’t expect to her nephews and niece are playing outside in the garden, and one day their mother, her sister, will be her carer in the way that her parents are at the moment.“It’s a scary feeling, that I’ll be inherited,” she says. “But I’d be very lonely if I had to live alone. I need people around me. I like noise and I like being surrounded by people I love.” She’s curled up on the sofa as we speak, her legs tucked underneath her, looking fragile and bird-like, but her voice is surprisingly strong, as well as impressively articulate.Poe was just six or seven years old and at primary school when she realised she was different. Astonishingly, it wasn’t until she was 21 that she received a diagnosis of autism. The reason, she says, is simple – society looks for autism in boys, not girls, and the way it presents means that boys are more likely to be identified with it. “Autistic children are often quiet and obedient when they’re very young – and if you’re a girl, that’s not unusual. But for a boy it is. If I’d been a boy I’d have been diagnosed years sooner.”That rankles, because at school she knew autistic boys and they had an easier time of it because they had a label – “Sometimes labels can be really helpful,” she says – and she describes how she was increasingly seen as awkward by her teachers, some of whom bullied her as much as some of her fellow pupils did.“If I’d been diagnosed sooner,” she says, “I wouldn’t have had the level of trauma I’ve had. It makes me angry that I have to deal with extra baggage that could have been avoided.”It was people’s attitude towards her, rather than the condition itself, that made life so unbearable. “Understanding is so important – that’s what makes a real difference,” she says. “We need trained people to support us, and there aren’t enough of them – and although there’s been more awareness of autism in the past few years, it’s not filtered through into proper training. My brother is a doctor and I think he spent one day on it in his entire time at medical school.”There are so many misunderstandings, she says. To take just one, autistic people are not unable to empathise. “It’s the weirdest thing, but people with autism get what others are feeling to a huge degree. It overwhelms us – that’s why we often don’t know how to respond, how to deal with it.”One focus of her difficulties, for several years, was her teeth. From the time they began to wobble she was unable to brush them. She’s not sure why she found the loss of her milk teeth so disturbing, but she speculates that it may have been because “autistic people are extremely sensitive to sensation, to change, to pain”. The net result: “I went through the entirety of first school and half of middle school with a mouth full of disgusting, stinking plaque.” Although her teeth are fine now, she tries not to show them when she’s talking or smiling.Having terrible teeth was one of the many things that made Poe stick out as different. She also had a tendency to vomit in public when her anxiety became too much to cope with (she ended up carrying a sick bowl around with her wherever she went, just in case). She was a picky eater and was unable to eat even a packed lunch at school – and she spent more and more time on her own in her bedroom.Academically she did well, although once homework got serious she found it increasingly difficult to tackle (“That’s called executive dysfunction – you know you should do something, but you can’t bring yourself to do it”) and that led to her being seen as difficult.Eventually, she started playing up to her profile. “You think, if I’m going to be seen as this, then it might help to just be it.” But as things would turn out, it was embracing her sense of “otherness” that led to a way forward, and gradually, being “different” became something she celebrated, rather than hid.She turned her attention to something she says is deeply ingrained in the autistic psyche – fandom. From Harry Potter to Captain America, she became a groupie, attending conventions and dressing up as her favourite characters. It felt like a liberation. “Fandom conventions are full of people with autism,” she says. “They’re somewhere we can be unashamedly who we are.” That’s because hyperfixation, she says, is both the best and the worst thing about being autistic. “You become very fixated on something – it’s very helpful when you’re working on a project, like writing a book for example, because you can write 20,000 words in a day. But it has very negative connotations for others – people who are over-enthusiastic about stuff are written off as “autistic” – and that devalues your opinion.”Today Poe looks as different as she feels. Her arms and legs are covered in tattoos and, on the day I meet her, her hair is dyed blonde with hues of light pink and pale blue. Being autistic still limits her life – agoraphobia means she only manages to leave the house once or twice a month, and she has to take tranquillisers first – but stumbling on the existence of the Spectrum art prize for people with autism, and then making the winning video, changed her life.She’d like to become a fiction writer, and is currently working on her first novel – but she’s also committed to telling it like it is about autism. And that matters because, she says, autistic people, once diagnosed and understood, have great potential – they’re often very effective iniduals who can make a noise and a difference. “We don’t have the same filter as neurotypical people and that can make us powerful and strong,” she says. “Look at the environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg, for example.”And there’s more, she says, because we live in a time when people who are “other” are increasingly dismissed, cut out of the action – and those with autism, who naturally identify as outsiders, can be effective champions for all outsiders. “We really get what it means to not fit in. And with the rise of populist politics and an insular society, at a time when the notion of ‘us versus them’ is increasingly common, people with autism have really important viewpoints and experiences to share.”Her most important point, though, is also her simplest. “If there’s one thing I’d like people to take away from my experience, that would help others with autism, it’s this: be kind,” she says. “Kindness is underrated. You don’t need to know their story, you just need to think about being friendly and helping, rather than deciding they’re strange or worthless and moving on fast. A little bit of kindness can make the world of a difference to someone who’s struggling.”How to be Autistic by Charlotte Amelia Poe  (Myriad Editions, £8.99) is available for £7.55 from bookshop"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab57f72199898d731920286907e98b5653deabd5/0_62_640_384/master/640.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ffd048daac4b6bfdd47b43c19a0d518","title":"how we stay together you cant just forge down your own path","story":"Paul and Lisa Thomson’s relationship has been a series of carefully negotiated compromises and sacrifices – each made to ensure the happiness of the wholeNames: Paul and Lisa Thomson Years together: 36Occupations: Singing coach and retired banking executiveThere’s a moment for many couples when their choice of partner is affirmed – or not.For Paul and Lisa Thomson, that moment came in the most frightening of situations: when their three-year-old son almost drowned. A fun day out at a family member’s home turned terrifying when little Nicholas was pulled from the pool. He’d been underwater for three minutes and it was touch and go.Paul remembers Lisa and him holding onto each other at the hospital for support. Then, when their son was out of intensive care, he watched as Lisa sat up all night watching over their child. “I thought, ‘This is the woman I’m glad I married because this is such a steady supporting love,’” he says. “I was very lucky to find someone who just showed so much courage and love.”The Sydney couple had been together for almost 20 years when that happened. They met in Brisbane in 1983 when they were in their 20s and contracted to sing in the Queensland Opera.In many ways, it was an easy match. “The music was there to bind us because we loved singing in the opera,” says Lisa. They performed together in Fidelio, Cavalleria Rusticana, Pagliacci and The Merry Widow. “When you’re in an opera company or a theatre company, you just have so much fun. Even rehearsals … because you really get to know one another.” And while they were in a competitive industry, there was no professional jealousy between them. “When you’re singing, you’ve got different voice types anyway, so it doesn’t matter,” says Lisa. “But for some of the relationships we knew that started right back there, those marriages haven’t lasted.”It wasn’t a difficult decision for Lisa. As much as she enjoyed music, she wasn’t prepared to sacrifice everything for it, and she was happy to work while Paul studied. “It was a big adventure to go to London ... I thought, ‘Oh well, I’m happy to go along for the ride.’ And I was happy to be with someone and look after them.”In London, the couple were young, in love and having a great time, travelling and exploring Europe. But it was lonely at times and money was tight – even though Lisa was working in all sorts of jobs. “I worked in a newsagent, I ran a carpet cleaning company, I sold Elna presses and sewing machines in John Lewis in Oxford Street.” Being far from home meant they relied on each other for friendship and support and drew them even closer together.After about five years in London, they returned home. “If we were going to have kids, we always wanted to come back to have them in Australia.” Still they wanted to put down their roots first, so they bought their first home and waited until they both had jobs before Lisa could take maternity leave.Although they both avoid confrontation, they’re good at compromise. “You both have to take one another’s needs and wants into consideration. You can’t just forge down your own path, my way or the highway. Not for our relationship, it doesn’t work like that for us,” says Lisa.And they’re very affectionate with each other, frequently saying ‘I love you’. “I come from quite an affectionate family, we’re very touchy,” says Paul “and Lisa doesn’t. But very quickly I realised that she yearned for the same thing … We show that affection without any problem. We kiss and we hug and we still do it.”The couple are going through another transition now that Lisa has retired. Having her at home all day was an adjustment for Paul. “I had a nice little sort of fiefdom at home here and I wasn’t too sure how it would work out,” he says with a laugh. “To Lisa’s credit, she’s formed a whole new lifestyle and routine being at home ... And I’ve seen her in a new light.”After all these years, they know each other well enough to understand what makes the other happy. “I know what Lisa needs and so I will choose to do that because I know if you want a successful relationship one can’t be happy, you both need to be happy,” says Paul.So for him, it means taking Lisa for a drive to the national park on a Sunday afternoon and getting an ice-cream together. “We’ll sit down with the chairs out at Bobbin Head for half an hour and we just watch the water. We enjoy nature, we enjoy the birds, we enjoy being outside.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a543db8d4824073ea095d7145459f8ae6e90fcf/85_322_4136_2482/master/4136.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f245e3f4e1174688c9a12b823494a565","title":"good sleep hygiene new wellness goal baby","story":"If anyone is worrying that they only got seven and a half hours’ sleep last night, allow me to put that into perspectiveThe most common signifiers of adulthood used to be getting a mortgage and gearing up for the midlife crisis. But who these days has the money for the former, or the time for the latter? Nowadays, the surest signs that you’ve reached maturity are an obsession with property magazines and a fascination with the quality of your sleep. Going by this criteria, I am more middle-aged than the most middle-aged sitcom dad ever (Darrin from Bewitched, who, Google informs me, was played by an actor five years younger than me when the show started. I am totally and definitely fine about this.)I am fascinated with sleep – but nowhere near as fascinated as everyone else, it seems. I can hardly walk down the street without someone telling me about their latest sleep app, or reading an article about “good sleep hygiene”, or hearing how sleep deprivation is the health equivalent of chaining 40 Benson \u0026amp Hedges a day, and of course how tired – so very, very tired – everyone is, because they didn’t get their requisite eight hours last night.How I laugh at this. I throw my head back and laugh the kind of full-throated cackle an evil genius makes right before he presses the red button that blows up the world. I have barely slept more than five hours a night since my daughter was born eight months ago, and there is something genuinely hilarious about this era of sleep obsession when you have a baby who refuses to let you sleep. It’s like living in a busted shack when everyone around you is banging on about the problems with their new basement extension. (I told you I was into property magazines.) “The truth about why you keep waking up at 3am” a doomy headline in this paper read recently. Is it because there’s a screaming baby in the cot next to your bed? “God, I’m so tired,” I used to say when I was young and merrily childfree. Talking about how tired I was back then seemed to be a way of proving how deeply sensitive I was (too fragile to sleep) while simultaneously giving the impression that I led an extremely exciting social life (too fabulous to sleep). But I did genuinely think I was tired, and this is what I want to say to my twentysomething self and any other young person who is about to say how tired they are: you’re not.So no, I don’t want to hear about how tired you are. But if you’re all having such trouble sleeping, how about if you take over the night shift with my baby? I’ll definitely sleep, and you and the baby can rave all night together. David Baddiel has said that the only thing that cured his insomnia was having kids, because they exhausted it out of him. Think of the money you could save on sleep apps, kids!Awake at 4am, I fantasise about a time when my kids are teenagers and sleeping until midday, which means I’ll sleep until midday, too. Or perhaps not: older parents warn me that, while child-induced sleeplessness cures insomnia, it also breaks you, leaving you doomed for ever after to wake at 6am. So maybe we’ve got this parenting thing all wrong: just as twentysomething bodies are supposed to cope best with pregnancy and childbirth, perhaps fifty- and sixtysomething biorhythms work best with a baby’s sleeping patterns. Older friends and relatives could rise at 6am and take the baby out for a nice walk around the park, while we broken thirty- and fortysomethings could be left to get on with other things. Like sleeping. Strangely, none have yet accepted my suggestion, but they’re probably just mulling it over.Last weekend I went away for a friend’s 40th, alone. We had dinner on the first night, and it was lovely, but I was impatient to get back to my hotel room where I knew the fun would really begin. Reader, I slept solidly for 11 hours. When I woke – naturally, as opposed to being woken – I nearly wept with happiness. The second night was a party and, giddy with freedom and an unaccustomed feeling of being well rested, I danced until the sky was light. The next day, I went home, and my husband, who had been looking after all three kids all weekend, asked how I was. I looked him right in the eyes and said, “God, I’m so tired.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab9d7508c01d4f7d3914a5bb93da539e10d17d11/0_46_3384_2030/master/3384.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4644d94576a5768d7b6e76981743c324","title":"frozen pensions australia","story":"Robert Haley served in the second world war but has lost thousands because he moved to AustraliaThere aren’t many people left alive on this planet who can, like London-born Robert Haley, talk about how he joined the Royal Navy at 17 in 1942 and saw almost four years’ active service during the second world war. He was one of thousands of seamen who risked their lives in the Arctic convoys to Russia between 1941 and 1945.Haley, now 94, earned a lapel full of medals – so why, say campaigners, has the UK government penalised him by freezing his state pension for almost 30 years? That has left him up to £4,200 out of pocket this year alone. All told, he has been deprived of as much as £62,000 since he turned 65 – money that could have transformed his retirement years.Haley has effectively been “punished” for moving to Australia, a Commonwealth nation, rather than one of the countries where your state pension increases in line with inflation.He is one of more than 500,000 Britons overseas losing out as a result of the UK’s “frozen pensions” policy. Their basic state pensions don’t increase every year, as in the UK – they are permanently frozen at the date the inidual retired or arrived in their country of residence.Last Monday was Commonwealth Day, and the press release talked about “delivering a common future”. But those words may feel hollow to some: the highest numbers of affected pensioners live in larger Commonwealth countries such as Australia and Canada.What has angered campaigners even more is that the government recently announced that, post-Brexit, it would continue to annually “uprate” UK state pensions for expats living across the EU, but it can’t or won’t find the money to boost the pensions of Britons living in the “frozen” countries.Haley was born in Ealing, west London, and spent four-and-a-half years in the Royal Navy between 1942 and 1946. As a result of his service, he has eight British medals and three Russian medals.But despite that, Haley receives a UK state pension that has been frozen at £46.90 per week. If he had stayed in the UK or moved to one of a list of other countries, he would be receiving a lot more than that. The full UK basic state pension is £129.20 a week, and will next month rise by £5.05 to £134.25.Haley, who lives in a retirement village in a suburb of Sydney, told  Money that it was “crazy” that the UK was able to get away with paying “paltry” sums to people like him. He, his wife and daughter (who is now 64) went to live in Australia in 1965. He does receive a monthly payment from the Australian Department of Veterans’ Affairs in recognition of his service in Australian waters. But while the department has a “gold card” for its Australian veterans, with most of their health and welfare covered fully, Haley is not entitled to this.Campaigners say cases like these highlight the unfairness of the UK policy. There are more than 100 countries worldwide where the UK basic state pension is not “uprated” each year. In addition to Australia and Canada, they include South Africa, New Zealand and India.If you move to one of them, your UK pension will be frozen at the date you retire, or when you arrived, no matter how rich or poor you are, what job you did, or how much national insurance you have paid.But if you move to an EU country, the US, or one of a seemingly random list of places such as Jamaica and Mauritius, your state pension increases in line with inflation.The policy has been in place for decades, and ministers have conceded the rules are “illogical”. However, they argue it would be too expensive to uprate those affected, and that the priority should be targeting money at the poorest pensioners at home.Ministers have previously estimated that to fully uprate everyone’s frozen pensions to current levels would cost more than £500m a year. However, campaigners say that so-called “partial uprating” would involve a much lower upfront cost: £37m.The all-party parliamentary group on frozen British pensions reformed last month and will be calling on the government to extend the promise made in the EU withdrawal agreement – that UK nationals living in Europe by 31 December 2020 will get their UK state pension uprated every year for as long as they continue to live there – to pensioners living in frozen countries.The Department for Work and Pensions has previously said that overseas recipients of the basic state pension will only get a yearly increase if they live in the European Economic Area (EEA), Gibraltar or Switzerland, or in a country with a reciprocal agreement with the UK that allows this to happen.Meanwhile, veterans impacted by this issue will be calling on minister for veterans’ affairs Johnny Mercer MP to support their call for action. The 95-year-old second world war veteran and campaigner Anne Puckridge, who lives in Canada, will also return to the UK this year to continue pressing their case.Find out more about the campaign at endfrozenpensions.org"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bec374219e2b72536806174e3607449ca78891bd/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61fa18fed659640cb075773654d8630b","title":"caroline polachek heaven live review dream voice pang","story":"Heaven, LondonBuoyed by universal praise for her solo debut album, the US pop prankster showcases her formidable songs and vocal cords with equal assuranceCaroline Polachek poses enigmatically against a backdrop projection of a wrought-iron gate that recalls some piece of misplaced Maleficent scenery. “This is the last show we might be at for a long time, so let’s make it a good one,” she grins, a couple of tracks into her set.Polachek’s show at London’s most famous railway arch – the club Heaven – reveals itself to be both a good one and a slight disappointment. This has little to do with Polachek’s own bravura performance – slick, clever, committed – and everything to do with some giddily raised expectations of the US pop auteur. Although she was previously in a band, Chairlift, whose song, Bruises, was ubiquitous in 2008 thanks to an iPod Nano ad, Polachek never became a household name.But a few years on from Chairlift’s 2016 demise, and a couple of projects into a solo career, Polachek now forms part of a recherché club of international art pop operatives who dance on the edge of mainstream fame. It’s not about the really big names – although the stars do line up to praise Polachek.Lady Gaga put the Connecticut-born singer’s So Hot You’re Hurting My Feelings on her recent International Women’s Day playlist. (Taylor Swift included the song Door.) Polachek’s song The Gate is on Grimes’s “fetal sync” pregnancy playlist too.More pertinently, Polachek’s solo album Pang exists in a delicious tension with Charli XCX’s Charli, also released in 2019. Both singers are also writers females who are conventionally strong pop vocalists, but want to do borderline avant garde things inside a notionally undemanding genre. And the personnel on both albums all know each other. You get the feeling that a plan is still unfolding.Charli was produced by AG Cook, previously of maverick London pop disrupters PC Music. Pang was produced by PCM alumnus Danny L Harle a house in Los Angeles used by both camps figured in the writing of the album. So Charli XCX’s verdict on Pang came as little surprise, but was not far off the mark: “top to tail perfection”, she called it.Even more germane, in the last fortnight, Polachek has been involved in other international grown-up pop happenings – as the featured guest on Christine and the Queens’ excellent recent EP, La Vita Nuova. In the short film that accompanied the CATQ release, Polachek becomes a victim to the red-eyed Héloïse Letissier’s vampiric desires.Days before tonight’s gig, Polachek joined Christine and the Queens on stage for a duet in a tiny east London club to mark the release. Not long before that, Polachek played her own deconstructed solo gig in a church for Radio 1 DJ Annie Mac’s AMP festival. Those stripped-back versions of Pang’s songs – on Chinese hammered dulcimer, electric upright bass and digital mellotron – were notable precisely because Pang was one of last year’s most hyper-produced pop offerings.All this notwithstanding, tonight’s gig proceeds by the book – and given all that has recently preceded it, that constitutes just the merest of let-downs. Letissier does not make a return special guest appearance. No one goes nuts on a hammered Chinese dulcimer. Nothing is stripped back in any conventional sense – apart from one song, Look at Me Now, which finds Polachek playing guitar alongside her sole bandmate, the multi-instrumentalist Blu DeTiger on bass, largely unaided by electronics. The crowd yell out one of the most personal lines – “girl, you’re getting skinny” – a concern in the song voiced by Polachek’s friends, as the singer processed the end of her four-year marriage and began anew. (Polachek sometimes models, but Pang serves as reassurance that even very beautiful people can be very articulate about being very sad.)The sole bit of lily-gilding tonight is a guest appearance by Harle, who joins Polachek in the encore to big cheers. On Parachute, a song about taking risks, he triggers the song’s digital atmospherics. Shortly afterwards, he ruins her concentration by triggering a loud hip-hop producer tag of “Caroline Polachek!”. One new pop song called Smoke – “we wrote this yesterday” – points enticingly forwards, as Polachek, Harle and the bassist on backing vocals trade beats with “na, na, nas”.The rest of the night remains all about Pang’s suite of sad, arty alt-bangers in all their original synthetic glory: reverberating bass, snickety hi-hats, mostly ersatz, all delicious. She plays nothing from her Chairlift days, or from her other previous projects, Ramona Lisa and CEP. But the DJ’s pre-gig playlist of wall-to-wall Cocteau Twins points up the sophisticated nature of what is actually going on in Polachek’s music, which still bears examination.Not only that, but the songs sound as strong as you remember them. Even The Gate, which seemed initially as an introductory passage, sounds profound tonight. “We will be OKCos finally there’s a way to be both free and safe,” Polachek exhales."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbe62def096eeb6e88bdbc269e78ba3908410c30/0_70_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c6f303185a82d41f4283881e3556c20","title":"one to watch brooke bentham everyday nothing sam fender newcastle","story":"The River Tyne has seen many singer-songwriters bubbling up from its banks. After Sting and Neil Tennant, Richard Dawson and Sam Fender comes 24-year-old Brooke Bentham, who used to play buskers nights with Fender in Newcastle before his career went stratospheric. Her lovely, sleepy sound recalls the US indie-rock of the 1990s, made for late-night drives, alone, listening to the car radio.Bentham started releasing singles while studying at London’s Goldsmiths University. She got into Yo La Tengo and Mazzy Star, whose woozy atmospheres linger around her 2017 EPs The Room Swayed and This Rapture. Not long after, she met Bill Ryder-Jones, who now plays in her band, produced her recently released debut album, and has described her lyrical talents as being up there with those of Alex Turner and the Coral’s James Skelly.Bentham’s album, Everyday Nothing, is about the tensions and extremes of young adulthoodas its title suggests, its sound bed one of reverb-laden drums and guitars. The best tracks include Blue Light, whose chorus wouldn’t feel out of place if done by Crowded House, and the propulsive, grungy Control, about being ghosted (its brilliant video shows with black humour the dead weight of missing someone, an unseeing Bentham pouring milk into a glass until it overflows). Elsewhere, doo-wop and the fuzzier edges of Pavement and REM linger gorgeously.

Meanwhile, the start of the Indian Premier League has been delayed from 29 March to 15 April, while Cricket West Indies have put all regional tournaments on hold from 16 March.The remaining two matches of India’s home one day international series against South Africa have now been postponed. Having originally been moved behind closed doors, Australia and New Zealand’s ODI series has now also been postponed, as well as the three-match Twenty20 series. Both sides are working on finding alternative dates to rearrange the fixtures. Australia won the first ODI on Friday but the visitors have now returned to New Zealand after a change to travel restrictions there. Black Caps bowler Lockie Ferguson was briefly isolated in the team hotel, but has since been cleared to return home.The Paris-Nice race that was due to finish on Sunday looked set to be cancelled after the French Cycling Federation (FFC) announced the cancellation of all cycling events on French soil due to the Covid-19 epidemic. The Giro d’Italia, which was due to begin in Hungary in May, has also been postponed, while the Six Day Manchester that was due to be held this weekend will not take place. The UK-based Women’s Tour and Tour Series have both been postponed. Race organisers will now attempt to work with the UCI and British Cycling to find an alternative date for the Women’s WorldTour event, which was originally set to take place between 8-13 June.All elite football in Britain has been suspended until at least 3 April, with every game in England’s Premier League, EFL, FA Women’s Super League and Women’s Championship now postponed. The National League has, however, decided to allow matches in its three isions to proceed as planned this weekend citing guidance from the Football Association which “made it clear the decision to continue or to suspend a competition is a matter for each league to make” but York City and Altrincham have taken the joint decision to postpone their match. Scotland has also suspended domestic professional and grassroots football until further notice.Uefa has postponed all continental tournaments, including all of next week’s Champions League and Europa League fixtures. European football’s governing body will meet stakeholders including representatives of its 55 member associations on Tuesday, with the prospect of Euro 2020 being delayed for a year among the options being considered.France and Germany have now followed Italy, Portugal, Spain and the majority of domestic European leagues in postponing fixtures until at least the start of April.Most countries who have reported cases of the coronaries have taken steps to postpone their domestic programmes, while Fifa has also put this month’s 2022 World Cup qualifiers in Asia on hold and advised that advised that all remaining international matches due to be played in March and April should be postponed indefinitely. But with China having reported a marked decrease in new Covid-19 patients over the last few days, Chinese Super League side Wuhan Zall are set to return home having been stranded in Spain since the end of January.For the first time since 1945, the Masters will not take place in the second week of April after Augusta National postponed golf’s first major of the year on Friday. “We hope this puts us in the best position to safely host the Masters Tournament and our amateur events at some later date,” said chairman Fred Ridley. The decision followed the abandonment of the Players Championship at Sawgrass during the first round on Thursday, while the PGA Tour has also cancelled the Valero Texas Open. The ANA Inspiration – the first ladies’ major of the year – was also postponed on Friday.After the Cheltenham Festival came to an end on Friday, there are currently no plans to restrict any meetings next week apart from at Kelso on Monday, which will be held behind closed doors under advice from the Scottish government. “We are aware of the decisions taken by a number of sports today to suspend fixtures in advance of any government decision coming into effect,” said the BHA. “Racing’s leaders are monitoring the situation daily and are currently considering a range of options in this rapidly developing situation. Contingency plans are ready as required.”After the Australian Grand Prix was dramatically postponed on Thursday night, the FIA quickly confirmed that the Bahrain and Vietnam Grands Prix will now not take place on their scheduled dates. “As a result, Formula 1 and the FIA expect to begin the Championship in Europe at the end of May but given the sharp increase in Covid-19 cases in Europe in recent days, this will be regularly reviewed,” said Formula 1’s governing body in a statement. The Dutch Grand Prix on 3 May and the Spanish Grand Prix a week later are also in doubt. Meanwhile, Formula E has suspended its season until May which means races in Paris, Seoul and Jakarta will be affected.The ATP Tour suspended all events for six weeks on Thursday and the WTA has also confirmed that there will be no tournaments for five weeks. “This is not a decision that was taken lightly,” said the ATP chairman Andrea Gaudenzi.Leeds Rhinos have postponed their Super League game against Catalans Dragons on Saturday that had been due to take place in France behind closed doors after one of their players showed symptoms of the virus. But the rest of this weekend’s fixtures are still set to take place, as well as several fifth-round Challenge Cup ties. The government’s upcoming ban on mass public gatherings means next weekend’s fixtures will almost certainly be postponed.The Six Nations match between Wales and Scotland in Cardiff was called off 24 hours before kick off, following the earlier postponement of the final round’s other two matches: Italy v England and Ireland v France. “Given the fluid and unprecedented nature of this issue, a postponement became the only viable option,” said the WRU in a statement.All of Sunday’s Women’s Six Nations fixtures are also cancelled, while the Pro14 competition and all French rugby union have been halted. Sunday’s Premiership Rugby Cup final between Sale and Harlequins was called off on Friday. The WRU has also put all forms of rugby on hold in Wales, including training and courses.World Triathlon has announced the suspension of all races and activities until the end of April, immediately after the Mooloolaba World Cup in Australia was completed.The event at London’s O2 next weekend is still set to go ahead, although this weekend’s event in Brasilia will take place behind closed doors.The Boston Marathon has been moved to September, following the suspension of several other sports in the US, including Major League Soccer, the National Hockey League, Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association and the XFL.

Schachmann, who collapsed in exhaustion after the finish line, had led the week-long race from start to finish after securing an impressive victory on the first stage in Plaisir.Thomas de Gendt (Lotto Soudal) had earlier launched a trademark solo bid for final-stage glory after a breakaway group that featured some big hitters such as Romain Bardet (AG2R-La Mondiale), Alberto Bettiol (EF Pro Cycling) and Quintana (Arkea Samsic) was whittled down to just two: De Gendt and Julian Alaphilippe (Deceuninck-Quick-Step).De Gendt dropped his French rival inside the final 15km as he went for broke but was then reeled in by Quintana’s powerful attack which came less than five kilometres from the finish on the long final climb. Quintana passed the breakaway specialist De Gendt and won the stage by 47 seconds with Pinot coming home third, 56 seconds back.Schachmann said: “It was very, very hard. The last three kilometers were a walk through hell, through pain. Now it’s like being in heaven and it erases all the pain in my legs.“It’s not my first success but the biggest so far and the most important because a whole lot of people doubted that I could be a GC rider,” Schachmann said. “Now I won the most prestigious one-week race.”As top-level sports were postponed across the globe on Friday, race organisers had announced their decision to scrap the final stage but conclude the race with no fans permitted at the start and finish areas.That decision followed the French government’s move to ban gatherings of more than 100 people in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Several high-profile teams such as Team Ineos, Mitchelton-SCOTT and Astana Pro Team had withdrawn before the race began.Along with every other sport, the future of the professional cycling season is clouded in uncertainty. The Giro d’Italia has already been postponed, along with a number of the Spring classics including E3 Harelbeke and Gent-Wevelgem. The Tour of Flanders, one of the biggest one-day races on the calendar, is scheduled for 5 April and, as things stand, could in theory go ahead, with all professional sport in Belgium called off until only 31 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86ed2cb65d0316767acba83424bbf21852a64667/287_372_3638_2183/master/3638.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80d49d58a25b028892c2336e90956a4f","title":"sport coronavirus empty schedules football","story":"Fans across the United Kingdom and much of the rest of the world experienced the eerie sensation of a Saturday without sport. With professional football called off across the country, Six Nations and Premiership rugby union suspended, England’s cricket tour of Sri Lanka abandoned and this weekend’s Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne also called off, it was left to horse racing, non-league football and an Olympic boxing qualifier to fill the British calendar.But while supporters sought to entertain themselves in new ways, debate continued inside sport as to what direction to take in the face of a pandemic that could yet last for months. First and foremost on the list of concerns is the Olympic Games. With football’s Euro 2020 expected to be postponed for a year at a meeting scheduled for Tuesday, the biggest event of all is the last one standing.This past week the Olympic torch relay was aborted in Greece and the US president, Donald Trump, said the Games – due to take place in Tokyo in July – should be moved back a year. But on Saturday the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, stepped in to insist the event was still on track. “We will overcome the spread of the infection and host the Olympics without problem, as planned,” Abe said, adding that the topic of postponement was “not a subject at all” during a recent call with Trump.Abe also said Japan was working closely with the International Olympic Committee, which will have the final say on whether the Games go ahead, and the World Health Organization, suggesting he accepted that the ultimate decision did not rest with Tokyo. The Japanese leg of the torch relay is due to begin on 26 March.After the Premier League and EFL together decided on Friday to suspend play until at least the first weekend in April, in football the discussion has since moved on to the possibility of the league season being cancelled altogether. It is understood the Premier League is considering a number of options ahead of an emergency meeting next Thursday. These range from trying to complete the season behind closed doors in a “sanitised” environment to declaring this season void and promoting the top two teams from the Championship, Leeds and West Brom, to play in an expanded 22-team competition next season.One club executive, West Ham’s Karren Brady, used her column in Saturday’s Sun to call for the season to be voided if it cannot quickly be resumed. Brady wrote: “The Premier League hopes that an interlude of three weeks from now will enable it to restart but that may well be dreamland. Perhaps scrubbing Euro 2020 could provide more time to complete the season into the summer but that is also a giant ‘if’. What if the league cannot be finished?“As games in both the Premier League and in the EFL are affected, the only fair and reasonable thing to do is declare the whole season null and void. Who knows who would have gone down or come up if the games have not actually been played in full?”Voiding the league season would carry substantial financial implications and, while most Premier League clubs would be able to take the hit, that is not the case for clubs lower down the pyramid who are much more reliant on gate receipts to keep running.Steve Thompson, managing director of Dagenham and Redbridge who play in the National League, said the outlook was bleak for smaller clubs. “Potentially some are not going to survive this,” Thompson said. “We’ve got a large social facility with two function rooms, and lots of clubs in non‑league and Leagues One and Two rely on that income.”For supporters, meanwhile, there was the relatively less stressful challenge of trying to fill their empty time. Many fans sought out their nearest amateur match, while others spent more time on social media, sharing old moments or imagining new ones. Southampton came up with one alternative to playing their Premier League match against Norwich: challenging the Canaries to a game of noughts and crosses on Twitter.Norwich failed to take up the offer – perhaps being away from their phone during what would have been half-time had the match been played – and so Manchester City stepped in. The game was played to a scoring draw."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f51c2d2645c1cf7361149af1940fe1cda58a8426/0_162_5105_3064/master/5105.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a866ef1c84e243cb9ce111237bfae1c8","title":"cheltenham festival 2020 in pictures","story":"Our photographer Tom Jenkins captures the winners, the losers, the punters and all the thrills and spills at this year’s Cheltenham Festival"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eef81e670ca3f51b686a70102c21eb602d0347bb/0_115_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b35ae005aeaa171f6489062741c95923","title":"facebook uncovers russian led troll network based in west africa","story":"Fake Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts seemed to aim to inflame ides in USA newly discovered Russian-led network of professional trolls was being outsourced to Ghanaian and Nigerian operatives, according to Facebook and Twitter, who removed the network’s accounts on Thursday.The network was small: just 49 Facebook accounts, 85 Instagram accounts and 71 Twitter accounts in question. But it marks the first time that a Russian information operation targeting the US has been found to be run from Africa.Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook’s head of security policy, said the company believes it was such a small network because it was disrupted in the early stages of building its audience. It was, Gleicher said, “operated by local nationals – some wittingly and some unwittingly – in Ghana and Nigeria on behalf of iniduals in Russia.“The people behind this network engaged in a number of deceptive tactics, including the use of fake accounts … to manage pages posing as non-government organisations or personal blogs, and post in groups,” Gleicher added.“They frequently posted about US news and attempted to grow their audience by focusing on topics like black history, black excellence and fashion, celebrity gossip, news and events related to famous Americans like historical figures and celebrities, and LGBTQ issues. They also shared content about oppression and injustice, including police brutality.”Although the Facebook network posted a significant amount of content, it steered clear of explicitly political postings. Instead, the desire seems to have been to post content that would grow the audience, while also inflaming contemporary American ides.“Although the people behind this activity attempted to conceal their purpose and coordination, our investigation found links to EBLA, an NGO in Ghana, and iniduals associated with past activity by the Russian Internet Research Agency (IRA),” Gleicher said.The Twitter accounts shared many similar traits. But an archive of the messages posted by the fake accounts, shared by Twitter, offers extra insight into how Russian information actors are exploiting the coronavirus pandemic for their own ends.Hundreds of messages in the archive, which covers late January and early February, mention the pandemic, mostly in replies to influential accounts and iniduals.One, bizarrely, warns British reality TV star and 1980s computer magnate Alan Sugar to “be careful” of the coronavirus. Another shares the news that “health officials fear that misinformation about the virus could spark a run on medications”. But most of the tweets simply reflect an urge to jump on popular topics to gain more followers, a reflection of how early the network was discovered.“These 71 removed accounts, operating out of Ghana and Nigeria and which we can reliably associate with Russia, attempted to sow discord by engaging in conversations about social issues, like race and civil rights,” said Twitter’s safety team in a statement.During the cold war, the KGB sought to exploit smouldering racial isions in the US with a series of “active measures”. According to Oleg Kalugin, Moscow’s former spy chief in America, the KGB carried out a series of dirty tricks.These included writing anonymous racist hate letters to African diplomats in New York, purporting to come from American white supremacists. Kalugin and his fellow KGB officers, posing as journalists, published these letters, quoting them as examples of rampant American racism.Kalugin said he “lost no sleep” over such tactics, “figuring they were just another weapon in the cold war”. The KGB also planted stories in US publications saying Washington sided with the racist regime in South Africa, he said.The Soviet Union may be long gone but Moscow’s strategic thinking remains largely unchanged. There is compelling evidence that the Kremlin has sought to reboot KGB methods of propaganda and disinformation via anonymous posts on social media.According to the US special counsel Robert Mueller, in 2016 trolls working out of the notorious factory in St Petersburg made contact with a number of American black activists.The Russians posed as a grassroots group, Black Matters US. In February 2017, a Russian troll using the persona Black Fist even hired a self-defence instructor in New York to give classes to black Americans, Mueller reported.Leaked documents reported on by the  last year showed that Russia was engaged in a renewed push for influence in Africa."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a99f6b74d2bf40ba13ae5290971f818444d0d6c2/0_416_5013_3008/master/5013.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d77adfe6c93ed8f9896d5fd44ce1bf2c","title":"readers tips sawdays spring favourite places uk","story":"Grand houses and gardens, woods, villages, parks and gardens, museums and galleries … share your favourite springtime UK outingIt could be a National Trust property or an area of protected countryside vibrant with wildflowers and birdsong, a village that comes to life in spring, a gallery or museum opening up after the winter.

That sets up an ongoing bruising battle between the two candidates for the immediate future even as the vast majority of observers believe Sanders will eventually have to grit his teeth and fall in line behind Biden.No major 2020 Democratic candidate, current or former, has told supporters not to back the eventual Democratic nominee. Likewise, no serious Democratic surrogate has urged supporters to sit out if their candidate doesn’t win. It is a precedent made even more urgent given Democrats’ anger at Trump and fears over him winning a second term.But the fierce fight between the progressive and centrist wings of the party has had an impact as the party begins to look ahead to the November battle.Saikat Chakrabarti, the former chief of staff to the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the president of the New Consensus network, said the worry is not getting progressives to vote for a nominee they may not have backed in the primary. Chakrabarti said it was rallying voters who stayed out of the general election in 2016.“The thing I’m worried about is if Joe Biden wins the nomination, what will he do to get actual voters,” said Chakrabarti, “the kinds of folks who stayed home in 2016, and I mean disaffected African American voters, working class voters, people who are really having a tough time with the current economy.”As the primary has shifted essentially to a two-man race, the rivalry between Biden and Sanders and their respective supporters has intensified. Interviews with over more than a dozen Democratic strategists and officials yields a sense of confidence that all the participants in the primary will shift their focus to defeating Donald trump in the general election.But these Democrats also caution that to erase hard feelings left over from the primary, the Democratic nominee will have to extend some kind of olive branch to the runner up and his supporters.Biden will have to work hard to win over disappointed grassroots progressives if he wins as expected. In the now highly unlikely event Sanders wins, he will have to ease concerns from wary Democratic moderates.“I think there has to be a set of actions,” said Steve Grossman, a former Democratic National Committee chairman. “I think there has to be a consistent expression of respect for the progressive wing of the Democratic party that is palpable and meaningful and smart and savvy and thoughtful.”In recent days Biden and his top aides have said urged Sanders supporters to come support their campaign. Similarly on Thursday, Jeff Weaver, a senior Sanders adviser, said the Vermont senator would support Biden if the former vice-president got the nomination. Weaver said Sanders would “absolutely” bring his supporters into the fold even if he didn’t get the nomination.“If Joe Biden is the nominee Bernie Sanders will support him wholeheartedly, we’ll campaign for him,” Weaver said.During Biden’s election night speech on Tuesday he thanked Sanders and his supporters “for their tireless energy and their passion”.“We share a common goal and together we’ll defeat Donald Trump,” Biden said. “We’ll defeat him together. We’re going to bring this nation together.”But for now, with the contest still live and heading for a debate in Arizona on Sunday, Sanders and his supporters are showing no sign of falling in line behind Biden. Progressive Sanders supporters still see a narrow path to the nomination , even as Biden’s delegate lead becomes insurmountable. For them, simply defeating Trump isn’t enough.Jennifer Epps-Addison, network president of the Center for Popular Democracy, which endorsed Sanders, said Democrats cannot rely on antipathy to Trump to turnout young people and progressive activists inspired by Sanders campaign in November.“If they want our time, our energy and our organizing efforts, then they’re going to have to agree to actually include us in the leadership and the governance of the party,” said Epps-Addison.She added that if Biden is the nominee it will matter who he chooses to be his running mate, warning against anyone with a problematic record on criminal justice.“We are very concerned that Donald Trump right now is poised to run to the left of Joe Biden on criminal justice reform,” Epps-Addison said. “It is a terrifying prospect for those of us who are knocking doors in black and brown communities that have been terrorized by the crime bill that Joe Biden was the architect of.”In a scenario where Biden wins the nomination, he will have to consider embracing some of the issues Sanders campaigned on, said Jared Leopold, a veteran Democratic operative.“I think a lot of it is going to be about leaning into the issues that they care about,” Leopold said. “That doesn’t mean that Joe Biden needs to fundamentally change who he is, but I think talking about issues that young people care about and progressives care about will be important to mobilizing those voters in the fall.”Mark Longabaugh, a senior adviser to Sanders’ 2016 campaign, said that “any kind of marriage is a two way street”.“Biden, if he is the nominee, would be wise to reach out and make an effort to make Sanders and his supporters feel welcome in a Biden coalition,” Longabaugh said.And right now, Sanders has a better chance of exerting influence over the main committees at the Democratic national convention in July than winning the nomination.“The more delegates you have clearly the more leverage you have,” Longabaugh said. “And he has plenty of delegates.”He added: “And my own view is that if Bernie Sanders does not have a good night next Tuesday, he needs to seriously think about getting out and rallying around the Joe Biden candidacy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce84eaa859330a610546421ff840c59fa0562c73/0_201_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5ae4aefa3f21d5dd127d0d565ea5b52","title":"new york city coronavirus impact","story":"The city isn’t a ghost town – yet – but small businesses are hurting for customers as polite pedestrians avoid physical contactRunning through Manhattan from the Battery to the Bronx, Broadway is New York City’s lifeline. So in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak – and the raft of restrictive measures being implemented across the city and the state in an attempt to contain it – it seems like a good place to check the prevailing mood.It doesn’t bode well when, on the 4 train down to Wall Street, a busker with a guitar performs a song featuring the words “coronavirus everywhere you turn”. Other than that, and the presence of a few face masks and latex gloves, everything appears relatively normal.Above ground, it’s grey and mild. While it’s not heaving, New York is definitely not a ghost town. There are people milling around and tourists lining up as usual to take selfies with the Charging Bull, the bronze sculpture which sums up the spirit of nearby Wall Street.The first person I encounter is Tim Lamch, 38, who with a huge bag on his back and pushing a fully loaded drinks trolley, makes a surreal sight. Is this coronavirus related?“I just happen to be moving during coronavirus,” he says. “I’m only moving two blocks.”The account executive, currently working from home because of the virus, says it’s busier than he had anticipated.“People need to be out. People don’t want to be cooped up and people still have to work. Not everyone can work from home.”At the bull, tourist Liliana Oropeza, 44, is lining up with her husband and 10-year-old son. The family, from Monterrey, Mexico, are trying to make the best of the situation but so far, she says, their holiday has been “awful”.“We bought tickets and can’t use them because the museums are closed. We are trying to move our flight home to maybe Monday.”On the streets, people are more polite than usual – apologising if they bump into each other, avoiding physical contact.A steady trickle of people are coming out of the New York Stock Exchange, to go get their lunch. But as I make my way uptown, coronavirus’s impact on small businesses becomes clear.Ramirez adds: “I’m worried because I have to work. I need to take care of many people.”Further up, there’s a line of food trucks. It’s 12.30pm but none have more than one customer. Sayed Sadat, 52, who works at a bagel and lunch truck, is packing away after a deathly quiet morning. A huge bin of uneaten bagels stands next to the truck.Disaster also looms for the souvenir sellers. On a corner near Fulton Street, where shoals of tourists usually pass on the way to the Brooklyn Bridge, Tiger Diop, wearing a feathered “happy new year” headband, sits, his merchandise unbought.“I don’t know how I’m going to make a living,” he says. “Everybody’s suffering now.”By city hall, a small group of climate protesters stand with a big “Fridays for Future” flag. The street is so quiet that birdsong is audible from the gardens.As I reach the Tribeca neighbourhood, the sun comes out. It seems to bring more pedestrians. But John, 55, a souvenir seller dressed in a white surgical mask and a New York police department cap, says the street is considerably quieter than usual. He has started selling latex gloves and alcohol disinfectant but he says it’s hand sanitizer people want – a commodity impossible to track down. A nearby convenience store has a sign in the window: “Masks sold here.”In Soho, Steff Bradley, 23, a graphic designer, and student Wilson Chiu, 25, are on their way to the bank. Bradley is wearing a mask. She says she felt short of breath this morning and is so anxious about coronavirus that she “had a panic attack over a runny nose”. As we speak, she reprimands Chiu, who says he is not concerned about the virus, for touching his face.Near New York University, which recently moved all classes online, I speak to a group of computer science students who agree the area has “definitely got a different vibe”.In Washington Square it becomes clear that just about everybody is talking about one thing: coronavirus. Disrupted travel arrangements, whether or not to go to a party, cleaning techniques, how much food they’ve got stocked up.In Union Square, everything seems reassuringly normal – people are playing chess at tables, there’s music, the farmers’ market is on. But things take an apocalyptic turn when I spot a man in a full respirator mask and eye shield inspecting potatoes at a vegetable stand. The man, who doesn’t want to be named, says he is in his 70s and on medication and fears for his health.“These are not normal times,” he says, in muffled tones.At Madison Square Park it looks like everybody working from home has taken the opportunity to take their pet to the dog area and enjoy the sun. But the atmosphere is distinctly lacking in Friday buzz.At Times Square I’m greeted by Elmo, Lady Liberty and Spiderman. Unusually, they don’t seem to be able to entice anybody near them. Finally, a man walking into Walgreens agrees, elbow bumping Lady Liberty as Elmo takes a photo, before ambling back in to do his shopping. A solitary man dances to the soundtrack of his AirPods.On the steps, usually packed with tourists, there is plenty of breathing room. British tourists, Dan Hase, 33, and Claire Hase, 30, from Newcastle, are visiting New York for the first time. They are understandably disappointed. After arriving on Wednesday night, they went to see The Lion King only to find all Broadway performances had been cancelled and many of the attractions on the three-day pass they bought are closed.“It was a bit of a letdown,” says Dan.It is at West 44th street, where lots of theatres – including St James’s, currently home to the Frozen musical, and the Shubert, showing To Kill A Mockingbird – that I find the most haunting scene of the day.The road is usually full of people queuing to get in, gathering during intervals, taxis dropping people off, red ropes for premieres. Now, it is almost completely empty.A few people are in the box offices, optimistically booking tickets for brighter times. But on the street it’s so quiet that all I can hear is a plastic food container – New York tumbleweed – blowing down the street."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/559c4e2fefa1438f4f034fb20ea2e312c4d5c14e/0_61_1666_1000/master/1666.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5dd1544140e5ff3512ed75e4205e66c2","title":"tell us your experiences testing for the coronavirus","story":"If you work for Public Health England (PHE) or NHS 111 we want to hear from youTo ease the strain on Public Health England, NHS hospital laboratories will test swab samples from people who display symptoms of coronavirus﻿.We want to hear from people working for PHE and NHS 111 about their experiences of testing people for coronavirus.

We will get through this together,” said the prime minister, who has been in self-isolation after his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday.Officials announced a raft of new measures including closing parliament for five weeks and redirecting incoming international flights to a small number of airports as part of enhanced screening measures. The government also announced it will ban cruise ships with 500 people from docking in the country’s ports until 1 July – but stopped short of closing the borders.“Borders don’t stop travellers. Travellers find other ways into countries. Travellers become less honest,” said Patty Hajdu, the county’s health minister. “Canada’s approach from the very beginning has been to use science and evidence.”Instead, the government has asked Canadians to avoid non-essential travel outside the country and to limit contact with crowds.“Social distancing is an important contribution that everyone can make to our control efforts,” said Theresa Tam, the country’s chief public health officer. “This means avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings, considering shopping or taking public transport in off-peak hours and greeting one another with a wave or elbow instead of a handshake, kiss or hug.”So far, Canada has conducted more than 15,000 tests and has 157 confirmed cases of the virus, most of which have been found in the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia, she said.Despite the relatively low number of cases, the federal government and provinces have acted swiftly in recent days.British Columbia, Alberta and Quebec have all banned events larger than 250 people. Ontario, the country’s most populous province, will close schools for two additional weeks following spring break, as will Quebec.Late on Friday, officials in Toronto, the country’s largest city, announced the closure of all child care facilities, public libraries and community centres. They also announced the surprise cancellation of all spring break camps and urged residents to reconsider taking public transit.“The actions you take today will save lives,” Hajdu said. “This is a serious public health threat, and a crisis as well as an emergency.”Experts cautioned that no clear blueprints yet exist on now to stem the spread of the virus — but said that certain measures have shown degrees of success.“There’s no complete science behind any of it really — but it’s worthwhile to explore different ways of trying to control things,” said infectious disease specialist Dr. Susy Hota, medical director of prevention and control at Toronto’s university health network. “That’s where the social distancing makes sense to consider doing it early and trying to reduce the overall impact on everybody.”As the country prepares for an economic slowdown, driven by both the coronavirus and a plunge in oil prices, Trudeau said his government plans to green-light a wide-scale economic stimulus plan in the coming days.“We are in the enviable position of having significant fiscal firepower available,” he said.“We need to design policies that will really help liquidity and cashflow for businesses that are uniquely affected right now,” he said on Thursday.The prime minister has not yet put a figure on the stimulus plan, but said the action will target Canadians who are most vulnerable to a downturn.“No one should have to worry about paying rent, buying groceries, or additional childcare because of Covid-19. We will help Canadians financially.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/137efcc867cccbca2da827e7fef8919b589ccc42/0_98_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=141f2ce0964569f885bbaa5bc894eb00","title":"palermo pins hopes patron saint rosalia rid italy coronavirus","story":"Residents of Sicilian capital pray for another miracle from Saint Rosalia, who they say rescued the city from a deadly plague in 1625Legend has it that in 1625, as a plague swept Palermo and killed dozens of people each day, Saint Rosalia appeared before a man.Rosalia, a young Sicilian hermit who died 500 years earlier, told him that if the people of Palermo walked in procession while carrying her relics, to be found in a grotto on Monte Pellegrino, then the “evil fever” would disappear.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.After months of debate over the authenticity of that apparition, Saint Rosalia’s remains – among them a piece of her jaw and three fingers – were paraded through the city at an event attended by thousands of devotees. When the plague began to ebb, she was proclaimed the holy protector of the city.Four hundred years later, the prayers that Palermitans offer to Saint Rosalia travel in chain messages on WhatsApp. They are asking her for another miracle: free the city of coronavirus, which has killed more than 1,000 people in Italy.The country has been under a government-imposed lockdown to contain the outbreak. Since then, the streets of Palermo have been desertedt. It is a surreal scene in one of the noisiest cities in southern Italy.So far, the virus has infected about 111 people in Sicily, a relatively small number compared with the rest of the country, but enough to scare people.Sicilians are well aware of Lombardy’s wealth, where the outbreak has killed 500 people. If Covid-19 spreads with the same intensity in a disadvantaged region such as Sicily, the consequences for the population could be catastrophic.The last emergency in Palermo was in 1992, when the city was invaded by thousands of soldiers. The enemy then, the mafia, had claimed more victims than coronavirus.The bosses of Cosa Nostra waged war on the state, killing police officers, judges and journalists. In response, the government dispatched 5,000 military personnel to contain what, by that point, had become an all-out offensive against the Italian state.“I’ll never forget those days,” says Leoluca Orlando. “But it was also the beginning of a revolution that brought this city to raise its head against the mafia. It took years before we managed to weaken the power of Cosa Nostra in our city.“We didn’t resolve the mafia scourge in four days, just as we won’t overcome coronavirus in a week. Winning battles requires patience and determination.”Shortly after the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, announced a nationwide lockdown, hundreds of Palermo’s citizens besieged the few supermarkets that were open late to stock up on food and water.“I’ve been at home in voluntary isolation for days. From here, thanks to smart working, we hold the city council meetings online to cope with the emergency. In 24 hours we translated into 18 languages the new guidelines to avoid transmission of the virus.”Last year, Orlando defied the far-right former interior minister Matteo Salvini, who closed all the ports to rescue boats trying to save migrants.“I recently read a poem on coronavirus. It said that if we all make it through, at the end of this tragedy we’ll be better people. At this time, the world views Italians as plague-stricken. I hope someone has learned a lesson. I hope people realise what it means to be discriminated against. I hope they understand how it feels to have the doors slammed, just as we did with migrants.”Experts predict the economic impact of coronavirus in Sicily could be devastating. In a region where the strongest sector of the economy is tourism, the fear that people will not visit this summer is taking hold.“The price we’ll pay for this epidemic will be high,” says Milani, an LGBT activist and coordinator of the Palermo Pride festival. Enjoying the sun in her chair outside her famous leather-goods shop in Palermo, she takes in the eerie silence on streets normally teeming with tourists and shoppers. Even before Conte ordered retailers to close, few shopkeepers in Palermo were opening their doors for business.“What worries me most isn’t the economy but the human cost. This epidemic will have a lasting effect on interpersonal relations, which were already compromised before coronavirus. Before the outbreak, people spent less time together. Now we keep a distance from each other for health reasons. When will it end?“This situation will leave a mark on everyone’s soul. I’m thinking about those neighbourhoods in Palermo that thrive on human relations. Of course, we must be vigilant because some people will try to get rich from the emergency as well.”In the historic open-air market of Ballarò, the most noisy and colourful neighbourhood in Palermo, a man has already taken advantage of the lack of masks in the city. While pharmacists display signs telling customers that masks have run out, he has set up a stall in the market selling packages containing 14 masks for €5. Despite the fact they resemble dust-cloths, judging by the number of traders wearing them, business is going well.“Unemployment is widespread here in Ballarò and people make do as best they can,” says Francesco, known in the area as Terza Putia (Third Shop) – the number of his fish stand.Last Wednesday night, Ballarò market was cleared, after the government ordered the closure of all shops, including market stalls. Before that traders wore masks and gloves though the streets were empty of customers.“It is a very serious problem for us,” he says. “Here, we mainly sell fish and fruit. Our economy is based on the daily struggle to sell our products. For those who sell fresh fish, even a day without customers is a huge loss. In Ballarò, if coronavirus doesn’t kill us, hunger will.”Bars, pizzerias, restaurants: everything is closed in the city. The tables placed outside, on the streets of Palermo, are empty. The only business allowed is home delivery. At Pizzera la Brace, at the gates of the old Borgo Vecchio district, Samuele Agnetta, a 27-year-old pizza maker, is working tirelessly, all day, in front of a red-hot wood-burning oven.The Confturismo-Confcommercio tourism confederation estimates a loss of €5bn-€7bn if the crisis continues until May, with an estimated 22 million fewer visitors in the next three months. “There was a queue here every night,” he says. “Before coronavirus, it was difficult to find a table. Look now – empty. Usually we have three chefs here. Today, I am alone, and 25 of the waiters and cashiers have stayed at home. There is no point making calculations because the economic damage will be incalculable.”On top of Monte Pellegrino, overlooking the sea and the entire city, is the Sanctuary of Santa Rosalia, built in 1629, in the place where the saint’s bones were found. Inside the cave, there is a gilded statue of her contained in ornate urns and surrounded by relics.Tourists are few in these parts, especially in this period, but those who stop by leave a message in the visitors’ book at the entrance. “Santa Rosalia, save us from the coronavirus,” reads one of the most recent ones.“From the beginning of the outbreak, two out of three messages written in the visitors book are on the coronavirus,” Gaetano Ceravolo, the parish priest, says. “Palermitans are very devoted to the saint. Especially at times like this.“It is not the first time a virus has claimed victims in the city. Here, in 1600, there were between 50 and 100 deaths per day. It was a massacre. Even then, there was a quarantine. Those who did not respect the ban, forcing them to stay at home, were hanged.”Now, by order of the religious authorities, all masses, funerals and marriages are banned to try to limit the spread of coronavirus. To encourage his faithful to remain indoors, Gaetano live-streamed Pope Francis’s Angelus prayer service on the sanctuary’s website. “It is not going to mass that makes us Christian. This virus is likely to drive us away from each other. Instead we must look for the good, even in such dramatic situations.“If we cannot embrace or exchange a handshake, then we take the opportunity to smile at each other, to exchange words of affection or simply to look at each other. We need to make the best of this crisis. It is the only way to survive.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/075a08e72112cf8abed17868774124d706c578dc/0_0_4320_2592/master/4320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3260d4de507990cf4c8d94cfac4f41a2","title":"revolutionary guards enforce coronavirus controls iran","story":"Streets, shops and public spaces to be cleared in next 24 hours after virus kills hundredsIran’s Revolutionary Guards are to clear streets, shops and public places in the country within the next 24 hours, in a dramatic escalation of efforts to combat the spread of coronavirus.The near-curfew follows growing exasperation among MPs that calls for Iranian citizens to stay at home had been widely ignored, as people continued to travel before the Nowruz new year holidays. Shops and offices have largely remained open.Controversy over the health ministry’s authority within government and the haphazard way in which Iran’s provinces were implementing its advice has led to the change in tactics, and a clearer role for the army. The failure to impose a quarantine around the spiritual city of Qom, seen as the centre of the outbreak, has caused anger on social media.There have also been complaints that the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, has not been taking a sufficiently hands-on role in the crisis.Official figures, disputed by foreign media and opponents of the regime, show the numbers of dead in Iran have climbed to 514 and the numbers infected to 11,634. Hospitals in some provinces have been overwhelmed by the demand for treatment.Satellite images released this week showed what appeared to be mass graves in Qom, suggesting Iran’s coronavirus epidemic is more serious than authorities are admitting.The pictures show the excavation of a new section in a cemetery on the northern fringe of the city in late February, and two long trenches dug by the end of the month.The new steps, reflecting a transfer of power from political to military rulers, and ordered by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was announced by the armed forces commander-in-chief, Mohammad Baqeri. He said the intervention would start in the next 24 hours and last as long as a week. The volunteer Basij force will be involved in the programme, which will include phone calls, internet contact and house-to-house visits.As many as 1,000 fixed and mobile detection clinics were being set up as part of the plan. He said the army would step in alongside nurses to set up a corps of staff, including volunteers that could work alongside exhausted medical workers. Army factories were producing face masks and gloves, and 6,000 army hospital beds were being made available, he said. The health ministry said it was setting up a national coronavirus mobilisation programme to increase early detection and had already piloted implementation of it in five provinces.A spokesman claimed the pilot scheme had already reduced the scale of infections in Qom and Guilan provinces so that the total number of new cases for the first time was exceeded by the numbers recovering.The aim was to identify patients at the first stage of the disease and prevent them from circulating in the community, as well as those associated with them, so cutting the transmission chain.Despite Iran’s reputation as an authoritarian state in which human rights are ignored, the opening fortnight of its fight against coronavirus has been marked by citizens demanding the state take more draconian and consistent steps to bring the disease under control. An earlier proposal for a house-to-house detection system was criticised on the grounds that it might lead to the spread rather than the containment of the disease.Khamenei had tweeted the day before: “Evidence suggests this could be a biological attack. So the fight against the coronavirus can be left to the armed forces, and it can also be a biological defense combat exercise and increase our national authority and capability.”Iran’s foreign ministry spokesman, Abbas Mousavi, joined in the row, saying: “Instead of hypocritical compassion and disgusting boasting, stop economic and medical terrorism so that medicine and medical equipment reach the medical staff and people of Iran.”“By the way, pay attention to the American people too!” the spokesman advised US officials.Iran has asked the International Monetary Fund for $5bn in aid to help combat the crisis but may well find the request is blocked by the US. Any hopes the crisis would lead to a temporary truce between Tehran and Washington appear to have been dashed by an Iraqi militia attack on a US army base in Iraq."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/068d65cec4394c6141828fdcbfb01a09121414f2/0_175_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6786977fb96f874b8b6d7115b9b14857","title":"answering the coronavirus puzzles baby covid 19","story":"The Observer’s science editor looks at questions such as why the disease does appear not to infect children, and whether men are really more susceptibleEarly on Saturday morning the news broke that a newborn baby had tested positive for coronavirus in a London hospital. The child is thought to be the youngest affected by the disease in the UK.The child’s mother had been admitted to hospital days before the birth with suspected pneumonia. Tests – at North Middlesex hospital, in Edmonton – revealed she had the coronavirus. Then, minutes after she gave birth, her baby was given a test which was also positive for Covid-19. It is not known whether the child contracted the disease in the womb or was infected during birth.“The information suggests that children are less likely to be infected than adults and that is a bit of a puzzle,” says Professor Jimmy Whitworth, of the London School of Hygiene \u0026amp Tropical Medicine.One suggestion put forward by researchers is that children have upper-respiratory tract illnesses most of the time. “It may be that they are simply not reporting themselves as feeling ill,” adds Whitworth. “So they are not getting tested. It could be just a sampling issue.”Alternatively, it is possible that other human coronaviruses – which are known to cause minor colds – may be circulating in schools and playgrounds and these could providing a degree of cross protection against Covid-19. “Or it could be something to do with social mixing,” says Whitworth. “We know children interact mostly with other children and adults mostly interact with adults. It is not as though the whole of society mixes randomly. So those differential mixing patterns might explain part of it.”The low numbers of Covid-19 infections among children is not the only mystery. It has been known to science for only a few months and many of its features continue to puzzle experts. One of these concerns hypertension – high blood pressure. Studies of Chinese cases suggest that adults with high blood pressure are more at risk of dying from coronavirus than others.Again scientists find it difficult to find simple explanations. “It may be such iniduals have other conditions that have not been recognised,” says Tom Wingfield, a clinician at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. “We know that people with hypertension are more likely to be diabetic and have impaired kidneys, for example. That could be a factor but the honest answer is that we just do not know at present.”Most experts say this is explained by the fact that in China smoking is primarily a male prerogative and this has weakened men’s respiratory systems and made them more vulnerable to Covid-19."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7200859fb487792e1336e456cb1a1b0c126614c/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2703eda6c4eb79ac8c11ea9b07ca2183","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance who","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:China has been at the centre of the outbreak since the virus was first detected in November, and still has the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths, at 80,801, and 3,176 respectively. However, figures released from the country’s national health commission reveal that the number of cases brought in from abroad has exceeded those infected domestically for the first time, indicating that China’s role in the crisis may be diminishing.The WHO spokeswoman, Margaret Harris, has cast doubt on the UK’s decision to take a herd immunity response to the coronavirus outbreak. Harris told BBC Radio 4’s Today: “We don’t know enough about the science of this virus, it hasn’t been in our population for long enough for us to know what it does in immunological terms.” She warned that each virus functioned differently, implying it was difficult to tell if the herd immunity approach would be effective in this case.The low budget airline said the move came in response to “local measures introduced throughout Spain to prevent the spread of Covid-19, including the closure of bars, restaurants, shops and activities”, as these measures would impact holidaymakers in the destinations. The airline said it was contacting customers who were planning to travel, or currently doing so, amid reports some flights in transit had been turned around mid-air.This step will enable the country to take greater steps to combat the spread of coronavirus, including drawing on the state disaster response fund. The country currently has recorded 82 confirmed coronavirus cases and two affiliated deaths.Austria will make a €4bn aid package available to deal with the economic impact of coronavirus, Sebastian Kurz, the chancellor, and Werner Kogler, the vice-chancellor, said on Saturday. The package was designed to provide “fresh blood” for the economy, including bridge loans and credit guarantees for businesses.Italian citizens in lockdown, trapped in their homes, have been seen sitting on balconies and singing together to support one another during the national quarantine. Some have brought musical instruments to create the spontaneous shows of solidarity, which have occurred across the country.US officials have confirmed that the president’s daughter has been working from home “out of an abundance of caution” after she met the Australian home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, who later tested positive for coronavirus. Dutton also met the US attorney general, William Barr, who is also staying clear of the White House. Neither is showing symptoms.From Monday, foreign travel will be banned and foreigners will be barred from entering the country. Most shops and restaurants will shut for 10 days, but food stores, pharmacies, banks, post offices, gas stations and takeaway food establishments will be exempt from the closures.As of today 71,715 people have recovered, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.In the UK, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should:More NHS advice on what to do if you think you have been exposed to the virus can be found here, and the full travel advice to UK nationals is available here.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.As of 14 March, more than 148,000 people have been infected in more than 80 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have over 5,500 deaths globally. Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. More than 71,000 people have recovered from the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7cb12310e55350b31e48ec8f1c0679dd98cf0940/273_654_3508_2105/master/3508.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22ba0cc3e4c796deb35751059e3fa414","title":"coronavirus teaching union asks pm why schools are not being closed","story":"National Education Union asks Boris Johnson why UK is not following example of other countriesThe National Education Union – the largest of its kind in Europe – has written to the prime minister calling on him to clarify why he has not closed schools as part of the UK’s coronavirus strategy.The letter underlines staff concerns about UK policy, which has been criticised for being out of step with other nations’ responses to the pandemic.The NEU’s joint general secretaries, Mary Bousted and Kevin Courtney, wrote: “Every day we are getting increasing numbers of questions from teachers and support staff asking why the Westminster government isn’t following the pattern of other countries in calling for periods of school closure.“Those questions are increasingly asking why schools aren’t closing if mass gatherings are to be suspended.“We all want to limit and delay the spread of the coronavirus and we do think medical advice and expert scientific advice is important in this regard.“But it is clear that such advice can have uncertainties and that it could be crafted to target a variety of measures.”The letter goes on to propose that parents and schools could work together to find solutions to problems such as NHS staff shortages that would occur as school closures increase childcare needs.“Teachers and other staff would work to help a broader societal response to mitigate the effects of the virus. We know this is especially important in a country where public services and the NHS in particular have been run down for so long,” it says.The letter comes as the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) urged the government to cancel Ofsted inspections immediately in light of the coronavirus outbreak.The ASCL’s general secretary, Geoff Barton, asked the government to suspend all inspections with the exception of establishments with safeguarding concerns.The ASCL will meet the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, to discuss the issue on Monday.Barton said: “At this time of national emergency, schools and colleges are devoting all of their time and all of their energies and all of their resources to keeping calm, to carrying on.“They are preparing contingency plans in the event of closures. This is not a time for business as usual.

They waved over at us and we waved back. We’ve never met.“A little later I heard the sound of people using pans to beat out a rhythm. It turned out to be two elderly women, both small and physically frail, who were testifying in this way to their love of life and of the city. I took two pans myself and followed their beat. Then we said goodbye to each other and closed our windows as it was getting too cold to carry on.”Claudia Bucchini and Andrea Zucco, who both teach music at the Fiesole music school also performed on their balcony. The Scottish singer Lewis Capaldi posted his appreciation of a quarantined singer performing one of his songs from their balcony. A video, posted on Twitter by Alasdair Mackenzie, shows an unseen person singing Capaldi’s Brit-award winning song Someone You Loved. The star retweeted the video, commenting: “Amazing stuff! Stay safe.”Videos of Italian citizens in lockdown arecirculating widely on social media as people sing and dance at their windows or on their balconies to keep up morale. A recording made in the city of Siena in Tuscany has been viewed more than 600,000 times on Twitter. It shows residents singing the traditional Canto della Verbena about the city from their windows. One verse includes the phrase “long live our Siena!”.The Italian singer Andrea Sannino has made a compilation on his Instagram feed that shows people singing his own song Abbracciame (Embrace Me) at their windows in Naples, his hometown.The Italian tune from the 1990s, Grazie Roma, with the lyric, “Tell me what it is which makes us feel like we’re together, even when we’re apart” is also popular online.Quieter neighbours have been using social media to encourage Italians to put up placards on their homes that read “andra tutto bene”, or “everything will be OK”, accompanied by a picture of a rainbow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e637836f24f79ae876f35c384bf4e4f0ae9a3f12/0_11_2736_1642/master/2736.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4578edcb3aa28c1e6a93c84dcdbf4a3f","title":"weddings easter coronavirus tourism holidays","story":"It was only a small wedding, but even those take a lot of planning and Giles Dilnot had not factored in Covid-19.With the prospect that a bridesmaid might not be able to fly in from Norway, and the health risk to some elderly guests, Dilnot and his fiancee decided to postpone a wedding just before Easter that they had spent months organising.“There comes a point when what you want to happen just has a high potential to be overtaken by what is predicted to happen,” said Dilnot, who works for the children’s commissioner. “Suddenly your head starts telling your heart to be a responsible adult and make a call. Not an easy one, but there’s the prospect of doing it later this year and we’re holding on to that.”Thousands of people face a similar dilemma in the next few weeks, when wedding season gets under way, schools break up and holidays are meant to begin. The uncertainty accompanying the coronavirus outbreak means events even a month away seem impossible to plan for. So some people are looking at their diaries – and effectively cancelling Easter.Bernadette Chapman, head of the UK Alliance of Wedding Planners, said her members had been cancelling weddings planned for this month and next. “It’s weddings with a high percentage of international guests,” she said. “You would have ended up with a wedding with a quarter of the guests turning up, so the couples have decided to postpone.”The impact on wedding planners, photographers, musicians, cake designers – most of whom are self-employed – could be severe, she said. Most planners have the capacity for about 10 weddings a year. “Weddings that are postponed are fine, but our members then can’t fill days this year, and they would have sold next year’s dates anyway.” Some could lose “almost a season” of their income, Chapman said.Easter looks even worse for travel and tourism. Joss Croft, chief executive of UKinbound, said businesses relying on staycationers or overseas tourists coming to the UK “may only have a few weeks left to survive”.In theory, many travel bans should be over by Easter. Italy’s borders are scheduled to reopen on 3 April. The Premier League and Champions League will be under way again. India will start issuing visas again and Europeans will be able to resume flights to the US.Yet with events after Easter also being postponed, such as the London Marathon and the local and mayoral elections in May, no one feels confident enough to book holidays. Tour operators are seeing a “huge decline in new bookings over the past couple of weeks”, according to David Hope of GfK, which monitors package holiday sales.By Friday afternoon most attractions in the UK were following government guidance to stay open, with hundreds of Easter egg hunts planned. The National Trust is pressing ahead with Cadbury egg hunts at its heritage landmarks and Historic Royal Palaces still hopes families will come to Hampton Court and Kensington Palace to find Lindt bunnies.A few organisations, such as GoFest, which organises Easter active children’s camps, have warned that if the government decides to ban small gatherings then they may be forced to cancel. Eventbrite was showing nearly 2,000 Easter activities available across the UK on Friday, and so far only a handful of organisers have postponed events in April.The Church of England is still keen to celebrate Easter and will be issuing guidance “in due course” but it has already warned clergy not to wash people’s feet, a ritual often performed on Maundy Thursday, or allow people to kiss the cross as part of Good Friday rituals performed in some churches.Hilary Trahair, events manager at the Association for Project Management, said there were ways for people to plan ahead, in spite of the uncertainty.“People should look ahead and think about different scenarios,” she said. “What impact could they have and how likely are they to happen.” The next step is to look at the risks – such as risks to health or finance. “And then work out, based on the impacts that would have, what would your decision be?“So when you get to the crunch point, you’ve already made the decision – you really don’t have to think about it. And you can focus on putting your action plan in place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c378a0f129363ffb36f8b9f719141ce6da4f3382/0_400_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a7a6c240813efee3627a2f0530e2d2d","title":"what is a pandemic coronavirus covid 19","story":"The WHO has declared the Covid-19 outbreak to be a pandemic. But what does that mean?Declaring a pandemic has nothing to do with changes to the characteristics of a disease, but is instead associated with concerns over its geographic spread. According to the World Health Organization, a pandemic is declared when a new disease for which people do not have immunity spreads around the world beyond expectations.Cases that involve travellers who have been infected in a foreign country and have then returned to their home country, or who have been infected by that traveller, known as the “index case”, do not count towards declaring a pandemic. There needs to be a second wave of infection from person to person throughout the community.Once a pandemic is declared, it becomes more likely that community spread will eventually happen, and governments and health systems need to ensure they are prepared for that.An epidemic, on the other hand, is a sudden increase in cases of an illness or disease that can be unique to one country or community.Ultimately, the WHO gets the final say. There is no threshold, such as a certain number of deaths or infections, or number of countries affected, that needs to be met. For example, the Sars coronavirus, identified in 2003, was not declared a pandemic by the WHO despite affecting 26 countries. However, its spread was contained quickly, and only a handful of nations were significantly affected, including China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Canada.If declaring a pandemic triggers global panic, this can defeat the purpose of trying to raise awareness. Much has been written about whether the declaration of H1N1, colloquially known as “swine flu”, as a pandemic in 2009, caused unnecessary panic, overwhelming emergency departments and causing governments to overspend on antiviral medications. Coronavirus symptoms are generally mild and most people recover within six days.The WHO has stressed that using the word “pandemic” does not signal a change in its advice. It is still urging countries to “detect, test, treat, isolate, trace and mobilise their people”.Dr Nathalie MacDermott, National Institute for Health Research academic clinical lecturer King’s College London, says: “The change of term does not alter anything practically as the world has been advised for the last few weeks to prepare for a potential pandemic, which has hopefully been taken seriously by all countries.“The use of this term however highlights the importance of countries throughout the world working cooperatively and openly with one another and coming together as a united front in our efforts to bring this situation under control.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0eb763183be999a9984302df1e9b413ac8dc4af2/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44a83a4fdb731be212cfdc73520da235","title":"coronavirus closes down italy","story":"With Italy in lockdown, Peter Beaumont charts the spread of Covid-19 in the country while Lorenzo Tondo describes its impact.

Photograph: iStockThe Health Service Executive (HSE) has reiterated its stance that there is no need for parents to have a complete ban on play dates. It comes as playgrounds across Dublin were closed due to concerns over coronavirus. It follows the closure of all schools and childcare facilities . The advice would appear to be contrary that given by a number of medics who have said there should be no interaction between children from different families over the next fortnight. In a statement issued on Saturday, the HSE said “people have to live their lives, children have to play”. It recommended again that children and adults should wash their hands regularly, but it stopped short of recommending that play dates should be stopped. The HSE said: “It would be advisable to limit the number of children attending if you are organising a play date. “Teach your children how to interact, coughing etiquette and how to wash their hands properly. If a child is sick they should not attend a play date or visit older relatives. The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) is currently working up comprehensive guidance for parents which will be posted on the HSE website. At a briefing on Saturday the State’s chief medical officer said: “We are aware in some parts of the country playground have closed, but I think our advice and guidance, and we need to be clear about this in terms of the advice and guidance we’ve made available through our website and continue to make available to parents, that in small numbers those kind of social experiences and exercise experiences for children may still be appropriate.”PlaygroundsDublin City Council has decided to close all of its children’s playgrounds in a bid to stop the spread of coronavirus.The council “revised” an earlier decision to keep many playgrounds in its area open after concerns were raised by councillors. A spokeswoman for the council said the original decision had been not to shut playgrounds, but to instead place a sign up asking users to “ensure hands are sanitisedwashed thoroughly after using the playground”. This was due, she said, to practical difficulties in preventing access to many playgrounds. However, they will now officially be closed even though these difficulties remain in many cases.The u-turn comes after concerns were raised when councillors were told it was “not possible” to close playgrounds operated by the Council, while other local authorities have closed such facilities in an effort to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Fingal County Council, Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, South Dublin County Council and Clare County Council are among the local authorities to publicly state they are closing playgrounds but keeping parks open. According to an email sent to current Dublin City Council Lord Mayor Tom Brabazon by Fine Gael councillor James Geoghagan on Friday night, the chief executive of the council has said it is “not possible” to close all playgrounds.In the email, which was copied to all councillors and has been seen by The , Cllr Geogrhan wrote: “I wrote the Chief Executive this morning inquiring as to whether DCC playgrounds would be shut and I was told that this had been looked at within (the) Parks (department) but was not possible to to do with all playgrounds and that signage was being looked at.”Cllr Geoghegan, who represents the Pembroke area of the South City, said that the official medical advice is that children should not be taken to playgrounds “but this is not being adhered to or is advice that may not be known by parents”.“DCC should announce before tomorrow morning that all their playgrounds are closed and erect signage or lock gates where possible without preventing access to Parks which is essential for people to safely recreate.”He warned: “The more congregating of children in playgrounds, the greater the likelihood of the virus spreading and negating some of the objectives of the school closures.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4201523.1584055098!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus plan sees ireland embark on vast social experiment","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDubliner Breeda Brody masked up  on Grafton Street  to protect against the spread of coronavirus. Photograph: PAYou have to go back to the second World War to look for parallels to the events unfolding in Ireland and across much of Europe. Certainly, there has been nothing in this writer’s lifetime to match the breadth and severity of the measures just introduced by the Government to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Neither is there much in our recent experience to match the speed with which events have unfolded, and the speed with which the threat has escalated.Earlier this week, Ministers indicated Ireland would publish its national plan for tackling Covid-19 next Monday. This was already late in the day Britain published its plan 10 days ago.A plan will provide an anxious public with a route map for dealing with the crisis and show how the Government plans to proceed through the stages to meet, and ultimately see off, the threat posed by the disease.Unfortunately, the situation is worsening so fast that there was no time to wait for publication of the plan before introducing a widespread shutdown of public services and restrictions on public gatherings.This sudden change of pace was further underlined when Ministers on Thursday morning announced the closure of schools and creches countrywide for the rest of the month. About the same time, the Health Service Executive was publishing a guide to “Getting your school, college or educational setting ready for Covid-19”. This document will not be needed for a bit.The Government and public health officials are talking about leaving the present state, when we were trying to contain the virus, to now enter a “delay” phase. There was no talk of a delay phase in the early pronouncement by the experts, who said we would move from containment to mitigation if demanded by circumstances, but the idea seems to have been borrowed from the British plan.Whatever about the phrasing, these measures are drastic and, as Ministers acknowledged, they raise many questions. Closing schools and creches, for example, gives rise to massive childcare challenges for many families. Some parents will have to stop working in order to plug the gaps. Losing healthcare workers as a result would be the equivalent of shooting ourselves in the foot.Will closing schools be effective? And simply shutting the schools is not an answer in itself. Children can become vectors of the disease outside the classroom too, unless they follow the rules of correct hygiene and social distancing. The threat to elderly relatives could rise rather than fall, as a result.The move to pull the shutters down on much of public life was triggered by an upsurge in confirmed cases in recent days, as well as the nature of some of the cases we have. Covid-19 cut a swath through hospitals in Limerick and Cork over the past week, infecting staff and patients and forcing hundreds of contacts into self-isolation.There have been two cases of community transmission, which means we don’t know the source of the infection in these cases. Doctors have been saying for days there is much more out there than has been recorded because we have not been testing widely enough.With computer modelling predicting a rapid rise in cases, it was clear the always stretched Irish health system would be overloaded within weeks. Meanwhile, the disease was gaining a firm foothold across continental Europe, now the new epicentre of this disease.This left policymakers feeling they had only one option: strike hard now in the hope this will delay the onset of cases, delay the spike in admissions and curb the spread of the disease.In the United Kingdom a different approach is being taken. This seems to involve an acceptance of some community transmission, at least at levels with which the National Health Service can cope. Consequently, the social restrictions being imposed are far less intrusive, so far.For now, the Irish public is fully behind the Government’s restrictions. The social distancing and hygiene messages have been clearly communicated and, hopefully, clearly understood. People seem to be up for the vast social experiment involved, whether it involves distance learning or remote working. Whether that remains the case if weeks turn into months remains to be seen.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Chief medical officer urges people to reduce social activities as much as possibleFrance to shut shops, restaurants Coveney warns against non-essential journeys to PolandConcern over coronavirus will allow others to pick up on behalf of house bound peopleFacility used by kidney transplant patients, dialysis patients and families during staysBrittany ferries announce changes to schedules in response to rolling coronavirus crisisVaradkar committed to co-operation as \u0026lsquodifference about is our common objective\u0026rsquoPedestrian pronounced dead at the scene while lorry driver is taken to hospitalIn a bid to disrupt the spread of this virus further advice is now available, so what is it?Management say small size means impossible to ensure recommended social distancingHealth services hope on Monday to have new electronic process to allow GPs to order testsRyanair announces it is to cancel all its scheduled services to and from PolandNational campaign for upper house sees candidates traverse State to meet voters personallySociety calls for HSE to issue specific advice for people with long-term respiratory illnessReplacement Rescue 116 helicopter draws a special heart sign in the squareAll Dublin councils close children\u0026rsquos playgrounds amid concerns over spread of Covid-19Department of Agriculture takes steps in areas such as payment processing, animal testing and mart controlsIreland\u0026rsquos leading producer is at capacity despite producing 50,000 rolls an hourGovernment issues travel warning as borders across the world start to shut to tackle pandemicConcern for childcare operators if Covid-19 emergency measures extendedMany fear being deported during coronavirus outbreak if they come forwardStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4203437.1584215879!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus grogan s pub among several to close for two weeks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Grogan’s pub on South William Street Dublin .Photograph: Bryan O’BrienGrogan’s, one of Dublin’s fabled literary pubs, is among several pubs to announces it is closing its door for the next fortnight due to coronavirus restrictions. Grogan’s, also known as the Castle Lounge on South William Street, has been a haven for artists since it was taken over by Cavan publican Tommy Smith and his business partner Paddy Kennedy in 1972. It quickly built up a reputation as the successor to McDaid’s as Dublin’s most prominent bohemian pub. Its habitués, according to singer Christy Moore in his memoir, included “off-duty pimps, robbers and thieves, poets, actors, saints and spoilt priests”. Doubling as an unofficial art gallery, with many artists displaying their art on the wall for sale, customers love the intimacy and old-school cosiness of the pub. It’s that very intimacy that has prompted joint owner Donal Smith, the son of Tommy, to close the pub as of midnight tonight for the next fortnight. Grogan’s, he has concluded, is simply too small to adhere to the Department of Health guidelines that people should keep a recommended two metres from each other. Such a stipulation would be difficult in a big pub impossible in one the size of Grogan’s with its little nooks and crannies. Besides, he adds, keeping that distance apart defeats the purpose of going to a pub. The pub was reasonably full on Saturday afternoon with drinkers gathering around its little partitioned enclaves while a few regulars supped silently at the counter. Outside a large group of men sat under the awnings at the side of the pub enjoying what has passed for a spring day recently. So much for social distancing. Mr Smith said he made the decision after consulting with Mr Kennedy who remains a partner in the business. “It’s been playing on my mind for the last couple of days,” he said. The pub has closed before, once during Hurricane Ophelia and also during the Beast for the East, but only briefly. “We’ve never seen anything like this, ever,” he suggests. Tommy Smith died last month at the age of 78 and warm tributes, including an obituary in The , testified to his reputation as one of Dublin’s great publicans, but even he never had to confront the present circumstances. “We have to do this, to try and get a handle on it. It’s impossible to keep people two metres away from each other,” Donal Smith said. He and Mr Kennedy intend to“take the hit” and continue to pay the five full-time and nine part-time staff who work in Grogan’s. “It’s not about the money,” he says. “It’s about the health of the staff. Their parents could be older. We had to think about this. This is serious for everyone. Look at what happened in Italy. We have to contain this.” On Thursday the Government called for gatherings of more than 100 people indoors and 500 people outdoors to be cancelled.However it has been left up to pubs to decide themselves if they will close or limit the numbers they allow into their premises as part of efforts to deal with coronavirus.However on Saturday the State’s Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan, delivered a strong warning about compliance with social distancing measures. “There are a lot of anecdotal reports of busy restaurants and pubs. It’s important to get the message out. Listen to the message, take personal responsibility… reduce as much as possible social activity.”Another pub set to close is Anseo. In a statement on its Facebook page on Saturday, Anseo on Camden Street’s management said “after discussing the situation at length” it too has decided to close until March 29th.“This is not a hasty or panicked decision though it is a very difficult one, Anseo is a small family business and is our and our staff’s livelihood.”Cork One of Cork’s most successful publicans has decided to temporarily close over a dozen of his pubs in Cork for the next two weeks in response to calls for a public shut down to curb the spread of the Covid-19 virus.Benny McCabe, who owns the Rising Sons Brewery on Cornmarket Street and The Crane Lane Theatre as well as such landmark Cork pubs as The Oval, The Mutton Lane Inn, El Fenix and Sin E, made the announcement via Facebook.In a statement posted today on Facebook, Mr McCabe said he has decided to close the pubs, which operate as Cork Heritage Pubs, until the end of March in the interests of his staff, his customers and the wider community in Cork.“Folks - Tonight will be our last night serving pints across Cork Heritage Pubs including Rising Sons until the end of March,” said Mr McCabe in the Facebook post this afternoon.“We have worked on building this business over the last 25 years with the custom and support of the people of Cork and now is the time for solidarity across the city and wider regions with our healthcare workers and emergency services,“Cork is a great City and we look forward to bringing you a couple of new venues and a new brewery over the next 12 months, better days are always ahead and I’d like to thank my family and partners and staff for everything to date, I know a lot are looking forward to the break in one way so they can focus on family etc.“Whether you are in business or worried about rent then contact your bank or landlord and of course suppliers and they will work with you and that’s a great comfort to all. Mind yourselves and I’ll see you in a couple of weeks.”Speaking to The  Mr McCabe said his company, which has around 300 staff on its books, will continue to pay their employees for the duration of the two week shutdown which has been in planning for the past ten days or so.“The staff won’t be affected in that they will still have wages - they are not being laid off and people will be paid,” said Mr McCabe, adding that very few pubs in the trade will make profits this year because of the Covid-19 crisis.Mr McCabe said that his decision to close his 13 premises was born primarily out of a sense of social responsibility in that he believed closing the pubs was the right thing to do to try and curb the spread of Covid-19.“I think the situation is moving faster on the ground than people think and I’m not going to wait for something to happen next week - we have a lot of older customers and I don’t want to be known as the fellow who stayed open.”He instanced what was happening in countries such as Italy, Spain and Poland where bars are being shut and it was seeing such developments that prompted him to begin planning this shut down some ten days ago.“We spoke to the powers that be and we got the relevant information for the Revenue Commissioners, we spoke to the banks and Cork City Council and all we are doing is pressing ‘Pause’ on our business for a period.”“It’s not a catastrophe but it is inevitable there’s going to be a shut down here too like on the continent and I think it’s the right thing to do for the integrity of our business and take it on the chin and do it now“But just to leave you with one thought - exactly 100 years ago this year, Cork city was burnt to the ground and the city survived and came back and we will survive this and come back too.”The move comes just days after the Cork Branch of the Vintners Federation warned of the impact of Covid-19 on the pub trade.Chair of the Cork City Branch of the Vintners Federation of Ireland, Michael O’Donovan who said publicans in the city were facing a difficult period as people avoid large social gatherings on foot of government advice.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4203439.1584205879!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish travel advisory issued for poland denmark and other countries","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAer Lingus and Ryanair have moved to secure their business.

This is in addition to earlier advice warning of non-essential travel to Spain, no travel to Italy and exercising caution when going to other EU countries.Ryanair has announced it is to cancel all its scheduled services to and from Poland from midnight on Saturday until the end of March.The move was made in response to the decision of the Polish Government to “lock down” the entire country to contain the spread of the Covid-19 virus, Ryanair said all its flights including those operating under the Buzz and Lauda brands are to be grounded. “We are contacting all affected customers by email to advise them of their options and we urge customers not to call us,” a company spokesman said.“This is a fast-moving and complex situation and the safety and well-being of our people and customers is our main priority. We will continue to comply fully with all WHO and EASA guidelines and we will follow any travel restrictions that are imposed,” he added.On behalf of the Ryanair Group he apologised “sincerely to all customers affected by these Government Restrictions in order to combat the Covid-19 virus.”Meanwhile Aer Lingus and Ryanair have offered passengers the opportunity to change their bookings without incurring a change fee due to coronavirus. The Aer Lingus concession applies to those who have flights booked between now and May 31st and is in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Passengers have until March 25th to change their bookings to a different date or route of their choice. Fare differences may apply. Ryanair says it will waive its €35 flight change fee for customers who wish to change their travel plans due to the coronavirus outbreak. Passengers will still have to pay the difference in fares when changing a flight. Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary has told passengers that had flights been cancelled last week they would have received an email on how to get a refund and a free move. Mr O’Leary said every aircraft is being treated with hospital-grade disinfectant and that all aircraft are already fitted with high efficiency particulate arrestor filters, which remove particles in the air, down to the size of microscopic bacteria and virus clusters. He added: “We hope these policies will reinforce your confidence so that you can book your flights with Ryanair as this Covid-19 crisis will pass and life will return to normal.”Meanwhile student plans to travel to the United States during the summer on J1 visas have been thrown into doubt by a temporary ban.

But the protocol makes clear that Northern Ireland will have to follow the EU customs code, which requires information and checks on goods coming from Great Britain.Irish Sea borderPrime minister Boris Johnson has stated a number of times that there will be no checks and no border in the Irish Sea but Mr Gove said the British government was committed to implementing the protocol in full.“We are committed to making sure that the Northern Ireland protocol is implemented in order to underpin the BelfastGood Friday Agreement.

And he said the government would not publish an economic impact assessment of the free trade deal it is seeking from the EU.“I am personally sceptical of efforts to say that any given impact assessment by a government department is an accurate prediction of the future.

Ireland and Britain have been added to the US travel ban, with the new restrictions taking effect at 4am Tuesday (midnight United States time).Speaking in the White House, vice-president Mike Pence announced the decision to expand the list, after US president Donald Trump implied at a press conference on Friday that he could do so. Mr Trump also confirmed that he had been tested for coronavirus, as he took to the podium at the White House press room in Washington. Acting homeland security chief Chad Wolf said the president had “made the decision due to the rising number of cases in the UK to apply these restrictions to both the UK and Ireland, so as we move forward again, these restrictions bar travel for certain foreign nationals who have been present in the UK or Ireland in the past 14 days”.He added: “To be clear, the president’s proclamation and these travel restrictions do not apply to US citizens.”An official also took the temperatures of reporters in the press room just prior to the press conference, according to those in the room. “Out of an abundance of caution, temperature checks are now being performed on any iniduals who are in close contact with the president and vice-president” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. US president Donald Trump had warned that Britain “and a couple of other” countries could be added to America’s travel ban list, noting the rise in cases in Britain in recent days on Friday afternoon. Asked why he had decided to omit the country from the original travel ban announced on Wednesday, given that several Schengen countries have fewer cases than the UK, Mr Trump replied that he had been advised to do so by experts. However, he said he could change this position, add some countries and remove others from the list. “We’ll be taking another look at that, absolutely,” he said. On Wednesday, the president announced a curb on travel restrictions from Europe to America that were scheduled to go into effect last night. The announcement took European countries by surprise, and it later emerged that non-Schengen countries, like Britain and Ireland, were not included. The new development emerged as Mr Trump declared a state of emergency in the United States, as the number of cases of coronavirus continued to rise and criticism mounted over the lack of adequate testing in the country.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons march 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Comment: Even optimists should quake before the terrifying impact of the coronavirus \u0026#39Pearl queen\u0026#39 designer robbed at knifepoint for £630,000 worth of gemsTrump defends habit of shaking hands during coronavirus pandemicCoronavirus Diary: Rome correspondent describes life in Italy under lockdownDrivers with dash cams risk being prosecuted for their own dangerous drivingBBC \u0026#39refusing to pay enough\u0026#39 to keep iPlayer shows for a yearPrivate beds to be used for coronavirus sufferers as NHS feels strainNatural History Museum responds to demands to repatriate ancient human skill back to Africa US bible museum\u0026#39s Dead Sea Scrolls turn out to be fakeLife slowly resuming normal pace in China as coronavirus cases begin to subside  What is coronavirus, how did it start and could the outbreak grow bigger?EU, Schengen countries close borders as alarm rises over coronavirus Comment: Globalisation brought us unprecedented riches.

Was it mocking the eco-hypocrisies of jet-setting celebs, or dismissing the idea that public anger about the Sussexes was predominantly driven by racism? Or perhaps his ‘radical’ suggestion that the gender of Labour’s next leader mattered less than their policy agenda?Even in these easily-offended times, the backlash was astonishing. Unforgivably, the actors’ union Equity branded him a “disgrace” and urged their members to “denounce” him - all for expressing views shared by large swathes of the public.

Nor was it universally endorsed members of Equity’s ‘Race Equality’ panel have resigned in protest (the worthy Left can never resist a good sub-committee).Yet the gesture, though grudging and feeble, sends a powerful message to the conformist creatives whose views have become a web of hypocrisy. In this topsy-turvy world, authoritarians masquerade as victims, a union can engage in distinctly inequitable behaviour while calling itself “Equity”, and brag about ersity while demanding total conformity of opinion.Though Fox’s views were dismissed as the ramblings of a “privileged white male”, it’s also clear from the veneration of other well-born thesps that “privilege” doesn’t matter if you hold the “right” views - take Hugh Grant or Benedict Cumberbatch. Even belonging to an acting dynasty is fine, provided it’s an aristocracy of Trotskyites like the Redgraves.Fox’s victory is doubly satisfying in a culture which often seems to give the Left unlimited licence to say abhorrent things, while zealously punishing right-wingers for even the most anodyne remarks. Members of the great and the good have wished elderly Brexiteers dead, with no social repercussions whatsoever. Outing herself as “literally a Communist” seems to have furthered the far-Left commentator Ash Sarkar’s TV career - an unthinkable outcome had a right-winger proudly worn the mantle of fascism. Diane Abbott’s admission that “Mao did more good than harm” did not prevent her from being promoted to the Shadow Cabinet. Likewise, the iniduals responsible for Equity’s missives, nestled safely beneath their union umbrella, can expect no real punishment for the damage they sought to inflict. Time will tell whether they have succeeded.Duchess of SussexDuke of SussexThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

With the world in the grip of a pandemic on a scale unseen for a century, the West is finally getting the chance to see what its governments are made of. The results, needless to say, have been mixed. The UK was, until yesterday, a little more reserved than most, with the prime minister, Boris Johnson, making good use of social media (not to mention medical experts) to allay public fears via a series of video clips that plans were in place and that there was no need to panic. Though plenty have called for more action (with Piers Morgan particularly vociferous in his need for “something” to be done) the UK government has at the very least been consistent in following a semblance of a plan, and of communicating it carefully to the public and the outside world. Its announcement that the nation would yesterday move to its second phase, one of delay, is in sync with that measured approach.That is not to say that this is the correct strategy — we simply will not know the true success of it until the epidemic has subsided. But it has certainly appeared more rational than others.One can hardly blame the Italian authorities for rapidly implementing draconian measures on its population in a bid to stem the tide. Italy has an elderly cohort unmatched by any country bar Japan. It is almost uniquely at risk to this particular virus, and with a culture that sees the older members of it less isolated than in Anglo-Saxon counterparts. Nevertheless, Italy’s decision was so hurried, it gave other nations very little time to react — people who left Italy as the restrictions were being put in place arrived at airports abroad, including in the UK, completely bemused and unprepared to respond to such escalation. But that is symptomatic of  wider lack of coordination, and wider reactionary behaviour, across Europe. The outbreak has already caused anger in Italy at the lack of assistance Rome feels it has received from Paris, Brussels or Berlin. Germany even banned the export of protective medical clothing and face masks, whilst China was busy shipping such equipment, as well as doctors, to the peninsula. A patient in a Naples hospital has reportedly been treated with a drug used in China, returning them to being able to breathe unassisted, as part of Beijing’s efforts to assist Italian authorities.The Czech Republic, a country that had no cases a few days ago, has now closed its borders to 15 affected nations, including neighboring Germany and Austria, declaring a state of emergency for 30 days whilst museums, galleries, pubs and restaurants are also subject to measures from complete closure to strict opening times. As in Italy, this policy appears to have been sprung in the aftermath of the number of cases exploding in a very short space of time, presumably long after the virus has entered the country.In the US, though, the tragedy of taking action in order to be seen doing “something” has taken on a farcical element, with President Donald Trump unilaterally deciding that EU citizens travelling to the US from Europe, and vice versa, are to be severely limited, with the sole exception of the UK. Why? No one is really sure — but it has more than a passing resemblance to Trump\u0027s call for “a total and complete shutdown” of Muslims entering the US until he could “figure out what is going on” that he made when running running for office. Sadly, the UK has not proven completely immune to reactionary politicians throwing out decisions at short notice. Yesterday, Nicola Sturgeon, having been present at the Cobra meeting where the next phase of the UK’s response to the virus was discussed, decided to announce the next steps herself before the prime minister addressed the nation, before also adding her own special measures that would apply only in Scotland (not based, apparently, on medical expertise).The effect of this was obvious — to suggest that she was doing more to prevent the spread than the UK government, and in doing so, stoke nationalist sentiment that Scotland would be better off making its own decisions. That kind of political point scoring, and the need to be seen to be doing more, regardless of actual outcome, is the opposite of what the nation needs — at a time when calm heads and unity is required, Sturgeon has chosen to be reactionary and self serving.  Comment: Even optimists should quake before the terrifying impact of the coronavirus \u0026#39Pearl queen\u0026#39 designer robbed at knifepoint for £630,000 worth of gemsTrump defends habit of shaking hands during coronavirus pandemicCoronavirus Diary: Rome correspondent describes life in Italy under lockdownDrivers with dash cams risk being prosecuted for their own dangerous drivingBBC \u0026#39refusing to pay enough\u0026#39 to keep iPlayer shows for a yearPrivate beds to be used for coronavirus sufferers as NHS feels strainNatural History Museum responds to demands to repatriate ancient human skill back to Africa US bible museum\u0026#39s Dead Sea Scrolls turn out to be fakeLife slowly resuming normal pace in China as coronavirus cases begin to subside  What is coronavirus, how did it start and could the outbreak grow bigger?EU, Schengen countries close borders as alarm rises over coronavirus Comment: Globalisation brought us unprecedented riches.

The idea that you have a compulsory tax on the TV set sitting in the corner is dumb,” he told the Financial Times, calling the funding model “an anachronism”.The licence fee has existed since 1927, when it was a levy on wireless radios, and is now £154.50 per year. From this summer, over-75s will have to pay for it unless they qualify for Pension Credit.Other former BBC bosses believe that the corporation should drastically slim down in order to justify the fee.Mark Thompson, who stepped down as director-general in 2012, said the corporation needed to recapture viewers and listeners who have migrated to subscription services such as Netflix, and a younger generation for whom YouTube now has more brand recognition than the BBC.“If that means prioritising streaming and mobile services and making painful choices about existing linear TV and radio, so be it. The BBC has placed bold bets on the future before. In the interests of the audiences it serves, it needs to take the radical path again,” Mr Thompson said.Lord Grade, the former chairman, said the BBC must take “drastic” action to focus its activities. The corporation is desperate to attract younger viewers, after Ofcom warned that it is in danger of “losing a generation” to YouTube, streaming services and other media.It plans to plough millions more into BBC Three, the youth channel that has lost a significant proportion of its audience since moving online four years ago. At a Commons select committee this week, Lord Hall of Birkenhead, the director-general, disclosed that BBC Two’s Victoria Derbyshire Show had been axed because it was mostly watched by a male, middle-aged audience.“They are more male and older than you might think,” he said of the viewers.“They are mainly over-55s, and it tends to attract less women and younger viewers than the average for news programmes.” He added that the programme cost £3 million to make yet its television audience is only 300,000.At the hearing of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, Lord Hall was told that he faced a “public relations iceberg” over the impending over-75s policy as he admitted that 90-year-olds could be hauled before the courts for non-payment.John Nicolson of the SNP, a member of the committee, told Lord Hall at the parliamentary session: “Imagine the reputational damage. The distress caused to these old people.”During the session, Clare Sumner, director of policy at the BBC, confirmed that over-75s may receive home visits from employees of Capita, the firm responsible for tracking down licence fee evaders.However, she insisted that they would be “support workers” specially trained to deal with the elderly. More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/03/13/TELEMMGLPICT000227800527_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"coronavirus has blown away dishonest ideology globalists","story":"While COVID-19 is a new viral infection to which there is, as yet, no immunity, perhaps the actions of governments are also responsible for economic repercussionsThere’s nothing like a crisis to bring people together – or to drive them apart. The critical difference between the two may give us an insight that will last longer than the pandemic. Those people who find that they feel closer to one another – whose concern and sense of shared responsibility come into play almost instantly in the face of danger – generally belong to communities with existing bonds of family, friendship or culture.This is, in effect, the meaning of the word community and it is the very thing that has been undermined and consciously discredited by the great internationalist moves of the second half of the last century.Globalisation and its little siblings, the federated, multinational blocs which now dominate the world economy, have deliberately sought not simply to displace the old order of self-governing nations but to condemn them as... you know the epithets: xenophobic, backward, inward-looking and racist. To seek to preserve a cohesive society in which there are more or less reliable expectations of behaviour, a set of loosely defined but widely understood common values, and a collective history, has been trounced in the modern wisdom.This was, Europe constantly reminds itself (and us), precisely the mentality that ended in the terrible atrocities for which the 20th century will be remembered. What you call “community cohesion”, they say, inevitably ends in racial purity and hatred of the outsider.It doesn’t, of course – except under the most aberrant circumstances and with uniquely wicked orchestration. But that’s another argument. What needs to be observed during the present emergency (if that is what it is) is how differently and distinctively those supposedly extinct national communities – and their political leaders – have responded, and how those responses have been regarded by their own countrymen.Italy, which I know well and love, was characteristically chaotic and insouciant, distrustful as always of government pronouncements because it holds its political class in benign contempt, until finally the government had to resort to authoritarianism – which its population accepted.In the United States, Donald Trump began in his bizarre egomaniacal way with an announcement that managed to be gratuitously offensive, wildly misjudged and horrendously damaging to his own economy. But was it a million miles away from the general American view of what he called a “foreign” virus? There is considerable historical precedent for the US blaming alien intrusion when it is facing trouble.The British position, as personified by Boris Johnson and the two principal non-politician advisors on medical and scientific matters who are his constant companions on the public stage, offers another exemplar. The gradualist approach of the UK Government is defended with impressive expert testimony that is, at once, pragmatic and persuasive. This is also largely in tune with the attitude of the British public which poses, with occasional irony, a good many pointed questions.With my own innate disinclination to accept doomsday scenarios, I offer two examples: why, when the number of cases in the UK is, thus far, lower than that of a bad seasonal flu, and the death toll far lower than for either flu or sepsis, are we in the midst of an official crisis that requires shutting down major, morale-boosting events? And why, if deaths are overwhelmingly occurring among the economically inactive elderly, is this epidemic creating such havoc in the markets?I should not have to say this, but given the scope for malicious misinterpretation, I will: this is not meant to make light of such deaths, just to observe that this virus, unlike the 1918 Spanish flu, is not taking a cohort of young workers permanently out of the economy.Coronavirus UK and regional map ..I get the fact that this is a new viral infection to which there is, as yet, no immunity which makes it exceptionally infectious. But it is difficult not to conclude that it is the actions of governments that have produced these enormous economic repercussions, rather than the disease itself. So the approach of the British (Government and people) strikes me as basically well-judged.Yes indeed, there are grounds for seeing the behaviour of elected leaders as being expressive of what might be called, unfashionably, national character. The tendency for such predilections to cohere even harder during difficult times may be a damnable nuisance to globalists and federalised blocs but it is, I’m afraid, one of the things that makes us recognisably human. Quite simply, it is much easier for a group to join in a sympathetic collective effort to cope with an urgent problem if they are of like mind and communicate in a mutually understood social language.Of course – and, again, I should not need to say this – it is, thankfully, possible to show compassion and generosity to strangers in another land. But that is virtue, not instinct. The evolutionary imperative to join with familiar companions to defeat a threat is overwhelmingly strong and it tends to illuminate differences between communities rather than eliminate them.The recognition of this awkward truth will (or should) have important consequences for dealing with the political future. What was supposed to have been the impregnable solidarity of the EU with its relentless march toward an ever-closer centralised abolition of national identities, has been blown away for the indefinite future – as has probably the Schengen agreement on open borders.The Italian economy is going to tank with far greater consequences for the eurozone than the impoverishment of Greece. Hence the EU is going to be in a far weaker position in its negotiations with a departing UK.But there is a larger truth here that must not be lost. At the end of Albert Camus’ novel, The Plague (in which a pestilence devastates the Algerian city of Oran), a character observes people exclaiming to each other, “We’ve had the plague here!”. “But” he asks, “what is the plague? It’s just life that’s all.” This is life – as it is really lived, not as ideologues might wish it to be.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

However 37 per cent said they did not know either way.  The poll was carried out online on Thursday, before the Government announced the postponement of May\u0027s local and mayoral elections until next year.It reveals that more than half (52 per cent) supported such a move while only 35 per cent said they should take place as planned.Some 88 per cent of respondents said they knew the primary symptoms of coronavirus.Of those, 84 per cent identified fever as a primary symptom, while 87 per cent selected coughing. Official warnings for those experiencing symptoms to remain at home also appear to have been absorbed by members of the public.Asked what they should do if they thought they had contracted Covid-19, 89 per cent selected stay at home while only 3 per cent said the correct course of action was to go to the nearest A\u0026ampE.  More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/14/11/avatar.jpg","title":"avatar 2 avengers endgame highest grossing film box office stephen lang james cameron","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Long-awaited sequel has been in the works for 11 yearsAvatar star Stephen Lang does not share James Cameron\u0027s concerns about the success of Avatar 2.The actor, who will somehow return as the villainous Colonel\u0026nbspQuaritch\u0026nbspin the franchise\u0027s four sequels, was asked whether the new film could surpass the global box office record achieved by Avengers: Endgame in 2019.\u0026nbspLang, obviously recalling that Endgame had to surpass 2009 film\u0026nbspAvatar to claim the victory, confidently told The National: I expect so.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis is a bold prediction considering the film\u0027s director has even expressed his\u0026nbspworry that the world is no longer interested in the universe of Pandora.The director, who has been hard at work on the follow-up to his 2009 blockbuster for several years now, revealed he was relieved to see\u0026nbspAvengers: Endgame\u0026nbspmake so much money as it’s “demonstrable proof that people will still go to movie theatres”.Gugu Mbatha-Raw: ‘There are many different ways to resist\u0027Calm with Horses star Barry Keoghan on ADHD and growing up in careCameron\u0026nbsppreviously revealed\u0026nbspwhy it has taken him so long to begin shooting the sequels, blaming underwater motion-capture technology – something he claims has “never been done before”.\u0026nbspEarlier this year, Avatar fans were treated to their first new look at the world of Pandora in just over 10 years.The\u0026nbspAvatar sequels wil reunite Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana and\u0026nbspSigourney Weaver, alongside new cast members\u0026nbspKate Winslet,\u0026nbspVin Diesel, Jermaine Clement, Michelle Yeoh and Edie Falco.Avatar 2\u0026nbspis scheduled for release in cinemas on 17 December\u0026nbsp2021.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In the UK it went from 5 per cent to 8.5 per cent.Could that happen again? Certainly in theory.Coronavirus means that things will only get worse for the economyIf you put large populations in lockdown they will be unable to spend and that will place local companies – especially those with debt repayments to make – under severe financial strain and they may well go bust and make their employees redundant.Firms could also be at risk if their workforces fall sick at the same time.In the US there are already\u0026nbspreports of jobs going in the transport and tourism sectors.In the UK the domestic airline Flybe has gone into administration, threatening 2,300 jobs.\u0026nbspIts bosses highlighted a slump of bookings due to coronavirus fears.The UK government unveiled a raft of business support schemes, from tax relief to direct grants in the Budget earlier this week. Germany did something similar on Friday.Other countries are very likely to roll out their own schemes.The question is whether these schemes – never tested before – will be sufficient to prevent a spike in insolvencies and the inevitable ensuing redundancies.The post-financial crisis decade has been a bleak one for average wage growth.In the UK inflation-adjusted wages only recovered their pre-2008 peak at the end of last year.Things have not been much better for the median worker in the US on the wage front.Even if governments are able to prevent a wave of redundancies economists will already be revising down the expectations for real wage growth.Companies that are on the verge of insolvency due to a collapse in custom – or firms plagued by uncertainty about the general business outlook – do not tend to give above-inflation pay settlements to their employees.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Ordinary people may experience this as fuel and groceries being cheaper than normal.But if their incomes are under pressure from stagnant wages or from losing their jobs, price deflation will not translate into an overall increase in living standards.This week Italy announced that households’ mortgage payments to banks would be suspended after imposing its total lockdown on the country, recognising that if people cannot work they cannot repay their borrowings.Expect similar policies – with governments putting pressure on banks to offer forbearance for missed payments – to be rolled out in other countries that go down a similar route of lockdown or enforced social distancing.As with falling prices, though, this will not translate into a rising living standards because, although people might welcome a suspension of their repayments, they will also likely face damage to their incomes.It’s important to bear in mind how many households are already financially vulnerable.Around 40 per cent\u0026nbspof iniduals across the developed world countries of the OECD have insufficient money or saleable assets to support themselves at the poverty line for more than three months.“Many workers will have very limited liquidity buffers to tide them over if they cannot earn,” says Adam Slater of Oxford Economics.Their livelihoods may well depend on the willingness – and, crucially, ability – of their governments to provide them with welfare and support.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Normally, you will then have 14 days’ notice, according to Citizens’ Advice.What are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?Latest travel updates as coronavirus continues to spreadCan face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The dirty truth about washing your handsA different kind of notice called a section 21 can be served without giving a reason. The tenant usually has two months to leave the property but the notice period can be longer.Landlords may be willing to make arrangements with tenants to delay rent payments but they are under no obligation to do so.  “If you’re struggling to pay rent, talk to your landlord straight away, says Rachael Gore, senior housing expert at Citizens Advice.“You should explain the situation and could ask for more time to pay or ask to catch up any missed payments by instalments. If you can’t come to an agreement with your landlord, it’s a good idea to pay what you can afford and keep a record of what you offered. You should get advice if you can’t reach an agreement because there is a risk that your landlord might try to evict you.A repayment plan means you\u0027ll make smaller payments to your landlord over a longer period of time. You’ll still have to pay everything back - but it could be easier than paying the full amount in one go.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailDon’t offer to pay more than you can realistically afford, Citizens Advice says. You could make the problem worse if you can’t keep up with your payments.Unfortunately, coronavirus has not changed people’s existing housing rights. In most cases, your landlord will have to give you notice and then get a court order in order to make you leave.If you decide to stay in the property past the notice period your landlord will need to ask a court to order you to leave your home. It is not known how a court would deal with case of renters who have fallen behind because of coronavirus.When the notice period ends, your landlord can apply for a possession order. They must apply to court within a year of giving you the notice. If they don\u0027t, the notice will expire and the landlord can\u0027t use it.Created with Sketch.Coronavirus fears lead to empty streets and shelves across UK Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The usually busy Royal Mile in Edinburgh is empty as people stay away from public areas amid the coronavirus outbreak on 13 MarchHo bart\u0027s Amusement Arcade in Westward Ho!, Devon is offering toilet roll and soap as prizes in grabber machinesAn empty platform at Farringdon Station in London the morning after the Prime Minister said that Covid-19 is the worst public health crisis for a generationShopkeepers Asiyah Javed and husband Jawad from Day Today Express, in Stenhousemuir, Falkirk are giving away facemasks, antibacterial hand wash and cleaning wipes to the elderly in a bid to stop the spread of CoronavirusA usually busy street in Cambridge is empty as people stay away from public areas amid the coronavirus outbreak on 2 MarchA hand sanitiser dispenser is seen inside the stadium during the Premier League match between Manchester United and Manchester City at Old Trafford on 8 MarchMaaya Indian Kitchen in Milton Keynes is offerig customers a free roll of toilet paper with every takeaway orderEmpty toilet paper shelves at a supermarket in London on 12 March A member of the public is swabbed at a drive through Coronavirus testing site set up in a car park in WolverhamptonA passenger wears a protective face mask as she travels on a bus in the City of LondonA Southampton fan wears a face mask before the match against Newcastle United on 7 MarchA loudspeaker placed in grounds of St Mary\u0027s Catholic Church in Broughattin, Dundalk, County Louth ahead of funeral mass later this morning.

You will probably also have to pay your landlord\u0027s legal costs.Only bailiffs appointed by the court can evict you from your home.If you have to take time off work and are not paid, or receive sick pay that is less than your usual wages, you might be entitled to claim benefits, or your existing benefits might increase. Seek advice if you currently receive housing benefit or tax credits, for example.“If you are employed and can’t work at home and you follow NHS guidance to stay at home for 7 or 14 days because of coronavirus you’ll be considered unfit for work, says\u0026nbspKate Smith, senior benefits expert at Citizens Advice. You will qualify for statutory sick pay (SSP) if you usually get it when off work sick.Statutory sick pay is paid for up to 28 weeks.“You can’t get SSP if you’re self-employed, says Smith. If you have paid national insurance contributions regularly for the last couple of years you could qualify for Employment and Support Allowance (ESA).The government has said new claimants suffering from coronavirus or required to stay at home can be paid from day one of the absence from work. Employers with up to 250 staff will be refunded by the government for up to 14 days of sick pay for employees off work because of coronavirus.The National Landlord’s Association said: “We understand and sympathise that some tenants may struggle to pay their rent where they are seeing a temporary drop in their income if they can’t work because of the coronavirus.In such cases it is essential that they inform their landlord at the earliest opportunity and try to work out future payment arrangements.“Where this creates problems for landlords with their mortgage repayments we would hope that lenders give landlords the same flexibility with payment holidays that they are offering to home owners.”Some high street banks have said they will help borrowers who are unable to meet their mortgage or loan repayments on time because of the impact of the virus. Landlords who find themselves in this position are advised to contact their lender.For more information visit Shelter\u0027s website:\u0026nbsphttps:england.shelter.org.ukhousing_adviceShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Across Europe, statutory sick pay averages 65 per cent of median earnings.The pandemic is also shining a light on the UK’s renting rules which give tenants fewer rights than in many other European countries.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Acorn argues that renters should be offered the same leeway.Prem Sikka, a professor of accounting at the University of Sheffield, said the government had provided “basically nothing” in the Budget to help the less well-off who may struggle financially because of coronavirus.“They said they would refund businesses for statutory sick pay of £94.25 a week for 14 days,” Professor Sikka said. “That’s not going to even cover the rent on its own.“A lot of families are in private rented accommodation. It is often overcrowded, they will find it impossible to self-isolate.“For council tenants there is an easy solution which is the government pays money for rent over to the council.“For private renters it’s more difficult – you have a whole variety of tenants from poor to posh. Help needs to be targeted at the poorer end.”He suggested doing this by using data the government already has on who is claiming in-work benefits.“The government needs to take charge and say, ‘We’ve asked you to isolate so we will help you.’”Another method of getting help to people that need it most would be providing an additional one-off payment to universal credit claimants, Pro\u0026nbspSikka said.“This kind of financial help will be very beneficial to the economy because those who have less money tend to spend all of what they have on goods and services.”Richard Murphy, a chartered accountant and campaigner who runs Tax Research UK, believes any private renters who contract coronavirus should be able to live rent-free for up to three months.He wrote in a recent blog post: “Far too many people have too few savings to survive major periods of economic inactivity without massive prejudice to their short-term and long-term wellbeing.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“Should the epidemic spread then as a matter of statutory right any tenant should be provided with a minimum three-month rent-free period to ease the stress upon them whilst this crisis lasts.”\u0026nbsp“I would suggest that the grant of that extension should be automatic to anyone who does not make a due payment of rent on the required date during the period of the epidemic. They should be automatically granted this extension by the landlord without having to make any further application or to complete any additional paperwork.”A government spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“The government has always been clear that our priority is to put people first, which is why there is support in place to help affected people and minimise any social and economic disruption.“We’ve announced a range of measures to support people and communities, including a £500m\u0026nbspfund for households experiencing financial hardship and ensuring statutory sick pay is available from the first day people take off work.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We will be sharing all of the details in the weeks ahead.”The central part of Apple\u0027s WWDC event for the public is a major event, hosted by executives, during which it shows off new updates and products.

As such, speculation had mounted in recent weeks that the company could be forced to pull the event, amid rapidly spreading coronavirus in California and official orders banning large gatherings.It now joins most other major technology companies – including Google, Facebook and Microsoft – in pulling its annual software conference in an attempt to stop the spread of the disease.Apple said it would give $1 million to local organisations around San Jose, where the event is usually held, to offset losses from the new format. The conference traditionally takes over large swathes of the city for a week as developers, the press and others fly in.This year will be the 31st of Apple\u0027s WWDC events, which are traditionally used to update all of its own platforms – such as iOS and Mac OS – as well as introducing new products. They bring together thousands of developers from across the world, leading to fears that this year\u0027s could help spread Covid-19 more widely.Created with Sketch.

Across Europe, statutory sick pay averages 65 per cent of median earnings.The pandemic is also shining a light on the UK’s renting rules which give tenants fewer rights than in many other European countries.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Acorn argues that renters should be offered the same leeway.Prem Sikka, a professor of accounting at the University of Sheffield, said the government had provided “basically nothing” in the Budget to help the less well-off who may struggle financially because of coronavirus.“They said they would refund businesses for statutory sick pay of £94.25 a week for 14 days,” Professor Sikka said. “That’s not going to even cover the rent on its own.“A lot of families are in private rented accommodation. It is often overcrowded, they will find it impossible to self-isolate.“For council tenants there is an easy solution which is the government pays money for rent over to the council.“For private renters it’s more difficult – you have a whole variety of tenants from poor to posh. Help needs to be targeted at the poorer end.”He suggested doing this by using data the government already has on who is claiming in-work benefits.“The government needs to take charge and say, ‘We’ve asked you to isolate so we will help you.’”Another method of getting help to people that need it most would be providing an additional one-off payment to universal credit claimants, Pro\u0026nbspSikka said.“This kind of financial help will be very beneficial to the economy because those who have less money tend to spend all of what they have on goods and services.”Richard Murphy, a chartered accountant and campaigner who runs Tax Research UK, believes any private renters who contract coronavirus should be able to live rent-free for up to three months.He wrote in a recent blog post: “Far too many people have too few savings to survive major periods of economic inactivity without massive prejudice to their short-term and long-term wellbeing.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“Should the epidemic spread then as a matter of statutory right any tenant should be provided with a minimum three-month rent-free period to ease the stress upon them whilst this crisis lasts.”\u0026nbsp“I would suggest that the grant of that extension should be automatic to anyone who does not make a due payment of rent on the required date during the period of the epidemic. They should be automatically granted this extension by the landlord without having to make any further application or to complete any additional paperwork.”A government spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“The government has always been clear that our priority is to put people first, which is why there is support in place to help affected people and minimise any social and economic disruption.“We’ve announced a range of measures to support people and communities, including a £500m\u0026nbspfund for households experiencing financial hardship and ensuring statutory sick pay is available from the first day people take off work.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Many leaders feel it is the luck of the draw. The verdict feels as if it depends more on the inspection team than the framework.\u0026nbspNowhere near enough recognition is given to the context of schools and colleges which are doing great work in relentlessly challenging circumstances.“And, finally, the tone of inspections too often feels combative rather than supportive.”Sean Harford, Ofsted\u0027s national director, is expected to address the conference of headteachers in Birmingham on Saturday afternoon.An Ofsted spokesperson said: “We’re pleased that three-quarters of school and college leaders who were surveyed believe our new approach to inspection is an improvement.”Association of School and College Leaders\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It is about gaps in students’ knowledge from which they might suffer long-term disadvantages,” Mr Hillman saidThousands of\u0026nbsprequests for compensation and complaints have been logged to universities across the UK, the figures show.\u0026nbspIt comes after students have set up petitions calling for refunds.At King’s College London (KCL),\u0026nbspmore than 500 students had their tuition fees partially refunded because of the strikes. More than £640,000 was awarded to\u0026nbspstudents, ranging from £122 to £4,500 each.\u0026nbspAnd yet in other institutions, only a handful of students were given one-off payments. University College London (UCL) paid out just over £6,000 to eight students after they submitted complaints.Jess, a former UCL master’s student, said she sought compensation\u0026nbspafter she missed out on around\u0026nbsphalf\u0026nbspof her teaching time in her final term but her request was refused.She told The Independent: “The main impact it had was on my stress levels. It meant limited access to academic resources and less chance to see tutors.“This limited what we could confidently study and made me, and others, far more worried about the quality of our work.”The English graduate added: “It also created immense frustration because I’d saved for so long to attend and I essentially missed a big chunk of the MA I’d spent the money on.”UCL said refunding tuition fees in respect of industrial action is not part of its policy. Payments were made to students who complained they were\u0026nbspdisadvantaged without appropriate mitigation.\u0026nbspStudents at other universities, including Loughborough, Roehampton and Essex, did not receive tuition fee refunds but were instead offered “goodwill” payments for cancelled lectures and seminars.Essex University allocated £180 to students who had more than 17 teaching events cancelled during the\u0026nbspaction in 2018. Students who missed out on between one and eight events received just £40.\u0026nbspAnd Sussex University\u0026nbspestablished an ex gratia scheme to provide payments to students that suffered distress from strikes in 2018\u0026nbspand 2019. So far £1.1m has been paid out to thousands of students.\u0026nbspThe University of Edinburgh also set up an opportunity fund, made up from money not spent on salaries during strikes, which provided more than £1m to 4,410 students affected by industrial action.At Kent University, nearly 5,000 final-year students in 2018 were offered Amazon vouchers\u0026nbspafter the university received 500 complaints about disruption.Other universities, which have not offered any payments, said\u0026nbspthey have carried out other actions to mitigate the impact on students – including adjusting coursework and exam timetables.Students demand tuition fee refunds for fresh wave of strikesUniversities brace for compensation claims as 43,000 staff strikeStudents demand tuition fee refunds for planned university strikesSome institutions\u0026nbsphave used the money withheld from striking staff to go towards student mental health support.But many of the universities which responded to the request did not set out how they had minimised\u0026nbspdisruption or how withheld salaries would be spent on students.Jo Grady, general secretary of UCU, said: “Students have shown phenomenal support for staff throughout the strikes, and understandably want to hold their institutions to account for the disruption they have faced, so it’s no surprise they are seeking compensation.\u0026nbsp“Students should demand transparency from their institutions on finances and how pay withheld from striking staff is being spent – these are significant sums that should be used for the benefit of students and staff.\u0026nbsp“We would also urge students to put further pressure on vice-chancellors by asking what specific actions they are taking to help end the disputes and avoid any further disruption.”Nicola\u0026nbspDandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students (OfS), said: “We expect universities and colleges to do all they can to avoid disruption for students, and to minimise the impact of industrial action on their studies.\u0026nbsp“That means that they need to think about how best to make up for missed teaching and make clear to students how they will respond if examinations or assessments are affected.“We require universities and colleges to comply with our regulatory conditions during industrial action as at any other time. That means that they must do all they can to mitigate against the impacts of this action, and keep students informed at every stage.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Students rightly expect to get a good deal for their investment in higher education and in the event that any student was seriously affected by strike action we would expect universities to take appropriate action, which could include compensation.”A spokesperson for Universities UK said: “We understand that missed teaching time is unsettling. The specific approach to putting things right will vary by institution.\u0026nbsp“If students feel their studies have been negatively impacted and alternative arrangements are inadequate, they should complain through their university in the first instance.\u0026nbsp“If students are not satisfied with the response from their university they are able to escalate their complaint to the relevant Ombudsman for their country.\u0026nbsp“In some cases, students may be entitled to a partial refund or financial compensation. This would be where there is evidence of a breach of contract where the university has been unable to put in place reasonable alternative arrangements, for example.”University and College Union\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Not contact tracing alone. Not quarantine alone. Not social distancing alone. Do it all.“Any country that looks at the experience of other countries with large epidemics and thinks ‘that won’t happen to us’ is making a deadly mistake.

It’s about reducing waste. I use a combination of different reusable sanitary pads, cotton or bamboo, when I am on my period. A group of women in India makes some of them as a means of sustainable income. It is important to me that they are made of natural materials because I find it most comfortable and eco friendly. Fortunately, I am in the privileged position to think of comfort when it comes to sanitary towels.\u0027526 A reusable sanitary pad Hilary would use during menstruation\u0027I buy these pads mainly from independent stores, most of them are online only, that focus on sustainable products.

Toilet paper and soap are freely accessible but because of sexism, period products\u0026nbspare not. When people are not able to access them, their lives are severely impacted. If you come on your period and don’t have a tampon or pad, it is not just that moment of panic, it’s the constant shame of leaking.”Ms Edlin, who is the founder of the charitable project Bloody Good Period, said she has talked to a woman who was forced to grab a tablecloth hanging on a stranger’s washing line to cope with her period due to not being able to afford products.The campaigner argued there is a massive stigma around\u0026nbspperiods due to\u0026nbspwomen’s bodies being deemed dirty and unhygienic. \u0026nbsp“If you go into a restaurant and there is no toilet paper, you go and tell the waiter,”\u0026nbspshe added. “It needs to be as casual as that to ask for period products.”How one teen’s period poverty campaign sparked change for schoolgirlsPeriod poverty is a widespread issue in the UK – with 49 per cent of girls having missed a day of school due to periods and one in 10 women aged 14 to 21 not able to afford period products.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We would be really hopeful this would be inspirational for other countries, including the rest of the UK. According to the research we have done, 91 per cent agree free products would help girls and young women participate in after-school activities.”Ms Primo said the bill sends a signal that issues which affect women and young girls are being taken seriously, and marks a key step towards creating a more gender-equal\u0026nbspsociety.Her comments come as Kate Forbes, the Scottish finance secretary, argued it is “unacceptable” that women have to fork out so much for period products. Ms Forbes lent her backing to the legislation.Tampon tax scrapped on all sanitary productsAmika George, who successfully campaigned for the government to provide free period products in schools and sixth form colleges, said she hopes the rest of the UK follows Scotland’s lead and makes period products free.“We are starting to see a shift in the way periods are being perceived,” said the 20-year-old, who launched the Free Periods campaign in 2017. “If it’s not prioritised here by government, we will certainly be looking into it.”\u0026nbspShe added: “It’s a human rights issue. Universal access is important because it will ensure that the needs of all genders are met in public places. There is such abject poverty in the UK, and wherever there are difficult choices to be made in families of how money should be spent, period products fall to the bottom of the list of priorities. Where it affects young children who end up missing school because they can’t afford to buy them, we know that the consequences of this are long lasting and can affect the entire trajectory of their lives.“While campaigning, and having had a number of conversations with school nurses, we know that girls have been really reluctant to admit they can’t afford pads or tampons. That’s a direct result of the stigma around periods, combined with the stigma around poverty. Girls would be reluctant to even admit to their friends that they can’t afford period products, and that’s a huge shame.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Schools, universities and tourist attractions closed.Two weeks later, Italian prime minister Giuseppe Conte announced the expansion of the quarantine zone to cover much of northern Italy, affecting at least 16 million people, restricting travel from, to or within the affected areas, and banning cultural events.Many offices closed in Milan and airlines cancelled flights to northern Italy. Industry – from car plants to fashion manufacturers – shut factories.Researchers studying the impact of greenhouse emissions on the climate crisis and human health are scrambling to understand the possible implications of the pandemic.In China, experts said that in the four weeks to 1 March, carbon dioxide emissions fell by a quarter – an estimated 200m tonnes – which is about half the amount Britain emits in a year.And similar satellite images over the country from Nasa also revealed drastic drops in nitrogen dioxide as people stayed at home and industry slowed or closed down.Scientists found the coronavirus wiped out at least a quarter of China’s emissions of damaging greenhouse gases in just two weeks in mid-February.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Spain, which declared a state of emergency on Friday, showed particularly concerning exponential growth, experts said.The modelers in Europe say a similar arc is likely in the United States, but anticipating the spread is made more difficult by the lack of widespread testing. US officials are working with 50 academic modeling groups, but no forecasts have been released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the White House coronavirus task force. One model, for the American Hospital Association, projects a worst-case scenario of hundreds of thousands of deaths.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“Italy is about two weeks ahead of Britain and the rest of Europe,” said Francois Balloux, director of the Genetics Institute at University College London.Observations by epidemiologists show that if unchecked, the number of infections double approximately every five days, with infected iniduals, on average, capable of passing the virus on to an average of about 2.5 people.The dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government’s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?“What we are seeing is not rocket science,” professor Balloux said. “You have two cases, then four, then eight, then 16.”Epidemiologists say that decisive action is required to change the rate of infection and “flatten the curve.” That reality appeared to sink in for some political leaders in the United States and Europe this week, as countries closed schools, encouraged working from home, banned large gatherings and imposed new travel restrictions. French Health Ministry Director General Jérôme Salomon said France must prepare itself for “the Italian scenario.”Still, some experts worry that governments aren’t doing enough to reduce rates of transmission so cases don’t soar exponentially and overwhelm health systems. A lack of urgency in previous weeks may have wasted valuable time, they say.On Friday, the director-general of the World Health Organisation, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said, “Europe has now become the epicenter of the pandemic, with more reported cases and deaths than the rest of the world combined, apart from China.”Irish doctors on Friday warned in a letter to the British Medical Journal that the country is “exactly 14 days behind Italy.” They said only stringent measures could head off a medical crisis like Italy’s and produce a more manageable outbreak like South Korea’s.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailAt the beginning of an outbreak, experts say viral spread can be contained by isolating iniduals and tracing those in contact. But when cases begin to emerge where the infection source is unknown, as they have in parts of Europe and the United States, mass behavioural changes and social distancing appear to be the better strategy.Italy is one country that has had to accept quickly the need for drastic action. Just three weeks ago, it did not have much of a coronavirus problem. Now it has had more than 15,000 confirmed cases. Prime minister Giuseppe Conte extended a lockdown on a handful of small villages to wide swaths across northern Italy on Sunday morning and then to the entire country Monday night. On Wednesday, he went even further, with the announcement of a shutdown of most commercial activity.Italy may have been particularly hard hit in part because the virus spread in the community for several weeks unchecked, and the government has had to play catch-up.Dirk Brockmann, a professor at the Humboldt University in Berlin who does infectious-disease modeling for Germany’s Robert Koch Institute, the federal agency tasked with disease control, said looking at the number of confirmed cases at a particular moment can be misleading – if people think it is just a few thousand cases here and there.“It’s almost like taking a still picture of cars on a highway, it doesn’t tell you anything,” he said. “It’s about how the numbers change.”The current snapshot may be as much as two weeks old, given the time it may take for the virus to cause symptoms and for patients to be tested and diagnosed.Britain’s chief science adviser, Patrick Vallance, said on Thursday that the United Kingdom had 600 confirmed cases, which he said means that 5,000 to 10,000 people there probably are infected.If the virus continues to infect people at its current rate, which is not a certainty, a European country such as Spain, with 3,000 cases, could see 250,000 infected iniduals in about a month, based on doubling times of five days.“Those are the numbers that epidemiologists are expecting,” said Roy Anderson, professor of infectious disease at Imperial College London.“I think it’s highly likely we all go the way of Italy” in the coming weeks, he said.Whether the caseloads explode will depend in part on public health controls, decisions by governments and businesses, and inidual actions, the disease modelers say.Many people were taken aback when Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday warned that 60 to 70 per cent of Germany’s population of 83 million could contract the disease.But infectious-disease specialists say that’s quite possible.“If governments do nothing, or do things that are not effective, and the population does nothing, then you certainly could see 60 percent of a population infected,” professor Anderson said.Some European countries appear to be “renouncing efforts to contain the epidemic,” said Giovanni Rezza, director of the Infectious Disease Department at the Italian National Institutes of Health.“We are applying very tough measures” in Italy, he said. “But in other countries where the incidents of the disease are increasing, it’s like they are not looking at Lombardy,” he added, referring to Italy’s worst-hit region.“For the other countries around us, we should be a lesson. They know the virus is there, so they should act more promptly,” Dr Rezza said.For the United States, Dr Rezza said, there was still a “window of opportunity” to try to contain the virus, given the large geographical area and isolated outbreaks.Infectious-disease specialists say it is possible the case numbers in the Northern Hemisphere will soar in March, and then begin to go down if the coronavirus proves to be seasonal, like common flu, which produces less infection in the warmer summer months.The British government, especially, appears to be hoping the infection rate drops in April and May, but so far there is no evidence to support the optimism.In northern Italy, where the wards are running out of beds for all the coronavirus patients, doctors report they are battling out-of-control transmission.Earlier, a group of Italian doctors sent out an appeal to their colleagues working in intensive care units in Europe.“Get ready,” they wrote.Angelo Pan, head of infectious diseases at a hard-hit hospital in Corona, Italy, warned that without effective containment measures, a similar scenario could be ahead for France, Germany and possibly the United States.“It’s just a matter of time,” he said. “I think we are just maybe 10 days ahead.”Benjamin Maier, who is Brockmann’s research partner at Robert Koch Institute, has plotted the infection curves of countries in Europe and Asia that have seen outbreaks.Spain is showing galloping exponential growth, he said, while Britain, Germany and France are still on a steep trajectory.“You can see that many countries will follow Italy’s example if they don’t follow strict and stricter measures,” Dr Maier said.Those measures can have a significant impact on how many cases develop. Dr Brockmann and Dr Maier examined the epidemiological curves of the outbreak in China. Although Hubei province initially had an exponential growth rate, the government’s massive containment effort, involving mandatory behaviour changes, managed to slow the rate of infection.South Korea, which has carried out widespread testing, has identified nearly 8,000 cases, but the numbers of new infections are tapering off. Singapore, Malaysia and Japan also have seen flatter growth.For those countries facing steep increases in coming weeks, all is not lost, said Alexander Kekulé, a German virologist who heads the institute of medical microbiology at the University of Halle.Acting in advance, rather than in reaction to numbers that lag behind the picture on the ground by weeks, he said, can make a huge difference.“This really decides if you win the battle, or you lose it,” he added. For weeks, Dr Kekulé has publicly urged Germany to act more swiftly with measures to ban mass events, close schools and test everyone who has flu-like symptoms.But China’s swift and drastic action is more of a challenge in Western democracies.Politicians in Europe have been slow to make proactive decisions that could be lifesaving until the danger has sunk in for the public, said Dr Kekulé, meaning they are reacting, rather than getting ahead of the curve.The fact that German Health Minister Jens Spahn recommended events with more than 1,000 people be stopped on the same day that the first German national died was no coincidence, he said.“It’s always the problem of a Democratic system you have to explain yourself to your voters on why this measure has to be taken,” he said. “You have to wait until it’s hurting.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Or fully grown adults wearing replica football shirts  Or better still, bottled water — the real environmental scandal of our time.But cigarettes aside, Rishi Sunak’s first Budget as Chancellor ticked all the right boxes.In parts, quite a lot of parts, it sounded like a moderate Labour Budget.By which I don’t mean the kind of thing the wretched John McDonnell might have delivered — free unicorns for the poor and all people who earn money to be shot etc.I mean the Labour Party when it had an ounce of common sense.There was good populist stuff in there, especially the pledge to mend the potholes.I can’t be the only bloke who has had to fork out for a new tyre because of a hole in the road the size of the Isle of Wight.A lot of the Budget was, reasonably enough, directed at battling coronavirus.Help for businesses and sick pay for those who miss work and wouldn’t normally get it. And pretty much a blank cheque for the NHS.All of this was necessary, but it meant that much of the good stuff in the Budget got overlooked a little.This Government was brought to power by the votes of former Labour supporters in the North andthe North East.Parts of the country which, in the past, Conservative governments have left to rot.It took a lot to get those people to vote Tory — and they won’t do it againthere isn’t substantial investment in infra-structure for our northern towns and cities.The Chancellor addressed this. He announced a massive increase in capital spending.Some £billion will be spent investing in infrastructure.That’s the highest level in real terms since Clement Attlee’s excellent Labour government  years ago.We don’t know where it’s all going yet.If it gets swallowed up by the largely daft HS rail scheme, that will be a mistake.Sunak, though, knows the North East. He knows we need big investment to make these places attractive to business and to those who might move there.He knows too that we need to disperse high-paying jobs to the regions.So there’s going to be a new economic campus in the North and , civil service jobs moved from the capital to the regions.Excellent. This is what Boris Johnson means by “levelling up”.For too long London and the rest of the UK have been effectively two separate countries.So, the cigarettes apart, this was a fine Budget which should reassure those new Conservative voters that this government WILL look after their interests.And the latest opinion polls  Tories on  per cent.Labour way down on even its pathetic election share.So far, Boris and Rishi have not put a foot wrong.But here in the North we’re still watching, gentle-men. And hoping this is just a start.Fiddling with the constitution to ensure that he can remain president until . . . .That means he will have been president of his country longer than that chap he quite admires, Joseph Stalin.And will be  years old when he finally stands down.If he does stand down then.Unless it was with a qualying clause such as “hasn’t got very much”.The poor bloke has presided over a string of botched initiatives as a minister.I wouldn’t wish to be rude, but my suspicion is that a plaster garden ornament – a gnome with a fishing pole, or a heron – would do the job better.The hoarding of non-perishable food items, such as crates of Jack Daniel’s and tinned pies. You can’t be too careful.I suppose I also understand people buying hand sanitiser – asit had suddenly occurred to them that having clean hands might be a good idea.But what’s with the toilet paper  Is that really your first thought at a time of crisis  And the amount of the stuff people are buying!Lordy,that’s how many rolls they need, I think Covid- is the least of their worries.It’ll be the same when Armageddon comes, when the nukes are flying hither and thither.All the supermarkets will be stripped of vanilla-scented soft ply.“If I’m going to meet my maker, I will do so with a very clean arse.”They usually keep a bucket, or something, of the stuff outside the front door. It’s blessed by the monks, I think.Anyway they’ve discontinued the practice for a while to prevent the spread of this singularly annoying virus.And people are saying – well,it’s holy, it can’t possibly be tainted with flu virus, can it There’s one born every minute, isn’t there THE Labour Party is continuing its long and exciting journey from being a government in waiting to being a small organisation for the terminally deranged.Their latest act has been to suspend the last remaining sane member of the party, the excellent Trevor Phillips.He’s a lelong campaigner against racism – but has been suspended for being Islamophobic.He has never been remotely Islamophobic.If Phillips had been leading the Labour Party at the last election, we’d probably have a Labour government now.Instead, it was led by a rabble of anti-Semitic, far-left loons obsessed with identity politics and Palestine.I’M still not sure we’re doing the proper coronavirus checks on people flying back from their bloody skiing holidays in Italy.There are reports of many passengers receiving no checks at all.Surely anyone who has been to Italy should have been advised long ago to self-isolate – and inform the authoritiesthey feel poorly.I think we will regret not having done this.Well done British Airways for cancelling all flights to Italy.

Both of those measures are aimed at preventing onward transmission.The third intervention, which will be introduced when the number of cases is starting to rise sharply, is to isolate those people who are most susceptible to developing serious illness, such as the elderly and those with underlying health issues.Stopping large gatherings this week would only have reduced the peak of the epidemic, when it arrives, by less than five per cent.If we banned people from attending football matches, fans might well watch the games in the pub instead where they may be more likely to be infected.For schools, we would need to shut them for at least eight weeks.What we know is, that for the first couple of weeks, the children might stay at home but people would soon adapt their lives.Parents might start to look after children in groups, which would defeat the purpose, and you would have taken key workers out of the front line to stay home with kids.If a child is in school, teachers will encourage them to wash their hands properly, which is critical.From my own experience, children at home in the holidays are a lot less likely to wash their hands so often.The idea of preventing visits to care homes has been raised.It wouldn’t matter whether it was coronavirus or seasonal flu — all care homes discourage visitors who are sick.Detailed work has gone into balancing the needs of the elderly.  Telling somebody who is , lives at home and doesn’t have support, not to come out is dangerous.We need to maximise the protection for them at the epidemic peak, which will come somewhere between ten and  weeks.Taking an elderly person away from others for such a long period could have a very damaging effect on their mental well-being.When we supported people ing from Wuhan in China into isolation we were ultra-cautious during our containment phase and asked people to isolate for  days, to check to see whether they developed infection.Our evidence isyou are infected you will usually show symptoms in five to seven days.Now. we are focusing on people who have symptoms we are dealing with people who have had the disease. After seven days and,they are feeling better, they will have built up some antibodies and will be safe to go back out.They won’t be infectiousthe symptoms have gone.There has been a lot of discussion about the notion of herd immunity but that conversation has gone a bit awry.Anybody who has been infected will build up antibodies and we think they will be immune.While the virus remains stable — and there isn’t a new strain — we don’t think they will get infected again during this season.Having an immune population is generally a good thing. But that is a natural by-product of an epidemic — it is definitely not the main feature of our planning. AS we face the biggest crisis for a generation in the fight to beat    Covid-  — following official advice is vital.Every area of our society is to be hit as the virus begins to peak.And advice is changing quickly, so here we bring you some key information across four of the very important areas.Do not go to a GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital.Testing is not neededyou are staying at home.The elderly  and those with underlying medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, MS and COPD are at increased risk.Use the   online  serviceyou feel you cannot cope with symptoms at home,your condition gets worse or you do not get better after seven days. Only call you can’t get help online.If you are staying home  keep at least two metres  from  others.Sleep alonepossible. Regularly wash  hands with soap and warm water for at least  seconds.Drink plenty of water and take  paracetamol and ibuprofen to help with your symptoms. If  self-isolating, don’t leave the house for a walk or go to public places or schools.Use  www.nhs.uk  coronavirus for info.HELP is there for workers who get the virus or have to self-isolate — but it ies.Some firms, typically bigger ones, offer full pay for those who test positive, and somestaff have to stay at home.Other companies provide the minimum statutory pay of £. a week set by Government.The good news is this is now from day one — until new coronavirus laws it was not until day four. The advice is to not go to workyou have a cough or a fever.Some such as store staff or drivers cannot. Brits who can work from home — such as office workers with a laptop — will be asked to do so.Those on a zero-hours contract can also get sick pay so long as you’ve earned an average of at least £ a week before tax over the past eight weeks.The self-employed need to apply for benefits.Many supermarkets have already put limits on essentials such as anti-bacterial gels, wipes, dry pasta,  UHT milk and  tinned veg.It is reasonable to have enough goods to last you a week while in self-isolation. Online delivery slots have been dficult to come by but it is worth booking ahead.Tesco and other companies let you sayyou are self-isolating on your order. Drivers cannot come into your home.TV cleaning expert Aggie MacKenzie recommends for a family of four for a week: A bottle each of bleach, handwash, disinfectant, washing-up liquid plus soap, eight kitchen rolls,  eight loo rolls.THE Government is now advising against all but essential travel to Northern Spain and telling British cruisers over  they should not sail.Disneyland Paris closes tomorrow until the end of the month. Walt Disney World, Florida,  and Universal Orlando are also shutting, as is Disneyland in Calornia.Airlines are reducing their flying schedules and some — including easyJet — are now offering passengers the chance to delay, rebook or cancel trips without any fee.Cruise lines including Disney, Costa, Princess, Viking, Saga, Cruise and Maritime Voyages, Celestyal and Virgin have cancelled cruises and other travel companies are suspending tours and trips.Malta says UK travellers will have to self isolate for  days on arrival.

Teachers and staff are asking the Prime Minister for full disclosure over his decision not to shut schools, particularly now that plans are under way to ban mass gatherings. Boris Johnson said on Thursday that closures now could do more harm than good, hours after Ireland announced that schools and colleges would close for a fortnight. The Prime Minister told a press conference: “We are not – repeat not – closing schools now. The scientic advice is it will do more harm than good at this time, but of course we’re keeping an open view and may change this as the disease spreads. Schools should only closethey are specically told to do so.”The letter sent by the National Education Union reads: We all want to limit and delay the spread of the coronavirus and we do think medical advice and expert scientic advice is important in this regard. But it is clear that such advice can have uncertainties, and that it could be crafted to target a iety of measures. We now see that you may take legal powers to force schools to remain open even when heads and teachers think there is good reason to close. In those circumstances we, as the leaders of the largest education union, believe that it is right for us to ask you for fuller disclosure of the models you have looked at, and to understand which measures you are targeting. We do not have the medical expertise to know what the transmissibility is between children and staff in close quarters in classrooms - but your scientists will have made assumptions about that, together with some view of the certainty of those figures. It is very important that we understand what the increased rate of infection is for staff and parentsschools remain open, including obviously for those with underlying health conditions themselves, or for those they care for. The letter, from the unionaposs joint general secretaries Mary Bousted and Kevin Courtney, adds: We know youaposve expressed concerns about children not in school being cared for by vulnerable elderly grandparents, or by NHS staff who would then not be available for work. However, we would suggest that parents and schools would be able to work together to find solutions to that - and we would like to knowyou have any modelling of such societal responses. Most of all we think that education staff deserve to have access to modelling of the projected spread of the virus and the projected number of fatalities in a wide iety of scenarios including in scenarios where schools are closed for dferent periods of time. Teachers and other staff would work to help a broader societal response to mitigate the effects of the virus. We know this is especially important in a country where public services and the NHS in particular have been run down for so long. However it is vital that you share all of the potential models you have with usthat societal response is to be as strong as possible. Northern Irelandaposs administration has not introduced the same measures as the Republic of Ireland, but Deputy First Minister Michelle OaposNeill said schools and colleges should be shut.

Andrew OaposDwyer, , tested positive for Covid- after the holiday with  friends last month. Sixteen of Andrewaposs pals in the group also caught the deadly bug and some have since passed it onto spouses and family members. But Andrew told Manchester Evening News heaposs since written a diary about his battle. In it, the father, originally of Bury, Greater Manchester, but now living in London, describes his vile fever and how his body temperature rocketed. Do you have a coronovirus story  Email  webnews@mirror Monday, March  This was the day we found out that two people from our group of  were ill. They both ended up in hospital and were among the first  people in the UK to test positive. One of them had shown signs of the illness and it was very quick. They have underlying an heart issue so they were taken into hospital. The other person was a younger member of the group so it was quite surprising when they became ill. He’s only in his s and he became very ill too. We were all up to date with what was happening because weaposre in a group WhatsApp.   I have a nine-year-old son who lives nearby. He understands that I’m not very well and has seen coronavirus on the news. I’m not sure he fully understands what it means but he knows his daddy has to stay at home for a couple of weeks. I had a chat with him via FaceTime when he came from school to let him know I was okay.  Tuesday, March  In the morning my son rang me and said he was at the bus stop across the road from my flat. I looked out the window and waved at him. He told me he was giving me a big hug as he wrapped his arms around himself. I did the same back and told him I loved him. That was a nice boost after a few days in the flat on my own.  By this point, I was running low on food and my neighbour offered to bring me some shopping. I gave her a list of essentials to tide me over in case I became ill. It was just general stuff like bananas, cornflakes, tins of soup and baked beans, painkillers and Diet Coke. That kind of thing. I’m friends with my neighbours and that was really helpful. At this stage I felt completely fine without any symptoms but I didn’t leave the house.  Wednesday, March  This was the first day I contacted NHS  because more people in our group had tested positive for the virus. It took me about  minutes to get through to an advisor. I explained that I’d been in contact with someone with coronavirus and ed from Northern Italy. A clinical advisor called me back around an hour and a half later, and told me to self-isolate, which I was already doing, and that they would send a nurse to my home to do a swab test. Two nurses who were going to do the swab called ahead beforehand. They said to ask any questions over the phone, rather than ask questions when they arrived to avoid any contamination via spittle. At around .pm they arrived in an unmarked car in hazmat suits. They knocked on the door, came in, took two swabs from the back of my throat and left. It took a matter of seconds.  Thursday, March  I got up, ate and did some le admin as normal. I really didn’t feel poorly or anything at this point but I was aware I could be carrying the virus. I carried on with the self-isolation as instructed, and waited for my results. I was told my GP surgery would be in touch to let me know either way. Friday, March  Still feeling fine and chipper. I watched television and did some work from home. No sign of my results, but also no symptoms. Saturday, March  It was now a week since our group had ed from the Dolomites and  people had tested positive for coronavirus. I found out I was the seventeenth person to contract the virus on this day. At around .pm, I received a call from a consultant at St George’s Hospital in London who confirmed I had COVID-.I knew all along I was probably positive and that confirmed I had done the right thing from the start. I was the last one in the group to get my results.  The people who lived in Manchester were among the first ones to get the diagnoses. We’re all in the same WhatsApp group and we’ve had a bit of a laugh and a joke about it. You need a bit of dark humour to get you through these situations.  Sunday, March            This was when I started getting symptoms. I had quite a minor cough. It was very intermittent - I would have a coughing fit for a few minutes every couple of hours. I didn’t think about it too much at the time, but looking back, that was when my symptoms started. I asked my neighbour to buy me a thermometer and post it through the letterbox so I could check my temperature. Apart from the coughing, I was eating and drinking as normal. Monday, March  This was the first day I started to get a fever. I took my temperature at around .pm and it was .C. By pm it .C and at .pm it was .C. I could feel it rising and by then I was feeling physically quite ill.The sporadic coughing fits were becoming more frequent and were lasting for longer. I was having - bouts of coughing and I was struggling with my breathing. Just before pm, my temperature had reached .C and the coughing wasn’t abating. At .pm I decided to call  for an ambulance because I couldn’t catch my breath. The advisor told me to pack a bag and leave the front door open. They told me not to eat or drink anything, and that a clinician would call me back. Two hours later, an ambulance still hadn’t arrived so I shut the front door and went back upstairs. I also went against the initial advice and had something to eat because I’m a diabetic. My sugar levels were really high and I needed my insulin injection. At .pm a clinician called me and by then I had started to feel better. They said the initial information I had been given was incorrect and I was right to eat something. The coughing had subsided, my breathing had eased and my temperature had fallen to . by midnight so I went to bed.Tuesday, March  When I woke up I felt absolutely fantastic, which was surprising considering how ill I had felt the day before. I took Nurofen and paracetamol intermittently throughout the day. But at pm I developed a real chill. I had the heating and gas fire on, and I was under the duvet in a jumper and my ski hat, and I still felt freezing. I was shivering and shaking like a snowman, and by pm my temperature was around .C. It was really quite an intense feeling but by pm the fever seemed to have broken. By midnight my temperature was back to . and went to bed. Wednesday, March      I’d not had much sleep so I felt really groggy and had a sore throat from all the coughing. Someone from NHS  called to do a welfare check because I’m a diabetic. I told them about my fever and the coughing. They decided that they would send someone to do an assessment at my home. At pm they turned up in an ambulance in full hazmats, and decided to take me to St Helier Hospital to be checked over. When we arrived they couldn’t take me in for some reason. A nurse came out to speak to me and by that time I was well. They sent me home and told me to continue to self-isolate. Thursday, March  I did an interview with Hugh Pym from the BBC in the morning and I was feeling okay. It was only in the evening when I had a coughing fit and my temperature went back up. It seems to hit you in bouts. You can feel fine for a few hours and then all of a sudden it hits you.     This was the first night I slept really badly because I was coughing so much. It’s worth saying that this isn’t like a normal cough. It’s an involuntary cough that has you on all fours retching. You cough like you’re a -a-day smoker in their forties. I was hugging the toilet because I thought I was going to be vomit. It’s that which gives you the headaches . I found that anti inflammatories like Nurofen really helped with the coughing. Friday, March  Today I feel almost back to normal, and everyone who was hospitalised in our group has been discharged.  A friend of mine collected my insulin prescription from the pharmacy and some of the mums from school rang to askI wanted a coffee. I’ve weirdly been off caffeinated drinks and have been craving sharp drinks or smoothies. My only concern now is that I’m not going to be tested to seeI’m negative. How are you meant to know that you don’t have it anymore  I really think that’s something they should be looking at to contain this.

The Glaswegian monster, , who died in , never revealed where victim Keith Bennett, , was buried and relatives hope the cases could hold clues. Terry Kilbride, whose brother John was also killed by Brady, previously insisted: “There must be something in those cases.”Brady took his evil secrets to the grave as he died in “distress” gasping for air, the Daily Record reported.But with his final words, he ordered that two locked Samsonite briefcases should be taken from his bedside and handed to his solicitor Robin Makin. He had already insisted they should not be opened until after his death. The revelation at Brady’s inquest in September  gave hope of new clues to locate the body of Keith Bennett – the only victim of Brady and Myra Hindley never to be found. Keith’s mother, Winnie Johnson, died in  without knowing her son’s final resting place. But at the inquest his brother Alan, , insisted the child killer’s death had not meant the “end of the search”, adding: “Let Keith and the other victims be in our thoughts.”  Terry Kilbride, , whose brother John was another of Brady’s five victims, also previously said: “There must be something in those briefcases for him to go to those s to hide them away. “It’s all the hope we have for finding Keith.” And Terry West, , brother of victim Lesley Ann Downey, added: “I would like to know what’s in those briefcases. “Fingers crossed there might be ­something that would finally help us to find Keith’s body.”  Brady and Hindley were jailed for le in  over the killings of John, , Lesley Ann, , and Edward Evans, . In , Brady confessed to the murders of Keith and Pauline Reade, . That same year, he was admitted to Ashworth high security hospital in Merseyside and given the alias Ian Steel, the inquest heard. By the time of his death in May , he was an invalid. He suffered from emphysema, brought on by heavy smoking – a habit he kept up until it was banned at the hospital in . Five-and-a-half hours before he died on May  , he was found to be “laboured in his breathing and agitated”. But he summoned his remaining strength to make a final request. Dr Thomas said: “He asked for his solicitor to be notied and requested his locked briefcases be removed from his room.”  He was declared dead at .pm. The inquest heard he died of heart failure brought on by lung disease. Dr Thomas said Brady was a paranoid schizophrenic with an underlying “narcissistic and “anti-social” personality disorder, adding: “He was also thought to suffer from a number of deviant sexual ­disorders, to include sadism and paedophilia.” Brady would not engage with psychiatrists or take anti-psychotic drugs. He would verbally abuse staff and demand a move to a mainstream prison, but was refused.  Dr Thomas also dismissed Brady’s -year “hunger strike”. He said the prisoner was fed by a nasogastric tube up his nose but also took solid food and drinks. The doctor added: “Clinical teams regularly sought to bring an end to his reported ‘hunger strike’, recognising he was regularly accepting diet and fluids, alongside or substituted for his NG feed.

Le ed to normal but, ­tragically, it would not stay that way. The battling ten-year-old, who has twice successful fought cancer, has the disease once again. This time the odds are heavily stacked against him. Doctors here give him just a ten per cent chance of living more than five years. But his parents are determined to fight on and are pinning their hopes on pioneering drug trials. They are trying to raise £, to get Callum treatment in the US that is not available on the NHS. Callum’s mum Nicola, , said: “Seeing my son fight this disease for seven years has been heartbreaking but he has ­never given up. “He’s fought it and beaten it twice and I know he can do it again. We must give him that chance. I am not losing my boy.” Callum, of Leigh, Gtr Manchester, was just three when he began getting ­symptoms. Nicola first took Callum to his GP with stomach pains. In June , after he’d turned four, he was ­diagnosed with an ­aggressive stage- neuroblastoma. She said: “It was such a shock when they told us, the last thing we ­expected. It was a body blow. “I was heartbroken but I had to carry on and be strong for Callum. “We told him he had a lump in his tummy and was having medicine for it. He was a little hero and never complained.” Callum had an operation to remove a tumour in his stomach and gruelling chemotherapy, immunotherapy and stem cell treatment. He lost his hair, endured sickness, lethargy, high temperatures and spent months in hospital. Then, in December , the family got the news they were hoping for when his scans came back all clear.  Nicola recalled: “We were over the moon. Le slowly went back to ­normal and we started going on family caravan holidays again.” But just over two years later, in January , when Callum was getting ready for school he complained of feeling unwell. Nicola noticed a lump on his neck. An ­emergency scan at the hospital confirmed the cancer had ed. Nicola said: “To get that news a second time was devastating. It could easily have ­broken us, but we had to fight on.” Callum had three types of chemo and after  months in and out of hospital he had kicked the ­cancer again. But in August last year there was a lump on his neck and Nicola knew what to expect. The ­cancer had spread to the right side of his stomach. She said: “I’d thought after his treatment had finished the second time we were going to go back to normal. “Being told again and again your boy has cancer is awful.”  Since then a tumour on Callum’s chest has been surgically removed and, days before his tenth ­birthday, another growing on his spine, which could have paralysed him, was taken out. He has been through more chemo and radiotherapy, been rushed into intensive care with complications four times. He spent his Christmas at Great Ormond Street hospital in London. Nicola said: “Callum is the definition of a fighter. I know he can beat this again and beat it for good.” "},{"url":null,"title":"lotto results live winning numbers","story":"NewsLotto results LIVE: Winning numbers for Saturdays National Lottery £million jackpotThe winning numbers for tonights National Lottery Lotto draw, including the Thunderball, will be published here laterShareByBradley JollyOnline journalistUpdated:,  MAR NewsA National Lottery ticket like this could change your le forever \" data-chronos-request-url\"https:livecentreps-fargate-prod.tm-awx v live-centre nationals-live \" data-embedded-url-endpoint\"https:www.mirror news uk-news lotto-results-live-winning-numbers- serviceresponsiveembeddedArticleUrl\" data-chronos-domain\"https:livecentreps-fargate-prod.tm-awx \" data-inview\"true\" Tonightaposs Lotto jackpot from the National Lottery is a rollover so it has reached £million.If youaposre the lucky ticket holder, then it could be a summer to remember forever.

Ambulance bosses have released the  call which captured the dramatic moment -year-old Jack Thompson collapsed outside his school gates. An onlooker immediately called  while Nova Charles, an off-duty nurse and Pete Watson, a GP leaped into action. The caller can be heard calmly telling the operator: It looks like heaposs having an epileptic fit...his school friends donapost knowheaposs epileptic...he doesnapost actually look good. Weaposve got a lady here who has got NHS clothing on. I think sheaposs just a mum. Weaposre starting resuscitation. Heaposs kind of semi-conscious and kind of taking breaths but kind of out of it at the same time. Nova performed six rounds of CPR and did mouth-to-mouth as she tried to save Jackaposs le on September . At the time school pal Keiron Stanley, , ran to collect a local defibrillator from the school and brought it to where Jack lay unconscious for Dr Watson to use. East Midlands Ambulance service technician Marcus Bryan and emergency care assistant Gemma Woolley arrived at the school - The Priory Belvoir Academy in Bottesford, along with a crew from the Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire Air Ambulance. Eventually Jack stopped having fits and was transported to Nottinghamaposs Queenaposs Medical Centre where he was later diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a heart condition affecting the walls of the heart chambers, meaning they become stretched, thickened, or go stf. He has since had an ICD unit fitted into his heart which regulates irregular heart rhythms and can administer tiny shocks without Jack being aware that it is happening. Jack, from Bottesford, who is now , said: “What has happened to me really hasn’t phased me. I’m just really excited to meet everyone who saved my le.” Dr Pete Watson said the defib alongside CPR were the key elements which gave Jack a chance of survival. He said: We administered a shock and we managed to get a heart rhythm back.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum 33 just one month","story":"NewsMum, , has just one month to live after she complained of stomach painsTara Mason faces having to say goodbye to children Tia, , and Kacey, , after being diagnosed with cancer in her lungs, bowel and liver.

The beauty business boss is allowed to stay on the road despite having  points on her licence. Georgia Elisabeth Carney, , was stung by speed cameras multiple times on the M near Warrington, Cheshire, between junctions  and , where the speed limit had changed from mph to mph. In the space of two months last summer, she was caught travelling in excess of the mph limit  times - twice at mph.At Manchester Magistratesapos Court, Carney - who puts on beauty courses at salons - said a driving ban would cause her exceptional hardship because she wouldnapost be able to carry all her gear on public transport, reports the Manchester Evening News. Carney, from Widnes in Cheshire, also claimed her mum would suffershe was banned from the road as she is the named guarantor on her rented flat - and the named contact in relation to her leased Audi. Magistrates accepted her aposspecial reasonsapos argument. Carney was hit with a £, fine and ordered to pay £ court costs. She was allowed to keep her licence, despite amassing  points - three per incident - for the offences. Carney already had six points. Defending Carney, lawyer Nicky Johnson told the court many other drivers were caught speeding on the same stretch between June and August .  “I understand this might cause some alarm considering the large number of offences in a two month period, and this may raise concern in the face of repeat offending with no regard for the restrictions in place,” Mrs Johnson said. “In the face of it, she wasn’t aware of the fact she had fully flouted the speed limit because of a delay in her receiving the summons. “The reason for that is because the vehicle she was driving in all of these offences is a leased vehicle, which she has been the registered keeper for, for a period of two years. “All the summonses were sent to the lease company and not directed to her in the first instance. That caused a delay.  “Regrettably, after further enquiries at Audi, they received a number of summonses and sent them back to the relevant road traffic unit, who then sent it to her mother’s address.” The court heard the bulk of the summonses arrived at the same time. Carney was not aware any offences had been committed. Carney was said to be ‘absolutely horried’ when she started receiving court letters. Mrs Johnson said: “Since the offences occurred, she was offered by one of the summons to take part in a road traffic speed awareness course, and she completed that in December last year. “She was proactive. “The majority of the speeds are under mph, had the speed limit been in place, it would have been fine. “Some are over mph, two of which are mph, which is mph over. “She accepts these occasions were when she was in a rush to get home from work and she apologises for that.”The self-employed beauty and nail technician puts on training courses across Greater Manchester and Cheshire. She argued her business would be affectedshe was banned from driving.The court heard Carney also travels to clientsapos houses. Carney claimed she would not be able to ‘fulfil her working obligations’ without acar.Mrs Johnson added: “She would not be able to rely on public transport because of the places she is working and travelling to and from. “It will be very dficult practically to transport the amount of equipment she has with her, which are essentially the tools of her trade.

First he cheated on his fiancée Charlotte Clark – the mum of his baby daughter – with her sister. Then he went on to marry the sister, Rebecca, and have five children with her. But Charlotte has buried the hatchet for the sake of their daughter Serena, now , and even went to the pair’s wedding. “Finding out the man I loved, the father of my child, had been sleeping with my sister almost broke me,” she said. “It took a very long time to forgive them but I did it for the sake of my daughter. “Now we are like one big family. We have Christmases together and spend days at the beach.” Charlotte, now , first met Garry, , when he was a chef at a pub where her best friend worked in . Garry already had two kids from a previous relationship. Charlotte, an apprentice assessor originally from Redhill, Surrey, recalled: “Garry was a lot older but I was attracted to his humour. He was very funny and we bounced off each other.” In  Charlotte gave birth to Serena and they got engaged in Croydon, South London. She said: “He was a great dad, we were happy. I thought we’d be together forever.” But Charlotte invited her younger sister Rebecca to spend more time at their home because she was going through a dficult time at work. Ironically, at that point Rebecca hated Garry. “Her and my mum didn’t think he was there enough when I was pregnant and they didn’t agree with the age dference,” Charlotte said. “Rebecca would come over and they’d barely say a word to each other. It was awkward, I just wanted them to get along.” Then, one night in , Charlotte asked Garry to drive her sister home – and he didn’t come back for four hours. “When I asked him where he’d been, he said they’d just been talking,” said Charlotte.  “Initially, I was pleased they had started to get on but, as the weeks went on, Rebecca and Garry became thick as thieves. “Then one day, I got home from work and found her in my house. She’d come to see Garry while I was out. I went mad and told Garry it had to stop. “When it carried on, I confronted them but they swore nothing was going on between them.”Finally, in , Charlotte found Facebook messages between the pair saying: “We need to tell Charlotte we’re in love, how do we tell her ”She recalled: “I knew something wasn’t right but I didn’t expect that. I was shaking, crying, heartbroken. “I confronted Garry and he admitted everything. They’d been sleeping together for weeks. I couldn’t bear to look at Rebecca. I’d invited her into my home and this is how she repaid me. I worried I would hit herI saw her.” Charlotte moved out with her daughter and less than a month later found out that her sister was pregnant.  “I remember thinking, ‘This must have happened while they were cheating on me,’ said Charlotte. “The pain was awful. “I didn’t want to see either of them but I had to maintain a relationship with Garry for the sake of our daughter.” Charlotte made up with Rebecca when she learned she was having problems with the pregnancy. “We talked for the first time since she broke my heart,” Charlotte said. “I saw her and related to her as one mum to another. When you’re pregnant, all you can think is, ‘I would dieanything happened to my baby’. Since then she has completely forgiven the pair – even attending their wedding at Godstone church in Surrey in . She said: “I did wonder in the weeks leading up to the ceremony, whether I could be there.  “But my daughter is sister to Garry and Rebecca’s kids. They are close and, despite everything, Garry is a good dad. “On the day, I didn’t feel any jealousy. I don’t feel anything towards Garry anymore. It hurt when Rebecca got pregnant with her first child but I got used to it and soon it was just, ‘What  Another one ’” Rebecca and Garry now have Emma, seven, Zach, six, Hannah, five, Isla, three, and Ava, one. Now Charlotte, Rebecca, Garry and their brood are like one big family and see each almost every day. When Charlotte went to live in Port Talbot in South Wales, Rebecca and Garry moved to be close to her and Serena shortly after. Charlotte explained: “It works well. I still do things with my sister, we go shopping together or we will sometimes go out without the kids. Serena is very close to her siblings. She says they drive her mad, but she loves them really.  “She is too young to understand the full family dynamic. She knows mummy was with daddy, then they split up and he’s married to her auntie.” Serena is sister to her dad’s kids with Rebecca but also their cousin. Garry is her dad but also technically her uncle. Charlotte added: “I have moved on. I’m happily single and, unless someone really special comes along, I’ll stay that way. It was hard for me to trust anyone after what happened.” Rebecca, , a community support worker, said: “I hated Garry when he was with Charlotte but, once we started to talk, we just clicked.

As third and fourth in line to the throne, the Cambridge kids are very dferent to their friends - but according to other parents at their school theyaposre just like everyone  as soon as that bell rings. Both kids attend Thomasaposs Battersea, with George in Year  and Charlotte starting in Reception last September. Despite the initial excitement, Kate, William, George and Charlotte are apparently now just treated like everyone  at the school, and nobody gives them a second glance. But that means George and Charlotte are reportedly not allowed to have best friend, just like the rest of the kids, in line with the schoolaposs rules. Speaking about the school on Loose Women, journalist Jane Moore explained why Charlotte wonapost be allowed to have a aposbest friendapos at the school. She said: Itaposs a really great little school actually for the reasons I think that it really focuses on kindness, itaposs a really big thing in that school and the pastoral care is amazing. Thereaposs a policy thatyour child is having a party, unless every child in the class is invited you don’t give out the invites in class, which I think is quite a good thing as you don’t feel excluded.  There are signs everywhere saying be kind, that’s the ethos of the school. They don’t encourage you to have best friends. Thomasaposs offered a wide and ied curriculum , focusing on seven key areas of learning - Personal, social and emotional development, Communication and Language, Physical development, Literacy, Maths, Understanding the world and art and design. The schoolaposs website states: We believe that the Early Years Foundation Stage is fundamental in instilling positive dispositions towards learning.

Picking up on the left of the penalty area, he squared up Paul Watson but could only swerve his effort wide four minutes before the interval.Just a minute later, United looked in as Shankland stood up a ball for McMullan to attack in the six-yard box but Daniel Harvie was able to get back in and clear off the line with Doohan stranded.Harkes was at the centre of what United did well in the opening moments of the second period, forcing a corner with his deep cross and making a late run into the box in an attempt to race onto Bingham#s through ball.On  minutes, Dillon Powers, useful at set-plays all night, found Mark Connolly at the back post with a deep free-kick but the Irishman#s header across the box had no takers.Just after the hour-mark, Kelly fired a dipping free-kick over the bar for the hosts # their first chance of the half.On  minutes, Sam Roscoe acrobatically hooked a half volley over the bar as Ayr grew into proceedings once more.Harkes was again clear for United as the goal opened up for him moments later. Played in by McMullan on the left of the box, the American could only slash wide with just Doohan to beat.Entering the final quarter of the game, United were still struggling to break down a rigid Ayr defence.Haring through surrounded by a glut of white shirts, Shankland perhaps should have slipped in a freer Peter Pawlett, only just off the bench, but elected to go it alone and was crowded out.Boss Robbie Neilson erred on the side off caution by replacing McMullan with Robson on  minutes after the winger went down with cramp.Drinan smashed an effort wide for the home side two minutes later, before Jordan Houston tested Siegrist with a header.Drinan again powered a drive just over the United crossbar with nine minutes remaining before Harvie fizzed an effort wide.In the final minute, Drinan could only drag a shot across the ground and straight into the grateful arms of Siegrist as third-placed Ayr went for the kill.The Tangerines, too, pushed for a late winner late on but it never came as they enter the final round of fixtures still out in front.Ayr United XI : DoohanHouston, Bell , Roscoe, Harvie Kerr , Muirhead McCowan , Kelly, ForrestDrinan.Subs not used: Hare-Reid , Smith, Gillespie and Murphy.Dundee United XI : SiegristSmith, Watson, Connolly, ReynoldsMcMullan , Powers, Harkes, Appere Bingham , Shankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sporle, Glass, Freeman and Neilson.Referee: David Munro.Att: , ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.51260732-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.51260732-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.51260732-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.51260732-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"broughty ferry health centre closing for a week due to coronavirus","story":"Broughty Ferry Health Centre has closed with immediate effect until next week after several patients reportedly tested positive for coronavirus.In a statement published this evening, NHS Tayside said the measure was being taken as a precaution, and stressed that the risk to other patients and workers at the centre was low.The Brown Street centre will continue to take phone calls from patients, and will ert locals who need GP appointments to other surgeries or to telephone consultations.It will reopen on Thursday at the earliest.

say thanks to charity with kiltwalk","story":"An Aberdeen woman is limbering up to take part in the Kiltwalk to raise money for a charity that supports her daughter.Pat Stanley, , from Cove, will be taking on the -mile Big Stroll at the Aberdeen event to raise cash for Archway.The parent-led local charity, based in the city, provides care and support to children and adults with learning disabilities.Now entering its th year, Archway is celebrating its pearl anniversary and Pat has pledged her support for an organisation that has helped her daughter for  years.The Big Stroll marks the first of many feats for Pat, who aims to complete a range of challenges in the run-up to her th birthday next year.She said: “I’m trying to challenge myself but, more importantly, it’s to raise funds for Archway because they look after our daughter.”Her daughter, Beth Stanley, will be  this year – making her the same age as Archway.Since she was young, she has received help to allow her to live a more independent le.Pat said: “Archway has supported us with respite care from when she was nine and a few years ago she started using the shared care facilities, which meant she was with them for a month and then home for a month.”Last year the opportunity arose for Beth to go into permanent care and in June she moved into the charity care unit at Berryden Mills, with Pat saying she has “taken to it like a duck to water”.She said: “She’s more confident, she’s more independent, we get some sleep, it’s a win-win.”The Archway Pearls will take on the Kiltwalk on Sunday June , with the funds raised being used to build another permanent care unit in Aberdeen.Pat said: “We opened our newest one last year, in June.“We managed to purchase and convert a bungalow in St Margaret’s Place to make it suitable for ladies and we need to do more because all of our little people at special school get bigger and need somewhere.”With the support from the sidelines of her husband David Stanley, , she says she is more than ready to put her best foot forward for Kiltwalk.Kiltwalk ensures % of all funds raised go directly to the charity of the iniduals’ choosing.The % top-up applied this year by the Hunter Foundation means charities have a helping hand in smashing their targets.Pat is urging iniduals and companies without a particular cause in mind to don a kilt too and walk in aid of Archway.She said: “It’s a big year and we certainly encourage anyone who wants to come along and do the Kiltwalk and support us, because we are quite a small charity.“It was set up by Aberdeen parents when there was nothing, and we need your support.”Paul Cooney, Kiltwalk CEO, said “We’re really pleased that she’s taking part in Kiltwalk. It’s a great example to everyone that you can make a huge impact through Kiltwalk no matter what age you are or what distance you are going, whether it’s the Mighty Stride the Big Stroll or the Wee Wander.“She’s an inspiration to others and I look forward to seeing her on June .”The charity event, which has been held since , sees thousands of people put on a kilt in aid of their favourite cause. With locations across Aberdeen, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee, many choose to take on one walk or a “grand slam” of all four.Aberdeen Kiltwalk takes place on Sunday June , with the ultimate challenge of the -mile Mighty Stride beginning at am from Potarch Green. The Big Stroll is  miles between Crathes Castle and Duthie Park and those walking the Wee Wander will begin at noon and cover a distance of five miles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.49926551-1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.49926551-1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.49926551-1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.49926551-1-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"aberdeen sporting festival returns","story":"Thousands of pupils from across Aberdeen will have the opportunity to take part in physical activity as a sporting festival s.The Aberdeen Youth Games is a city-wide initiative developed by Sport Aberdeen’s Active Schools team, Robert Gordon Universityand the North East Scotland College .More than  student coaches will deliver activities in primary schools, culminating in the Festival of Health at the Aberdeen Sports Village on May , with last year’s event drawing record numbers.Graeme Dale, Sport Aberdeen’s head of sport and active communities, said: “The initiative has become a hugely anticipated and enjoyable event in Aberdeen’s sporting calendar and it underlines the importance of keeping young people active in a fun environment while giving students invaluable experience.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.49926551-1-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.49926551-1-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.49926551-1-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/03/2.49926551-1-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"car dealer helps to rev up north east charity total","story":"A car dealership has made a £, donation to children’s charity Charlie House.Peter Vardy, which has dealerships in Wellington Road and Lang Stracht, made the six-figure donation as part of its One Child Programme.Last year, the Peter Vardy Foundation made a donation to the programme for every car sold or serviced by the Aberdeen sites, and customers were given the opportunity to match the donation.Charlie House supports babies, children and young people with complex disabilities and le-limiting conditions and their families across the north-east.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance.

along with ambitious plans to secure funding to create a museum, which will house artefacts and photographs.But the engine-ious plan to honour Peeblesrsquo historic railway isnrsquot the only train of thought exercising the minds of these trainspotters.Following the closure of the Tourist Information Centre on Peebles High Street, members of the group hope to include information for visitors to the town.The Peebles Railway Heritage Group, which has been formed by members of the Peebles Community Trust, seeks to refurbish the building and bring it back into community use.Chairman of Peebles Community Council Les Turnbull, told the Peeblesshire News: ldquoThe group officially took over the tenancy on the first of March for a peppercorn rent and received the keys officially from leader of the council, Shona Haslam.ldquoOne of the main priorities is to obtain funding to secure and repair the exterior of the building as a listed building and standing in the conservation area, the group seeks toit to its original state to preserve its unique status as the only original railway building in this area.Though not widely known, Peebles had three railway stations at one time and indeed owes much of its development to the part railways played in bringing visitors to the town as well as the transport of goods and materials.It is this story that the PRHG wants to capture for posterity and share with residents and visitors.Mr Turnbull continued: ldquoHaving lost our tourist information office there is also a gap in the provision of information for visitors.\"Because this office sits in what is considered to be the main car park for the town there is an opportunity to use the facility to provide much needed information on local attractions and activities.The PRHG intend seeking funds to refurbish the interior of the building to make it a modern and attractive place to visit using modern techniques such as video and computer technology to bring the building back to le.ldquoThis a unique project to protect and preserve an iconic building that is deteriorating, said Mr Turnbull.ldquoI am optimistic that we can raise the funds to make this building a valuable educational tool for our young people, and others, who have no knowledge of our railway heritage. It will also benefit the economic wellbeing of the townwe can fill some of the gap left by the closure of our tourist information

member for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale has resorted to Freedom of Information requests in a bid to get answers.A row erupted last month between the Conservative-led administration at Scottish Borders Council and the SNP government at Holyrood over funding for a replacement school.Claims by council leader Shona Haslam and education portfolio holder Carol Hamilton that the Scottish Government had rejected a plea for help was angrily refuted by both Ms Grahame and the Cabinet Secretary for Education, John Swinney.It emerged that no formal request for financial assistance had been made to the Scottish Government ahead of the claims being made.And it was several days later that Councillor Haslam eventually sent a letter - not in her role as council leader but as a ward councillor for Tweeddale East.Details of funding for a replacement Peebles High have remained sketchy with pound million being required to plug the gap between an expected pound million insurance pay out and the estimated demolition and rebuild costs of around pound million.Over the past few weeks Christine Grahames attempts for further clarication over funding from the council leader has been met with the cold shoulder.Ms Grahame told us: \"I have asked a number of follow-up questions to establish how plans for Peebles High would be progressing, however Councillor Haslam has now responded to say that she is not prepared to answer my questions.\"At the heart of this is the question of getting a proper replacement for Peebles High School that serves the school community properly.\"The issue should never have been made party political and I remain hugely frustrated that Councillor Haslam decided to issue a press release attacking the Scottish Government on February , apparently before any request was even made.\"How does trying to score cheap points against the SNP with a factually inaccurate press release serve the school community or indeed foster a co-operative approach between the council and the government \"It is behaviour that, frankly, should be beneath a council leader.\"Although Scottish Borders Council claim their decision to impose a record hike in council tax from next month is to help fund a new replacement school in Peebles, it is expected that money will still be required from Holyrood.But government officials have yet to receive any request from Newtown St Boswells.Ms Grahame added: \"As Irsquom sure Councillor Haslam well knows, her letter of February , issued after she claimed the Scottish Government had refused funding, does not constitute a formal funding request, given the lack of any details.\"And I remain unclear why shersquos written as a local ward councillor rather than in her role as leader of Scottish Borders Council.\"I have yet to see any correspondence that shows any formal request to the Scottish Government, let alone anything that constitutes it refusing funding, and Councillor Haslam is now refusing to share any further information.\"It is her complete refusal to engage with me on this matter which has led me to put in a formal FOI request to try to get to the bottom of whatrsquos actually going on.\"This is causing a huge deal of concern in the school community and I, like them, simply want to know what is actually being done to support replacing the school, all politics aside.We did put all the points raised by Ms Grahame to Councillor Haslam.She told us: \"Public consultations are ongoing with parents and users of the school and we will be taking these plans forward with the Scottish Government in a constructive manner."},{"url":null,"title":"a72-closed-nine-days-near-peebles","story":"MOTORISTS on the A are facing major disruption and y ersions from Monday.Daytime closures are set to take place

Four years later, she married her half-cousin, Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley, and in June  they had a son, James.In , her second husband was murdered.

She sought the help of Queen Elizabeth I of England, but Elizabeth thought she was a threat to her own throne and she imprisoned Mary in a series of English castles and manor houses.In , after more than nineteen years in custody, Mary was beheaded for plotting to assassinate Elizabeth.What will you see The house sits in attractive gardens which are home to some of Jedburghrsquos famous pear trees, descendants of the original pear trees planted around Jedburgh Abbey in the early s.Inside the towerhouse, a display of paintings, artefacts, and textiles associated with Mary explores not only her le and times, but the cult that has grown up around her.The period feel inside the house has been preserved with thoughtful design, which allows the story of Maryrsquos le to be told in an engaging way.The Rogues Gallery introduces the iniduals in the drama of Maryrsquos le, while the Last Letter Room reveals her final thoughts before her execution.VisitingThe museum is situated on Queen Street, near Canongate car park, where parking is free.

Keith Mitchell picked up the ball on the left and released McFadyen down the left flank, from where he produced a fine low cross which substitute Donald McCallum struck low into the Neilston net with his left foot to make it -.But with some  minutes to play and the Pupils cruising, Neilston halved the deficit, a visiting striker gambling on Ferguson’s kick, and blocking it, the resulting break of the ball landing in his path for an easy finish, providing a leline to the men from East Renfrewshire.But their hopes of an equaliser would quickly fade, after a Neilston player-coach – already booked on the touchline for dissent ­– was sent off for a foul on Mitchell within a minute of entering the field of play.The same player then proceeded to throw a running punch as he left the field, before both teams became embroiled in an on-pitch melee.After the fisticuffs fizzled out, the game of football resumed and a healthy Kintyre Park crowd watched a settled final  minutes of action as the Pupils did enough to seal a welcome three points, over the team they had beaten on the road in front of the BBC Scotland cameras a month previously.Finally, midfielder Ryan Gilchrist, enjoying a regularto first-team action, was given the man-of-the-match award, with the creative energy of McFadyen another highlight for the Pupils.Tomorrowthe Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils travel to Busby on league duty, with kick-off at pm.

Aside from the occasional draught which we could dodge by retreating to the back room, it was wonderfully toasty. This was in large part thanks to generous neighbours above and below whose central heating kept us permanently cocooned.In the country, as I quickly learned, in winter there are two main subjects of conversation: weather and warmth, but the greater of these is warmth. Hoolet, like many villages around here, has no gas supply, so central heating runs either by electricity or oil. The topic of electricity bills leads to much sucking in of breath, although there was one couple whose house somehow escaped the notice of the electricity board.Only when they sold up and the new owners found they werenrsquot being charged did it become clear why there had always been such a blazing array of Christmas lights in this particular garden. Rumour has it that, years earlier, a woman in this area greased a palm and had her meter erted to a lamp-post. It took a while before the extraordinarily high reading was finally noticed and an investigation began. Soon she was tracked down, along with her cannabis plants.The day is approaching when wersquoll all have to switch to renewables, but in the meantime our radiators drink oil. Every few days I check the gauge on the tank in the garden, half-closing my eyes as I pull out the pin and watch it drop one inch, then two. Since it can take over a week between ordering and getting a refill, you have to estimate how long it will last. If nothing , becoming aware of every drop of oil you use does mean that, while itrsquos the least environmentally friendly of fuels, it is never squandered. One friend is so thrty her grandchildren have renamed her house The Baltic.Long before, and after, they became fashionable, everyone around here wears a gilet. People only come to their doors in a tee-shirttheyrsquove been interrupted in the process of layering. I was watching a western the other night and saw a tobacco-spitting rancher on his porch, rle under his stained armpit. What caught my attention was his long-johns, the sort that reach from ankle to chin to wrist, with buttons down the front. Theyrsquore exactly what I need.Other than the relief of seeing the orange lights of the oil tanker arriving in the pitch black of a winterrsquos morning, there is nothing interesting about oil. Our other source of heat, however, is wood-burning stoves, and on this subject I could win Mastermind. We have two, which possibly saved my husbandrsquos le. When the Beast From the East descended on Hoolet, he was left with a gaping hole in the kitchen wall where the boiler had been taken out moments before the blizzard started. The heating engineers fled to get over Soutra Hill before they were snowed in, and his ordeal began: two log fires and two hot water bottles to get him through five days until the roads reopened. When he went into the kitchen to cook dinner, he had to wear hat and gloves as well as his puffa jacket.There is nothing more comforting in the cold than a roaring fire. In rural parts this is not a lestyle choice but an absolute necessity. Of an evening we get through about five logs, which is enough to keep a large room really cosy. When we started out, we were so ignorant wersquod never even heard the phrase ldquokiln dried and ndash Irsquom going beetroot just thinking about it ndash we bought logs in bags from BQ. Now, having found a good supplier, and with our own woodstore, the first thing we notice as we drive around the area is other peoplersquos woodpiles.Some are works of art, high as a gable end and stacked so expertly theyrsquore as solid as drystane dykes. A few keep them in a ramshackle heap, out in the open, where they soak up the rain. Quite apart from the level of emissions wet wood produces, which is why itrsquos high on the governmentrsquos hit-list, it is far less efficient, generating less warmth and more smoke. Butyoursquore patient, green wood dries out ndash Irsquove heard you should wait two years for anything yoursquove cut down yourself. My father would have scoffed at that, as hersquod bring the car to a sudden halt, nip out and drag a huge storm-tossed branch into the boot ndash ldquotidying up the countryside as he put it. Back home, he stoked the flames so high we had to push the furniture back against the walls and open the living room door.The other day we had a delivery of ash, dumped in front of the house in a crate big enough to hold a wild boar. As the lumberjack was in bed barking like a sea-lion, it fell to me to deal with it.

It could be that the disruption caused by the coronavirus will turn out to be a relative blip and le willto normal, including regular travel abroad. Soon enough, the crowds could be back.It is not guaranteed, though. Travel, even at the best of times, is becoming more trouble than it is worth. Holidays abroad are increasingly spent recovering from the trip there and steeling oneself for the journey back. Hell is the modern airport.Given this, and increased awareness of climate change, more people will want to holiday close to home. Those who come from further afield will expect as eco-friendly a holiday as possible once they get here.Scotland is ideally placed to do well out of these changes. Or it would bewe had a transport system that was not a national embarrassment.The latest snafu is the cancellation of sailings between Brodick and Ardrossan. This is the busiest route in the CalMac network, serving , passengers. It is a flagship service in every sense, essential to Arran residents, businesses, and the wider tourist industry.There cannot be many Scots families who have not spent holidays on Arran. It is a fantastic island, the kind of place most countries would love to have a ferry ride away. The tourist board punts it as ldquoScotland in miniature but a better tag might be ldquoLike Vancouver Island, but closer.: Further ferry delays fearedNot only do Scots make good use of it, we recommend it, and indeed the rest of Scotland, wherever we go in the world. Yoursquoll have a great time, we tell people. To that we should add ldquoas long as you go at the right time.As far as travelling to Arran goes, now is not the best of times. It emerged this week that due to a fault with the mooring equipment ships can no longer berth safely in bad weather. According to CalMac the repairs could take up to six weeks, which runs right into the peak Easter holiday period.Why will it take so long  Because CalMac needs to source spare parts. If the parts were so essential one might imagine they would be held in stock, but that is to assume a level of efficiency that is proving beyond the service operators and their ultimate bosses, the Scottish Government.The latest problems take place against the backdrop of spiralling costs and y delays in the delivery of two new ferries. Vessels that should have cost pound million are now priced at more than double that, and they will not be in operation till  at least.Gavin Fulton, chair of Arran Ferry Action Group, has described the situation as ldquoa shambles. He told The Heraldrsquos reporter Martin Williams that patients on the island were having to spend up to five days on the mainland just to get to a hospital appointment and back.ldquoThings are going from bad to worse for us and there is no contingency plan, he added. ldquoThere is no word of chartering a boat, or to buy one abroad. It is a case of waiting  months for a new ferry and we have to put up with it.Mr Fulton is not alone in his despair. Another essential route, at the Rest and Be Thankful, is prone to closure due to landslips, forcing drivers on a -mile detour. It was announced recently that more millions are to be spent on repairs rather than a reroute of the A. Iain Jurgensen of the Argyll and The Isles Tourism Co-operative said it was ldquostaggering and irresponsible to keep spending public money on patching the problem rather than sorting it out once and for all.: Anger as services haltedIt is not just rural areas that are suffering from the lack of a joined up transport system in Scotland. Rail travel between two of the countryrsquos biggest cities is expensive, unreliable and overcrowded. Bus services across the country y wildly in price and efficiency. In Glasgow the subway does not operate on a Sunday evening. Too often the only way to ensure getting somewhere on time is to go by car, and even then good luck with the potholes.Of course there have been successes, chief among them the Queensferry Crossing. Leaving aside recent closures due to snow and ice the bridge was delivered with only a slight delay, again due to weather, and under budget, something of a miracle for large projects.Yet the Queensferry Crossing aside, Scotlandrsquos transport is too often in reverse or going nowhere fast.Part of the problem is that the subject has become politicised, alongside much  in Scottish le. Take the recent Queensferry Crossing closures. Instead of having a rational discussion about them, the row became another proxy war over Scottish independence. Criticising Scotlandrsquos transport, like questioning educational attainment or NHS waiting times, is seen as ldquotalking Scotland down.It would be funnyit was not so ridiculous. When you travel to another country you donrsquot give two toots of a horn who built what road and when, or who runs the ferry service.: Time to end monopoly of ownershipAll the traveller wants is a reliable service that will take them where they want to go at a reasonable cost both to themselves and the planet. That is what Scots desire as well, and it is not too much to ask.Transport is such an obvious building block for any successful country it should be above political bickering. Even given the problems of geography, it should not be beyond our ability to build a national transport infrastructure that works for all the people most of the time.Since nothing broadens the mind on transport like using the system, herersquos a suggestion. If more of our MPs and MSPs were to venture outside the Central Belt they could see the problems for themselves. Perhaps, once this latest spell of disruption is over, some of them could try commuting from Arran for a spell, or venture beyond the Rest and Be Thankful.Donrsquot forget to send us a postcardand when you arrive."},{"url":null,"title":"BUDGET SKETCH  Chancellor finds forest of magic money trees  Watch out  Boris ","story":"Mr Sunak, when seen on his own, looks a regular sized Chancellor. But put him beside someone of average height and build and he appears tiny. Like Stuart Little tiny. You see it when he walks up Downing Street beside another Minister, orhe is being interviewed one to one and the director cuts to a wide shot. On Sky News at the weekend he made the normally petite presenter Sophy Ridge look like the  foot woman, about to attack.Delivering his first Budget yesterday he seemed perfectly at ease. He looked taller, too. Perhaps he had been given a box to stand on, or maybe that is the sort of confidence a bespoke suit gives a chap.Mr Sunak has not been in the job long, having come to the position after the previous incumbent jumped ship in protest at Number rsquos proposed takeover of the Treasury. Dominic Cummings, the PMrsquos chief aide, was all for installing Larry the cat as Chancellor. In the end, Mr Sunak got the job.Among his tasks yesterday was to show that he was a man, not a mouser, and his own man at that. Before he could get to the juicy part of the Budget, handing out the ribbon-wrapped goodies to all his new pals on the Tory backbenches, he addressed the coronavirus crisis.The Commons heard that one fth of the working age population might need to take time off work . That is a lot of people sitting at home watching Phil and Holly on This Morning.Now, you may have been under the impression these last ten years that the UKrsquos finances amounted to whatever spare change could be found down the back of the sofa in  Downing Street. Money was tight, and it was vital to balance the books, so austerity ruled, spending was slashed, and those on benefits had to be squeezed till their pips squeaked. No one wanted to do this, you understand, but as a former PM said, there was no such thing as a magic money tree.Well, it turns out Mr Sunak has discovered a forest of magic money trees. He shook this one, then that one, showering cash left, right and centre. Speaking of left and right, Mr Sunak decided he was going to merge all three positions into one and make Labour redundant. It was the Conservatives, he said, who were ldquothe real workersrsquo party and ldquothe party of public services. Just to further annoy comrade Corbyn he boasted, Blair-like, of delivering ldquoa peoplersquos Budget.The closest the Chancellor came to a half way decent gag was when he abolished VAT on digital books, including ldquoworks of fantasy like John McDonnellrsquos Economics for the Many. Sitting opposite, the man who would have been Chancellor had Labour miraculously won the election, laughed and felt in his pocket ashe was going to reprise his Maorsquos Little Red Book joke of five years ago. A rubbish joke then, age had not improved it.The Chancellorrsquos main rf, one that he ed to again and again, was that the Conservatives were ldquogetting it done. It was the bossrsquos line about Brexit, or was it Cummings who had coined it  Either way, the Chancellor said it so often and with such relish it was ashe had adopted it for his own.

As John Donne almost said, ldquoNo man is an island. And he needs someone to go to the Grosvenor with on a Saturday night with.But itrsquos not easy. As well as the lack of opportunity to meet people, you have to battle against your own torpidity. After a while youget used to your own routine.Then therersquos the fussiness you develop over the years. I once went on a blind date and discovered the meeting to be utterly pointless the moment I noted the femalersquos shoesndash worn for a lunchtime coffee. Therersquos another issue with being single and ageing. The passing years offer experience, a knowing of what you need in a partner, and this knowledge can be inhibiting. Realising you want someone who is intelligent, challenging and fun ndash but also someone who is serious, thoughtful and kind is a heavy boulder to shove. Realising blondes certainly assert themselves on the eye , and that yoursquore a sucker for high cheekbones and a cheeky glint is daunting.Yes, Irsquom asking a lot. And to add to that list I just donrsquot feel comfortable with women bigger than me. So, prospective partners have to be able to limbo under a size  bar.There are notes of optimism, however, to bring to this rather cynical partner quest. Having mutually split with my long-term partner , Irsquove since learned where I truly went wrong:yoursquore going to be with someone for a very long time you should assume they would love to be married. Eventhey never offer the slightest indication of such.Can I commit  Irsquod like to think so. So where to begin with this search to find a we Itrsquos been claimed that more than  per cent of marriages begin online these days, according to figures supplied by the Statistic Brain Research Institute. Thatrsquos good, isnrsquot it Well, Irsquom not so sure. It all seems like HMDI cable connection love. I prefer some form of personal interest to predicate the meeting. I quite liked the high school ldquoMy pal fancies your pal arranged dating, and I thought the premise of the early lonelyhearts agencies to be absolutely sound.My education into this world began in the Kelburne Cinema in  when I watched Carry On Loving. I liked this world. All you had to do was wander into the Wedded Bliss dating agency, the little high street love shop run by Sid Blissand thebig-hearted Sophie Plummett , who would flick through a box of cards and pick out someone whorsquos exactly your type.I recall at  wonderingSophie could pick out someone for me.Fty years on, Irsquom wondering exactly the same thing, except that the personal finger of selection has gone and electronic algorithms, not Sophie, will be used to make the selection. No, Irsquom not keen on this online business at all. Yes, I know seven million in the UK alone are registered. But how can a list of preferences predict chemistry I tell myself to shut up. And havenrsquot the likes of Sharon Stone, Melanie Sykes and Ulrika Jonsson gone online to find a special friend  If nothing , this suggests there are some interesting women out there.Time to start. The first place has to be Tinder, doesnrsquot it  For one thing, the phone download is free. All you have to do is swipe in the direction of the female of your choice, hope that yoursquore her choice and arrange a meet. And before you can say ldquoCongratulations, yoursquore taking her up the aisle.Or are you  For me, the reality of Tinder turns out to be something rather dferent. I wonder, ldquoDo I look as old as some of the women Irsquom swiping away  What a frightening thought.What I also find hard to comprehend is why someone would post pics of themselves with a Bambi nose superimposed, or little devil horns, or cartoon whiskers. Christ, I donrsquot want to go out with a Hanna-Barbera cartoon.What you also learn is that some of the women are eastern European and, rather surprisingly, seem keen to have a much older, rather well-off boyfriend. Perhaps I should be wary.What I do like about Tinder, however, is that people are fairly obvious as to their requirement. I like the women who say, ldquoNo hook-ups, which means they donrsquot want a one-night stand.Yet a Psychology Today profile of Tinder suggests Irsquom more likely to meet a short-termist on Tinder. ldquoSome of those iniduals motivated by such social pressure and instant gratication are also more impulsive, less likely to be faithful and committed, and more interested in having sex for casual reasons, claimed the writer.Irsquove also discovered another possible Tinder problem. One PR company recently created male Tinder profiles, ensuring the name, picture and age remained unchanged, but changed the job title.Claiming to be a builder, they said, nearly doubles your chances of a being Liked. Now, I can hammer home a decent metaphor, mix up a decent simile but I canrsquot treat a damp patchfor the le of me.What I canrsquot nail is a Tinder match. At the last count, Irsquod counted up -odd likes and there are females Irsquove liked the look profile of. But the problem is we donrsquot like each other. It makes me wonder how an app which can have  pages about me on my filendash and million users ndash canrsquot match me up. Surely Sophie Plummett would have pulled someone out of the hat Itrsquos time to look online again. And be optimistic  A survey carried out by dating site Badoo found that people in Glasgow had the best chance in Scotland of landing their Saturday night date. But thatrsquos not love. Thatrsquos a lumber.It seems the problem with internet dating is it represents the paradox of choice. Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard once wrote of ldquothe dizziness of freedom. He could have been thinking about the huge volume of internet dating options out there, the anxiety that so much online choice can create. He could have been thinking that, while choice has soared, personal connection has dissolved.Psychologist Michael Rosenfield has underlined this problem. He suggests that finding an online partner is all about learning, narrowing down your criteria,just in case you seek ldquoa same-sex partner, or a partner who is a vegetarian mountain-climbing Catholic.Well, I donrsquot, as it happens. But isnrsquot this all a bit soulless  Does tossing more algorithms at a robot really increase our chances  Or at the end of the day, do we simply connect or not  How can we work out what we want in a partner ndash even when we can never be exactly sure until we meet that person.And letrsquos go back to Glasgow. Online dating company Eharmony says itrsquos ldquothe most single city in Scotland. However, the reasons are not encouraging. ldquo per cent of Glaswegians have given up on finding love completely,  per cent feel overwhelmed by the modern dating landscape and  per cent think theyrsquoll be single forever.Wow. Thatrsquos depressing stuff. The company cites lack of confidence and low self-esteem as playing a major factor. Well, that doesnrsquot apply personally but I have to admit Irsquom edging towards ldquothe  per cent who worry their age is having a negative effect on their search for love.The survey goes on to cite negative past relationships as a factor, and meeting the wrong people on bad dates. ldquoIn fact, a quarter of Glaswegian singles have not had a relationship in over  years.Oh, dear. The allotment beckons. Or having to sign up for a singles holiday in Machu Picchu where Irsquoll meet lots of sturdy women in combat pants and open-toed sandals.I try another internet dating service. Itrsquos called Ourtime and within a couple of hours of filling in the forms I have  likes. I donrsquot knowthatrsquos good or bad. I do know it will cost pound. a month to find out who fancies me. Then therersquos Elite. Which isnrsquot very. Itrsquos claimed to be the dating agency for professionals. I try that one too, but what is a professional  Elite seems to think itrsquos hairdressers or care workers.The website also seems to disregard geography. I declared I wanted to meet someone within a -mile radius and up pops Sandra from Craigavon and Maisie from Nottingham I know. If I were really that keen on finding love Irsquod open my arms to Maisies. I need to widen my outlook. I need to be positive and, like the other singletons, remind myself I live in a city thatrsquos been spiritually blessed by a love saint. St Valentinersquos remains are to be found in St Francisrsquos Church in the Gorbals. And didnrsquot Glasgow proclaim itself to be the City of Love in . That has to help What  can I try  My friend Liam suggests I try Thursday nightsat Waitrose and try to connect over a nice piece of haddock. But then he suggests I follow St Val into church. ldquoGo to mass to meet women, he enthuses. ldquoThere are loads of singles. Andtheyrsquove got kids, all you do is wait until they send the weans up for the Eucharist before making your move.I laugh because Irsquom thinking itrsquos not the craziest idea hersquos ever had. But on the other hand therersquos a real chance I could be hit by a bolt of lightningI recalibrate St Margaretrsquos Chapel as a pick-up place.What of the standard places to meet people these days  Salsa clubs  Yoga  Theyrsquore such a clicheacute but then you have to be in it to win it. Thatrsquos the feeling of Yvonne Carvel, who, along with Diane Goudie, runs the Raeburn Supper Club, which offers a meeting place ndash dinner or events ndash for  to -year-olds.ldquoInternet dating is popular but wersquove been going for  years now and we realised it isnrsquot for everybody. Wersquove learned of lots of less than pleasant experiences.Carvel points out chemistry can only be discovered with a personal meet. ldquoIf you come to a supper club you are met by one of us and itrsquos so much easier to break the ice. And those who register get the chance to meet lots of new friends, with the possibility this may lead to something .She adds, smiling: ldquoAnd it has, on many occasions.What I have learned is that effort is required,chances of meeting someone special are to be realised. Yes, Irsquoll have to advertise myself because standard social structures for meeting people donrsquot really apply as you move into your fties and sixties. Irsquoll have to submit to all-day-long evaluation before complete, often disinterested, sometimes mocking strangers who may find themselves just as dismissive as me because theyrsquore feeling just as anxious.I have to accept that single people need to shop themselves around. In an online blurb can I convince anyone Irsquom sexy, funny, intelligent, honest and decent ndash and the pics are recent.I have to push aside the statistic that claims that . per cent of women agree that money plays a part in how attractive they find a partner.And even though most online relationships fail, one in three begins online. Hang on, herersquos another statistic to end on.

As does everything , come to think of it.In SNP press release after press release, in speech after SNP speech, we are told there is only one direction of travel ndash onwards and upwards. :New poll published on Scottish independenceCome good times or bad, boom times or busts, rain or shine, nothing can ever be admitted to arrest the cause of independence, far less set it back. There is only forward motion.Which brings us to the coronavirus.Talented though the media mavens of SNP HQ may be, it is hard to put a positive spin on a traumatic pandemic.Most inconveniently, there are some things which are not in the business of boosting the Yes vote after all.But what dference will it make We are still only in the foothills of the outbreak, and the global economy has already been knocked sideways and le for millions disrupted.Far, far worse lies ahead.So it might seem indelicate to bring politics into the equation. But in truth politics never leaves the equation. It is a constant choice about how we live.:New indyref poll - Fewer than three out of  want another vote before In our small corner of the world, the virusrsquos impact on independence is already under discussion. One fellow scribbler this week suggested it would do the cause ldquono favours.SNP MPs duly pushed back on the idea that a pan-UK response with a whf of the Blitz spirit to it would undermine the case for going it alone.Some, no doubt, will also be pondering how the virus might reconfigure the electorate given the most vulnerable voters are also those most opposed to independence.But I believe most of our politicians, both at Holyrood and Westminster, will simply have the same instinctive concerns about friends, family and society as the rest of us, and do their best to help the country get to the other side of a grim summer.That said, I fear the virus will be more than a match for Nicola Sturgeon, Mr Johnson and their respective public services.People, in their distress, will look for someone to blame. But as the diseasersquos rapid spread has blind-sided the planet, I donrsquot think either leader will be seen as especially culpable. However, I do think the independence debate will change in both the short and medium term.For one thing, Ms Sturgeon can now drop the dim pretence about a second referendum this year.Boris Johnsonrsquos refusal after the general election and the lack of relevant powers at Holyrood always meant Indyref was a non-starter before the  Holyrood election, and possibly for some time after that.Yet to maintain a symbolic flicker of hope, and to avoid getting blamed by her own side for dropping the ball, the FM has kept diminishing herself by insisting it is still a live possibility.That can now end. The outbreak means Indyref this year is logistically and politically impossible.Besides ruling out a campaign involving hundreds of thousands of voter contacts, the virus has become every governmentrsquos Priority One.The public will not stand for money and manpower being erted into naked politicking while it rages.And despite the protestations of SNP MPs against columnists, the independence cause will suffer.Not necessarily because it will look like a bad fit for times of crisis. But because it will look like a decidedly second-order issue.Ms Sturgeon hasnrsquot been able to deliver Indyref so far, but she has been shrewdly fostering a sense of inevitability about it happening.She steadily built momentum, and was set to capitalise on it in .That is about to change.The Yes movement is entering a stall. No marches, no campaigning, no way to spin independence as an answer to the great issue of the day.That loss of hard-won momentum and a slide down a shell-shocked nationrsquos list of priorities will change the Scottish political landscape.However, that does not mean the SNP Government will be greatly disadvantaged at next yearrsquos election.The Scottish Tories, after all, had been planning to hammer the SNP on their -year record in office.But the virus throws a spanner in the stats they intended to deploy.The usual ammunition ndash fresh AE waiting times, treatment guarantees and exam results ndash wonrsquot be there.Instead, there will be a gigantic aberration, a freak lurch in the data arising from a natural disaster.Voters may remember the one-off failures like faulty hospitals and half-built ferries, but the Tory line that the SNPrsquos record has been on a steady downward track will struggle.Nor will Jackson Carlaw be able to credibly claim he could have handled the pandemic better. It will dwarf everyone.The question for a re-elected SNP would then become when is the right time to restart its old conversation When is the right time to say that independence is again the priority It may be a long time indeed."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11150885.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scots-ferries-fiasco-lifeline-island-replacement-seven-years-late","story":"Plans to replace the ageing ferry serving Islay have not yet even gone out to tender - four years after the Scottish Governments transport agency said it would actually have been built.Islay islanders believe the fiasco delays to building two ferries at newly nationalised Ferguson Marine have had a knock on effect on the progress of what transport minister Humza Yousaf said two years ago would help support its growing economy.The dual fuel replacement Arran ferry Glen Sannox and her sister - Vessel  - were due to enter service in mid- but the calamitous contract has doubled in price - and is now estimated at poundm - while work on the vessels will not be finished until at least  - four years late.: First Ministers \"great regret\" over state of Scotlands busiest leline ferryIt was five years ago, that Ferguson Marine in Port Glasgow was handed the pound million contract to build the two ferries.Last year distillers on Islay said they were facing major problems in transporting whisky over to the Scottish mainland because of a capacity crisis on the ferry links.CalMac, the taxpayer-owned ferry operator, has traditionally served Islay with two vessels, the MV Finlaggan and the -year-old MV Hebridean Isles, one of the oldest in the -vessel Scottish fleet.According to an eight-year-old Transport Scotland plan, the estimated timing for replacing MV Hebridean was up to , and sources have said the two vessels do not offer the capacity Islay needs to service its whisky and tourism sectors.The new ferry to complement MV Finlaggen is to have a clear focus on freight and sufficient passenger accommodation to meet anticipated demand.But according to the latest Transport Scotland estimates, a shipbuilding contract for the new Islay vessel is not expected to be awarded until the Autumn of this year, with the first phase of the tender not being initiated till the summer of this year.:First Minister intervention call over parlous state of Scotlands busiest ferryIn , Transport Scotlands Vessel Replacement and Deployment Plan had stressed that the MV Hebridean Isles should be the next ferry to be replaced.And two years ago Mr Yousaf in a statement titled \"Islay ferry pledge\" said that officials were investigating potential designs.Islay Community Councils ferry committee has raised its concerns about the delays with ministers complete with a dossier of issues that have beset the route from the Argyll and Bute mainland hamlet of Kennacraig to the island.It said thatthere had not been the delays in building Glen Sannox and her sister Vessel , the replacement ferry might even have been place in  - six years later than planned - but it now fears it will not be delivered until the middle of .Ferry committee chairman Jim Porteous said: \"A key reason for the delay has been the Ferguson Marine debacle and the delay in completion of the the ships at their yard.\"The side launch of the CalMac ferry Hebridean Isles at Selby in the s.The committee said that in September  alone, a peak time for the Islay route,  sailings were cancelled due to a redeployment of one of the Islay vessels to support the Arran service.

We are also increasing our staffing numbers across all disciplines.”NHS Orkney, Orkney Islands Council and the Integration Joint Boardare working very closely to ensure that our planning arrangements are comprehensive and to the very highest standard.”As ever, the response and action of the entire workforce has been overwhelming and the people of Orkney should take a great deal of assurance and pride from that fact.”NHS Orkney has also echoed national advice stating that folk should stay at home and self-isolate for seven daysthey display symptoms of the virus.The spokeswoman said: “All people with a new continuous cough and or high temperature , regardless of their travel history or contact with confirmed cases, should stay at home for seven days, do not come into the hospital and be aware you will not be tested.”If people are concerned about more serious symptoms ortheir symptoms worsen, they are advised to contact their GP in hours, or out of hours NHS on .”Again we ask that people stay home unless the GP or out of hours service suggests otherwise.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If we win, it would be absolutely fantastic. It would do our points tally no end of good. It will be very strange to be getting updates from people south watching Orkney while I#m watching Orkney at home.#This topic actually was included in #s Knowledge newsletter where a crack team of anoraks answer some of the most obscure questions on footballing knowledge.One twitter user asked: “Has a professional team in living memory had to play twice in a day ”The question attracted several responses.#If you go back a century or more, this wasn’t unusual, and arose from teams who were unable to play in midweekand having to cram in postponed games before an end-of-season deadline,” writes Andrew Wright, citing several in Scotland including Celtic’s wins over Raith and Motherwell on April , .“Argentina and Uruguay have played each other twice on the same day three times,” Andrew continues. “In , they played friendlies in Montevideo and Buenos Aires on  April. Given the distance between these cities is km, I doubt the same players were involved. Uruguay won - at home and drew - away. They repeated the exercise on July , with Uruguay winning - at home and drawing - away.#On October , , they played for the Uruguayan Honour Cup in Montevideo, with Argentina winning -, and the same day, in Avellaneda for the Lipton Cup, where Argentina again won -.#He also unearths a more recent example from an African football blog: Nairobi’s Gor Mahia played KTM Thika and Kericho Allstars on the same day in the s.Brazil have also crammed two fixtures into a day, adds Amadeu Faccini Avi, drawing - with the Soviet Union and beating Hungary - in , one in Rio and one in São Paulo.Staying in Brazil, São Paulo beat Sporting Cristal - in the Conmebol Cup on the same dayas a - triumph over Grêmio. Not to be outdone, Grêmio played three games on one day in , against Aimoré, Santa Cruz and Brasil de Pelotas, all in their state cup.“Thirty-four players were involved and three of them played more than once,” Amadeu adds.In England, Everton once played three matches in two days in , writes Tim Lawrence — in the Lancashire Cup against Blackburn on Christmas morning followed by an annual exhibition against Ulster FC in the afternoon, winning both. The following day they wearily drew - with Bootle.Most recently, Hornchurch of the Ryman League had to play two games in a day at the end of the   season and in Wales, Mark Barnes recalls a youthful Wrexham side, who took on Airbus in the Welsh Cup in December , kicking-off a mere half hour before a more experienced Red Dragons selection beat Brentford in the FA Cup.A link to the article is here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!.

Every second seat will be left unoccupied in a “checkerboard pattern”. Paul John Anderson, director of Omniplex, said the move was in line with World Health Organisationguidance. “This means we’ve reduced our overall capacity by  per cent and it will give cinemagoers peace of mind,” he said. Mr Anderson said other measures will include self-scanning of tickets, increased cleaning regimes and hand-sanitising stations in every cinema foyer.Tesco have taken an approach by introducing a maximum purchase limit of five per customer on a number of items to ensure everyone can access the essentials. Customers are urged to shop as they normally would and not change their routes as they work hard to restock shelves as quickly as possible.The Public Health Agencyconfirmed that  tests have been carried out since testing began on February , of which  were negative, and  positive.Other strict hand-sanitising measures have come into effect in Belfast’s residential care homes and children’s crèches exercising strict entry hygiene protocols for those visiting relatives or leaving and picking up children.In their statement released on Wednesday, the PHA said they are continuing to conduct the process of “contact tracing” people who have had close contact with anyone diagnosed with COVID-. The agency is urging those who have been advised to self-isolate to do so, but is also reassuring anyone who hasn’t been contacted as part of this process to “go about their daily business and follow the COVID- advice for all members of the public.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"eskander wants another chance of life","story":"ESKANDER ran for an hour in total darkness the night the military burned down his family home. His mother had told him to run to her brother’s house to find refuge: the military had already come in the night and killed his father and his brother, and he was likely to be in similar danger. That night, the military forced his mother to sign over ownership of their family farm to the state.Eskander had been imprisoned for four months in an underground prison in Ethiopia without his family’s knowledge, almost one hundred miles away from their farmstead in Dima. Dima is in the Ethiopian regional state of Oromia, the homeland of the Oromo people: a large minority ethnic group who have been subject to political oppression, cultural suppression and the victims of internment and state violence. He had been taking part in a student protest at the technical college where he was studying electrical engineering, carrying a placard that read Stop Killing Oromo People, when the military arrived and opened fire on the protest group. Between forty and fty of the students were arrested and taken to a military camp. From there, he was sent to the underground prison where he was beaten with sticks, cut with knives and tortured with hot metal bars. His body is still marked with the scars from this torture. All of this happened in , and the following year, after he’d lived in hiding with his uncle for five months, his mother sold her possessions to raise funds for Eskander to escape Ethiopia to the relative safety of South Sudan.In April  he left Ethiopia. This was only the beginning of a decade of turmoil that saw the teenage college student progress through his twenties working for two years without pay on a building site in Sudan, imprisoned in Libya by people smugglers, crossing the Mediterranean in a plastic dinghy, being subjected to a brutal assault by a group of men in Italy, living in a bus station near Milan and spending time in Direct Provision in Monaghan before finally boarding a bus to seek a new le of safety in Belfast in April . He claimed asylum, but refugee status and the stability that comes with it has not yet been granted.All of this was written in a statement he’d made for the Home Office through an interpreter. It will form part of his application to be granted five years leave to remain. He sat in silence as I read it all in a coffee shop on the Ormeau Road along with our running coach at Annadale Striders, Michael McKnight. We had gotten to know Eskander well in the preceding year and his positivity and enthusiasm for running had won us over. The scale of the horror he’d been through was until then unknown to us. After he arrived in Ireland, a doctor in the south suggested that running would be a good way of helping to manage the trauma of his experiences, and he was a natural.“I ran my first race on St Patrick’s Day, , in Dublin, with no training,” he told me, “and I ran eighteen minutes for k. I wore thin shoes from Lidl.”He was a natural and he stepped up his training while living in Monaghan, winning many races, and the medals and trophies he won adorn his bedside table in his small room in Stranmillis, along with newspaper cuttings about his athletic achievements. His dedication to running is unwavering, and to those who know his story his successes have been inspirational. He has been on the podium of many road races in the north, including the Laganside k and the Armagh International k, and has matched the course record time at Ormeau Parkrun. The week after he matched the record, dragging me along with him to a personal best of under sixteen minutes, the two of us ed and he was treated like a celebrity: I was approached by several people excitedly asking “do you think Eskander can break the record this time ”For all his talent on the road, it’s cross-country racing where he really shines. At the McConnell Shield race in Ballyclare, one of the north’s oldest and most prestigious races, he put in a stellar performance against some of our best runners. When I crossed the line at that race, Paul Lawther, an original Annadale Strider, and a one-time NI record holder at every distance from m to ,m, immediately said to me with sheer delight: “Did you see what Eskander just did ” He had put a ten second gap on the field in the last four hundred metres, beating two Northern Ireland international athletes. Recently, he finished in second place overall at the prestigious NI and Ulster Senior Cross- Country Championship.It would appear that this is barely scraping the surface of his potential. Michael McKnight has talked with Athletics NI officials about Eskander’s talents and the international representation that could easily follow. Eskander himself dreams of running for Ireland at the European Cross-Country Championships.“I want to make a story for Belfast, for athletics and for Ireland,” he told me.For any of that to happen he needs to negotiate the dficult process of gaining refugee status. He often jokes with me that next year he’s “going to Kenya to train withEliud Kipchoge”, but when it comes down to it he says that what he really wants is “independence and safety, to be free from distress and to be able to breathe in peace again”.Eskander’s gentle manner belies the deep effects of the events of the last decade, of the toll they have taken on his body and mind. He tells me that he continues to require medication to manage the effects of the trauma, to cope with depression and to allow him to sleep. He feels that this is his last chance to make a le for himself he is committed to studying several days each week in Belfast Met, developing his spoken and written English. He tells me that he cherishes his friends and the sense of community he has found in Belfast, that he has been accepted to continue with his study of electrical engineering that was ended abruptly at the time of his imprisonment, but it depends on the Home Office’s decision. He tells me with increasing desperation that he hopes the Home Office will give him another chance at le."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"invest ni host 319 visits by investors but only 14 came to west of","story":"ONLY  visits were made to the West Belfast constituency by potential inward investors, hosted by economic development agency Invest NI, compared to  in South Belfast new figures reveal.The figures for   also show that East Belfast received  visits, while North Belfast had  visits. West Belfast is continually at the bottom of Invest NI inward investor figures for the city.West Belfast MP Paul Maskey told the Andersonstown News that he has already requested a meeting with the newly appointed Invest NI CEO Kevin Holland to discuss his concerns and how the agency has “treated West Belfast over the years”.“It is clear that these figures highlight the inequalities in certain areas,” he said.“Invest NI have a history of igoring areas like West Belfast over the years and I will be stating that quite clearly at the meeting. Thankfully the unemployment rate in West Belfast has reduced in recent years, but it could be further reducedInvest NI stepped up to the mark and brought potential investors to this part of the city.“I will also be raising with them about their lands in West Belfast and what they plan to do to ensure they are used and developed to assist future investors. I will be insisting the new CEO recies this ongoing inequality as a matter of urgency.”SDLP representative Paul Doherty said that with signicantly less inward investment visits taking place here than in other parts of the city, West Belfast is yet again “being left behind”.“We want to see all of Belfast prosper, but this is simply unacceptable given the level of high unemployment and ongoing disadvantage experienced by the people of West Belfast.“I will be calling for an urgent meeting with Invest NI to seek clarity on why West Belfast continues to receive unfair treatment. Invest NI has a responsibility to target areas of need and I will be making it clear to them that they must ensure that West Belfast is given greater priority going forward.”The local rep said it is understandable why Invest NI have come under pressure to change the way they operate.“These figures are testimony to that. This isn’t a one-off either, we have seen similar figures year in, year out which are consistent with the decline in investment and jobs in West Belfast and a constant flow where,” he said.“At present, we have companies in West Belfast who are eager to expand and provide those all-important and much-needed employment opportunities. We also need to harness the potential of the talented workforce that already exists in West Belfast, and it is key that Invest NI assist companies in making that a reality.“I have met with some talented entrepreneurs in West Belfast in the last number of months and they too are understandably frustrated at what they see as constant missed opportunities of bringing investors to this part of the city where they can engage and pitch the potential of this area for investment.“We need to showcase West Belfast. The continued growth of Huhtamaki, based just off Kennedy Way, is further proof that West Belfast can be a great place for businesses to locate, but it is vital we build on that. Invest NI need to develop stronger relationships with all stakeholders in the West in order to grow current businesses such as Huhtamaki, who can continue to grow and employ more people.”A spokesperson for Invest NI said: “Invest NI and the  local councils are actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of Northern Ireland. Investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.“For example, nearly  per cent of Invest NI’s offers are to companies outside of Belfast, with recent investments in Derry such as the  jobs being created by Alchemy Technology Services, the  jobs being created by Fintru, the  jobs being created by Danske Bank, the  jobs being created by Terex Corporation as part of a £ million investment in a new facility in the city and expansions by Computershare and Axa.”“Addressing the point that over  per cent of inward visits go to Belfast – this should be viewed in context. The vast majority of visit programmes start in Belfast before going to other locations, or in some cases the investor has no time to visit specic locations so are hosted at our HQ in Belfast. What is more relevant is that over the last five years, nearly  per cent of investors chose to locate their project outside of Belfast.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"new inquest sought","story":"RELATIVES For Justice are to ask the Attorney General for a fresh inquest into the circumstances surrounding the death of republicanprisoner Francis Dodds.From St Katherine’s Road in St James’, Francis Doddswas sentenced to four years imprisonment in March  for possession of explosive material. The father-of-four was sent to Long Kesh, Cage , to serve out his sentence. It is understood that when Mr Dodds arrived he was in his bare feet after his shoes were confiscated. That night a serious confrontation took place which resulted in British troops being sent in to restore order. Francis was on the receiving end of a severe beating which left him heavily bandaged and needing crutches to walk.Medical notes detail how Mr Dodds consistently sought medical attention for chest pains, extending to his left arm and for a discoloured and infected big toe. The Medical Officer for the prison examined him and recommended that he be referred for an arteriogram. Despite this no arteriogram was ever carried out. On September   Francis was examined by a doctor and told he was fine. The following day, September , he collapsed and died. The post-mortem report determined that the cause of death as coronary thrombosis.Mr Dodd’s sister Joan Nolan told the Andersonstown News that any information from those who were in prison the same time as her brother would be of great help to her family’s case.“I was  when Francis died, there were six of us and Francis was the only boy. I had gone to Canada and was in Canada when Francis died. I didn’t get home for the funeral and Canada was just a nightmare then,” she said.The Dodd’s family, supported by RFJ, say Francis’ death may have been avoidedhe had been removed from Long Kesh for thorough medical examination. Joan described her brother as very much a “joker” and “young at heart”.“Francis left behind a we and four children. He would have been a very proud father with his daughter getting her -Plus and going to St Dominic’s Grammar School.“Unfortunately I’m the only one left of the family, any fresh information would be very beneficial to the family, he was my brother.”Speaking on behalf of RFJ, caseworker Paul Butler said Mr Dodds had been complaining of chest pains for several months before his death.“The prison’s medical officer had attended to him on six dferent occasions in the weeks before his death. Moreover, in April and May  – four months before he died – Francis had been taken to Lagan Valley and Royal Victoria Hospitals in relation to pain in his left foot which was also discoloured and obviously a circulation problem.“The hospital had recommended that he be referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital for an arteriogram. This is a procedure that examines the arteries to seethere are any blockages. The prison governor refused to allow this and unfortunately Francis was ed to Long Kesh and no arteriogram took place before he died.”Former prisoners can contact RFJ on   or email paul.butler@relativesforjustice"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rising star alanna gives hope to those in distress","story":"A SPRING Ball is set to take place at the Devenish Complex with all proceeds raised from the night going towards the vital work of mental health awareness charities.‘Stand By Me’, the brainchild of local man Daniel McGinley, will take place on Friday, March  and will feature an array of vocal talent including the launch of ‘Hidden Hope’, the new album and single from rising Twinbrook talent Alanna Flynn.A songwriter since age of , Alanna told the Andersonstown News how music has always been an important part of her le and how songwriting helped her through her own struggles with mental health.“I have always wanted to make an album for charity and the reason why the proceeds raised from it and the single will go towards Suicide Awareness and Support Group is because I’ve struggled with my own mental health,” she told us. “I went through a really dark period of time, I know what’s it like to be in a dark place.

We think it comes from animals. It seemed to be localised in this Chinese wet market , it#s likely an animal was infected with this virus and it gave a human the virus.That has allowed the virus to spread very, very efficiently.It#s just this fact that it can be transmitted really well and unfortunately it does cause severe disease.That has allowed it to take hold in countries like China, South Korea, Iran, Italy and likely in the UK.Why has Italy been so badly affected Dr Bamford: We don#t really know. It could have happened to anyone, likely it will be a part of bad luck, under testing, under awareness in the population, or simplythere was more flights connecting to China.Will there be a change of approach now it#s been declared a pandemic Dr Broadbent: It doesn#t really change anything.The word pandemic doesn#t mean anything, it#s only used by the World Health Organisationwhen they don#t think world leaders are taking enough notice of this. It#s more of a political move than a scientic move and it#s really to make sure world leaders take it seriously.What are the symptoms of coronavirus Dr Bamford: The main symptoms are a sore throat, a fever, you probably wouldn#t be feeling very well, quite cold-like.You have a cough as well and this could transpire into dficulties breathing.We know that while anybody can get infected by the virus, there#s quite a big iation in the symptoms.What happensthere#s a confirmed case Dr Broadbent: If your symptoms are mild, you#re asked to self-isolate.Your family may also have to self-isolateyou live with people. Then you#re basically told to keep a good eye on your symptoms.If you start to experience shortness of breath, struggling to breathe, that#s when you have to get back in touch with . If it becomes an emergency situation and you#re incredibly struggling to breathe then that#s when you ring the ambulance and you have to make sure you tell them you tested positive.How can you prevent the spread Dr Broadbent: People are probably sick of hearing it, but they do need to practise good hand hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your face is really important.What is herd immunity Dr Bamford: The idea is thatyou are infected , there will be a period afterwards where you cannot be infected.For it to have a real effect, you would need a sizeable amount of the population to be infected, probably %.That will lead to a considerable number of deaths, so I think that really isn#tof stopping the virus.The best way to get herd immunity is through a vaccine.Are face masks useless Dr Bamford: Face masks aren#t recommended.aren#t completely useless because surgeons wear them, dentists wear them.But they#re under very controlled conditions, so it#s not really recommendedpublic to wear them.How long will it take for a vaccine to be available Dr Broadbent: There are several tests that need to be done before they can made public.

Expectant mums have also raised concerns that they may not be allowed visitors following labour.We all have to do our bit and it might seem like a small issue in a very serious situation, but they are all things that our mummies are telling us, she said.As a result of the concerns being raised by Daisy Foundation members, the organisation is also offering support to mums across Northern Ireland as the response to the spread of coronavirus moves into delay phase.New mums, babies and children are physically in a low risk category but that isn#t necessarily the case with their mental health, continued Jess.When you have a brand new baby for the first time, that can be a very dficult and anxious time and we are hearing that NHS classes are being cancelled.It#s not okayyou are pregnant and you can#t access your planned antenatal education or you can#t access the support that you need as a new mum.As a short-term emergency provision, we#re offering antenatal classes and our other usual Daisy classes in a live, interactive online forum.This means that no mummies have to miss out on that vital support at a time when they are extremely vulnerable, eventhey can#t get out of the house.Read More Coronavirus: Slowdown for the hospitality industry leads to cost-cutting in Northern IrelandBelfast ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

If you have any of these symptoms, however mild, stay at home and do not leave your house for seven days from when your symptoms started. This applies to everyone.“If you develop symptoms common with coronavirus, this action will help protect those close to you such as older family members, those with underlying health conditions or a weakened immune system, and others in our community.”Those experiencing a continuous cough and or a high temperature should stay at home for seven days from the onset of the symptoms.Dr Hyland said that, while self-isolation can be frustrating, there are certain steps that can be followed to make the process easier.These include:Plan ahead and think about what you will need in order to be able to stay at home for the full seven days should you be required to.Talk to your employer, friends and family to ask for their help to access the things you will need in order to successfully stay at home.If there are other people living in your home, stay at least two metresaway from them and use your own bathroom facilitiespossible and sleep alone.If your symptoms worsen during home isolation or are no better after seven days, seek medical advice by phone.The PHA has stated that those who are self-isolation with mild symptoms will not be tested.Belfast Related ContentVideoCoronavirusCoronavirus: Decision not to close Northern Ireland schools based on #clear scientic evidence#The First and Deputy First Ministers jointly insisted yesterday that the Executive chose not to close Northern Ireland#s schools based on scientic evidence.CoronavirusCoronavirus: Northern Ireland Hospice in funds plea to Executive to ensure services not disrupted The head of the Northern Ireland Hospice has said the organisation faces an unprecedented challenge as the coronavirus crisis escalates.CoronavirusCoronavirus: Sport goes into lockdown in bid to halt spreadSport in Northern Ireland is facing up to a lockdown this month and beyond due to the coronavirus with a number of sporting bodies postponing matches and suspending fixtures indefinitely.VideoCoronavirusUK and Republic split on coronavirus response with Northern Ireland caught in middle of mixed messagesThe British and Irish Governments have both insisted they are dealing with coronavirus in the right way after they announced radically dferent approaches to tackling the pandemic.CommentOpinionTom Kelly:Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar need common approach tocoronavirus threatRemember the song about Simple Simon  The one were he says and you do  ,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There is support out there for you.The visit to meet President Higgins was arranged by the charity Rare Diseases Ireland, which helps people struggling with ious disorders.Aine was first diagnosed with speech dyspraxia and development delay while she was still at primary school.After P things went downhill as I acted dferently and a lot of people thought I had autism. Instead I had the rare genetic disorder called p minus syndrome, she explained.She said she was diagnosed with the condition at the age of  following an MRI scan.She described being told the news as a shock but also a relief because she finally knew what she had.So I did a bit of research and I found a charity down south called Rare Diseases Ireland and messaged them, she said.

We need to bring more people with rare genetic conditions together from Northern Ireland and the south to share and exchange their experiences, support and learn from each other.I know my genetic disorder is rare.

Almost inevitably, either at the Ulster Hall or the King#s Hall or further afield, he would seek me out, put his arm around my shoulder and say, #Well Jimbo, we got away with that one again and now the winners can celebrate and the losers can please themselves#, Mr Neilly told the congregation.He had much to celebrate. He was a sportsman, a sports fan, a sports aficionado, a promoter, an entrepreneur, a splendid judge of horse flesh, dog flesh and when it came to boxing, man flesh, a connoisseur of fine art and fine wines, but what he celebrated most was his family.He always said that his greatest cause for celebration was the day that he married his beloved Frances.Frances, being very astute, would say that it was a very close run thing between the wedding day and the day that he scored four points at Croke Park to help the Tyrone minors win the All-Ireland Championship title.She said that the wedding just about got there by a very short head.Mr Neilly recalled the day Mr Eastwood came to the BBC with a very modest proposal to get boxing on the television. We met more than  years ago and there hadn#t been much in the way of boxing, he said.The s was a barren era for boxing here but after the Moscow Olympics in , he had a good look at one or two people whom he thought had potential - Hugh Russell in particular who had a bronze medal, and Barry McGuigan, who should have had a medal.He came to the BBC in Northern Ireland with a very modest proposal and said he would start promoting boxingthe BBC would provide the pictures.There was a lot of debate about it and one or two people weren#t very keen because boxing was a bit #poo-poo#.The then head of programming Cecil Taylor, said yes we#ll go for it and that#s how the whole thing started.Mr Neilly also retold a heart-warming story Mr Eastwood#s son had shared with him during his final days as his closing remarks were met with a round of applause by the congregation.Not that long ago a few of the family were sitting around him in bed and his eyes opened and he eased himself up and unprompted and unrehearsed, for no reason whatsoever, he came out with the immortal line, #the show must go on#, Mr Neilly said.Of course, the show must go on and, of course, the show will go on but it will go on, alas, without one of its brightest stars. Rest in peace.In a statement earlier this week, Mr Eastwood#s family said his passing had brought great sadness to the family as well as the whole community in Holywood, where he was a very visible resident for the past  years.All who knew him will miss his remarkable charm, they added.Mr Eastwood was laid to rest at Redburn Cemetery in Holywood following the service.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.RegisterAlready have an account Log in Belfast   Related ContentNorthern IrelandGrand niece leads the political tributes to Barney Eastwood Alliance councillor Sorcha Eastwood has paid tribute to her grand uncle Barney as a giant of a man who showcased the best of Northern Ireland in his role as a boxing promoter.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadBarney Eastwood funeral hears how boxing lost #brightest star#Tribute met with applause as legendary boxing figure BJ Eastwood is laid to restWinston Rea lawyers come off case citing #professional conflict issues#Northern Ireland care home residents #dehumanised#, rooms had barcodes on doors instead of namesCoronavirus: On either side of Irish border, a struggle to comprehendthe implications of crisis,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Auditors from energy watchdog Ofgem have deemed this irregular spending, which is expected to hit a total of £m by the year  .In , there was a massive spike in applications to the scheme which the RHI inquiry was told was partly due to information being shared with the renewable energy industry.The then Department for Enterprise discussed possible tarf cuts to the scheme with firms in the biomass sector in the summer of that year.One civil servant told the inquiry  he thought there should have been less promotion of the scheme as officials already knew the cost for that year was twice the available budget. Ex-DUP MLA Jonathan Bell, then the minister responsible for RHI, told the inquiry that officials had not informed him of the spike in applications.It was told that one adviser said we could fill our boots as the scheme was being paid for from the Westminster budget, rather than Stormont#s.The forecast cost of the RHI scheme in   is £-m, thanks to cost controls which were put in place in . Before these changes were introduced the total cost was expected to be around £.bn, more than twice the scheme#s estimated cost of £m when it was set up in .Those who may face criticism in Sir Patrick#s report this week have already been given the opportunity to respond to his findings.The Monday following his publication, Sinn Fein Finance Minister Conor Murphy will face questions from MLAs in the Assembly.In total, the Executive#s legal bill for the inquiry is estimated at £.m, with the overall cost of the nearly year-long investigation put at £.m.The RHI scheme was launched by then economy minister Arlene Foster in  and was meant to encourage businesses to switch from fossil fuels to renewable sources.But the low cost of the wood pellet fuel compared to the generous subsidies created a burn to earn scenario where boilers could be operated purely to make a profit from the scheme.Belfast Related ContentGalleryNewsDissident given le for killing prison officer Ismay undertook weapons trainingDissident killer Christie Robinson was hell-bent on killing a prison officer and underwent weapons training to prepare himself for murder.Irish League LivesIrish League Lives: Legendary keeper George Dunlop on calling time on his own glittering Blues careerBig Ivan Little takes a fair share of stick about his television gaffe many years ago when his vocabulary expertise failed him in his pronunciation of the word phenomenon.NewsDisgraced youth group leader jailed over park sex actThis is the disgraced former youth group leader who has been jailed after being caught on video committing a lewd sex act in front of three teenage girls. was delighted to take Carl The Jackal Frampton, World Champion Boxer and NICIE patron to visit Glengormley High today.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   was delighted to take Carl The Jackal Frampton, World Champion Boxer and NICIE patron to visit Glengormley High today.\"SportOpinionCarl Frampton:My integrated education came through boxing and it allowed me to develop lelong friendships with CatholicsIn some ways, Northern Ireland has moved forward and in others it has stood still and that#s why I#m so passionate about the development of integrated education across the land. sundayleThug who attacked teen with samurai sword jailed for nine yearsA man who attacked a teenager with a samurai sword has been jailed for nine years.sundayleCourt translator appears in dock himself to admit growing cannabis plantsA Northern Ireland court service interpreter has appeared in the dock himself to admit growing cannabis. from Brazil, accused of causing the road death of Ballycastle man Francis Wilsonthrough careless driving.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   from Brazil, accused of causing the road death of Ballycastle man Francis Wilsonthrough careless driving.\"sundayleSouth American student charged with causing death of Co Antrim dad-of-three by careless drivingA South American student has been charged with causing the death of a Co Antrim dad-of-three by careless driving.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadTribute met with applause as legendary boxing figure BJ Eastwood is laid to restBarney Eastwood funeral hears how boxing lost #brightest star#Winston Rea lawyers come off case citing #professional conflict issues#Coronavirus: On either side of Irish border, a struggle to comprehendthe implications of crisisNorthern Ireland care home residents #dehumanised#, rooms had barcodes on doors instead of names,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I try not to think about it – it’s  feet,” added Sandra.Sharon is keen to give something back to the charity that were so helpful following the death of her husband, Liam, five years ago.“I’m doing it is because my husband was in the City Hospital and he actually died in the Cancer Centre. “I’m want to give back because I had first-hand experience of how good they were.“They have a desk set up on the bottom floor so you can have a chat to someone. On the wards they provide tea, coffee and magazines.“I had a wee room I could have slept inneed be. They have a lot of extra things that you wouldn’t normally have for families that are up there quite a bit.”“That they were there to chat to you was the main thing, especially in Belfast because you can be a bit isolated. The money can be spread between it and Derry, so it’ll go to benefit local people.”Both women work at St Patrick’s College, Dungiven, where Sandra is a cleaner and Sharon a SEN assistant. They said the school has backed them since the fundraising began.“The school have been very supportive. They held a non-unorm day just before Christmas and we’re getting some proceeds from a run in January.“We have about pound, so far and we’re very grateful.”HopefulSharon and Sandra are hopeful that continued support for the charity will sustain the improvement in cancer services over the last few decades.Sandra said: “I lost my mother and father four months apart and my first husband  years ago to cancer. “Things have changed a lot – back then you were on your own. Nobody talked about it.”This is not the only fundraising drive the two friends have run and they have both taken an active role in promoting and supporting the services that helped them.Sharon said: “We did a sponsored walk, which was Sandra’s idea, the year my husband died and we presented the Cancer Centre with a painting of Benbradagh, so it’s up there now. “The walk involved the community, whereas now I wanted to do something I didn’t have to ask others to do with us, something we could do ourselves and they could donate.”To donate to Sharon and Sandra’s effort, visit their Just Giving page at https:www.justgiving fundraising Sharon-McElhinney. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

This reduces the release of destructive greenhouse gases into the atmosphere making our skies cleaner and it’s also half the price of sending food to landfill.By encouraging everyone in the family to get involved inrecyclingwe can create a cleaner, greener more sustainable place to live.”The council said that last year over  tonnes of food and garden waste wererecycled, which is a % increase from the previous year.A council spokesperson said: “Making an effort torecycleitems like uneaten bread, egg shells, fish or meat bones and peelings from fruit and vegetables can really help our environment.“Simple steps like keeping the food caddy in the kitchen, convenient for scraping uneaten food from plates and dishes can make a big dference.“People are also reminded that they can reduce the amount of waste that they are producing by planning meals ahead and buying fewer goods in bulk. Freezing and storing food also reduces waste as food that may be dumped can be eaten at a later time.”More advice on food recycling is available on the councils website. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We’ve also used our mixology experience in the restaurant to develop some gorgeous new cocktails using the Earhart Gin. ‘New Foundlove’ is a stunning local apple-based gin cocktail, whilst ‘Little Red Bus’ is named after Amelia’s own nickname for her bright red plane and is a fabulous twist on the classic Bloody Mary.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Yes, I’m talking about youBUT did you actually stop to HEAR the reply or is it just a ‘saying’ you churn out, a habit you say when, in actual fact, most of the time you say it, they say it and neither of you answer. Was nursery good today , What did you do today  are questions I hear most days from parents collecting children from nursery and school. BUT most of the time I actually think WHY ASK as two minutes laterthe parent is not actually talking or listening to the child.So what’s the point of asking  If you really are interested then take the time to listen. Don’t bother asking how are you your really don’t want to know. Yes, this does sound a bit harsh. I know I sound tough. BUT the simple truth is we do need to listen to each other more, be more aware of how our friends, family and, of course, our toddlers and children feel. How we feel is important, it links directly to our self esteem, our self confidence, our willingness to try new things, our ability to cope with problems, our ability to manage upsetting and worrying situations, our ability to form and maintain friendships whether we be two years old or . It involves understanding and being aware of our feelings and how to manage feelings of sadness, loneliness, anger and hurt. It is only by talking about how we feel that we learn to manage these feelings, find a way to overcome them so they don’t drown us, make us feel alone and unable to cope. We hear and see lots of messages in the media about mental health, about the importance of talking and listening to each other, but it is a two way street. If you are feeling down, your toddlers tantrums are getting too much, you are worried sick about the mounting bills, your boss is being unfair and expecting too much or you simply feel lonely, you must speak up and say. How can your family and friends helpthey don’t know -you paint on a smile then close the door and the tears come  In school this week, I had to teach pupils, aged six and seven, about being aware of how they feel and can make others feel. These discussions you can have at home, even with younger children, simple discussions about playing together, not leaving friends out, sharing, kind hands, what to dosomeone has no one to play with, what they could do or saysomeone in their class looks sad. What should they dothey hear someone being mean, someone being picked on, orsomeone makes them feel sad, breaks their toy, paints over their picture etc. I finished the lesson with a simple, ‘what nice thing did you do today.’ You can try this as a family at home. I had so many lovely answers, I played with Sophie, I made Jack laugh, I gave Matthew a turn of the ball, I wonder what nice things you and your children will talk about at tea time today It is important to remember your toddler and younger pre-school child when thinking about feelings too, talking about how you feel when they eat up all their tea, do a nice picture, play nicely with their baby sister etc. But to also talk about when they made you feel sad, when they didn’t tidy up, or cross when they shouted at you. This encourages an awareness of feelings and also enables them to learn about and name dferent emotions. Simple songs such as ‘If You Are Happy And You Know It’ can also have lines such as If You Are Sad Cross etc. Looking in the mirror together and making emotional faces can be fun too. Or make happy plates - happy faces on one side and cross or sad on the other and talk about what makes them feel this way. And, of course, books, talk about the characters how did Baby Bear feel when Goldilocks broke his chair and ate his porridge, how did Spot feel on his first day at nursery So that’s you, your family and friends sorted, but what about the person you don’t know  I know we can’t be responsible for everyone butwe share the message that feelings matter, support mental health awareness, then we can make a dference to each other and through a smile to that other person. The person who felt weighed down and your smile bought them a little bit of happiness, a little lt in a dark day, a thought that people do care, For, in the words of Mother Teresa…Every time you smile at someone, it is an action of love, a gt to that person, a beautul thing.So IF you’ve time to listen then ask how are you  If you are in a rush, say, sorry, I do hope you are good, or sorry, you know where I amyou need me, or big smiles to you or let’s catch up soon - do call me BUT don’t be in a rush every time and DO call! As for your toddlers and children and coming out of school, talk, listen, talk, listen TALK, LISTEN!Remember talk to your doctor, health visitor or your child’s teacheryou are worried about yourself, your child or someone  and, of course, visit Sure Start which offers lots of supportive services for families with young children. Plus many of the wonderful community services in Derry may be able to recommend a group or support service for you - just ask! You may also consider, Mental Health Service nidirect website.

Michael McMullan sat down with him to chat MacRory and also dug up a few insights from others on Lockharts days in the blue, white and black. Our sport coverage is brought to you in association with TJ Hamilton Cookstown Leader and perfectionist were two of the words the  edition of Magheras school magazine, The Patrician, used to describe MacRory winning captain Sean Martin Lockhart.In school tradition at the time, every senior  member would have a short synopsis penned about them. Lockhart was described as one of the most complete colleges players for a long time.“He was as solid as a rock, as youd imagine and he was always on the dangerman,” adds Padraig McKaigue who, with no previous goalkeeping experience, played behind him for both Derry minors and Maghera.McKaigue also points to a roasting Lockhart dished out to current Cavan minor manager Mickey Graham in an Ulster minor semi-final.Damian McErlain, who played on the  team with Lockhart, rated Magheras full-back line that year – John Heaney, Niall Farren and Micheaacutel Kelly – as the best he has played with or managed.“Nobody will ever appreciate how good they were,” he states.And then there was Lockhart. McErlain remembers the No Fear t-shirt Sean Marty would often wear and the jovial Niall Farren giving him plenty of stick for wearing it.“You can practice, practice, practice – Ill still beat you,” read the slogan on the back. It was made for him reckons McErlain, who played at centre-forward. His battles with Lockhart at least once a week at training were savage.“Some days you just never got a ball,” McErlain remembers. “Then, youd have a good day and hit - or something. You knew about it the next day – he took to you like a days work.”Now,  years after captaining Maghera to a -point final win over St Colmans, Lockhart leads Maghera into another final against their Newry rivals.Thenearly didnt happen. Lockhart had initially planned to leave school after fth year to become an electrician. There were also murmurs of a route into accountancy.“I would never have saw myself as a teacher or a manager. Back then, I had a job in an accounts office,” Lockhart recalls, but now there are no regrets.“Its a flash,” said Lockhart, of his memories. “I am talking to you about this years final...that was our year and I cant believe it is  years.”Back in the day, the careers room was the hub for pre-game meetings. Adrian McGuckin would address the  with a detailed and pristinely bound portfolio, specially commissioned for every game. It had everything from bus times to warm-up details. From a team list to a synopsis of the other teams strengths and weaknesses. There was a plan for playing with an extra man or having a man sent off. Every base was covered.Now, that corner on the second floor of the three-storey building houses the school staffroom. The faces have changed, but constant murmur of football chat competes with the aroma of hot tea.Lockharts MacRory career spanned three and a bit seasons. In , as a fourth year, he was added to the  towards the end of the campaign. The following year, he was corner-back. They needed two games to get over a St Patricks Armagh attack that had the bustling Des Mackin on the edge of the square.“Dessies gonna get you,” came the chants in the direction of Seanie McGuckin, who would win the battle. The final was a dferent story against St Colmans. Mackins county minor team-mate Diarmuid Marsden missed a penalty, but the Violet Hill men still took the cup, on their way to a Hogan title.In , Seanie McGuckin was now the fulcrum of the attack, leaving Lockhart to wear the number three jersey. Maghera went one better with St Patricks Armagh in the Athletics Grounds. Lockhart gave away height and weight to full-forward Conor McGurgan, but not much  in assured performance.Another masterclass, as McKaigue put it, came against Pat Spillanes nephewin a landslide win over St Brendans Killarney to set up a date with St Jarlaths Tuam and a chastening - to - defeat.It was a team that included Michael Donnellan, Padraig Joyce and Tommy Joyce, John Divilly, Declan and Tomas Meehan.“We had no specic plan to go for goals, but we were encouraged to go for themthey were on,” reveals former Donegal player John Haran, who was on that Jarlaths .“If you ever watch that game on video, Maghera actually had a lot of possession and missed a lot of chances. History is cruel, as it looked like an easy win.”Full-forward for Jarlaths was underage superstar John Concannon. He scored - that day, but failed to reach the same inter-county heights as the rest of the crop. Harans St Eunans team-mate Kevin Winston lashed in the first goal, before the Concannon show kicked in. It was a humbling hour for Lockhart.”All through that year, there was a chant  youll never beat Sean Lockhart but after  minutes hehad skinned me, scored - and the chant just stopped.” googletag.cmd.push  MacRory and Hogan champions. It was his last chance at a Hogan Cup medal. The following year, , he was one of six players, including starters David ONeill, Mark Diamond and Fintan Martin, who were overage for the All-Ireland series. Panellists Sean McPeake and Dominic Lynn, who wouldve been in contention, were also ineligible.The MacRory would be his last hurrah. In the quarter-final against St Macartans Monaghan, with Lockhart now as captain, goals from David ONeill and Mickey Gribbin put them on their way.Six days ahead of the semi-final, Maghera – with eight starters missing – defeated St Jarlaths Tuam, who had  of the Hogan winning team on view, in a low-scoring challenge game in Aghadrumsee. It was the perfect ending to the preparations.“We had a strong upper six and a strong lower sixth group. We were coming off the back of winning the Rannafast and there was great character in our team with a never say die attitude,” Lockhart feels. “We played Abbey . They had John McEntee, Tony McEntee, Enda McNulty and Aidan ORourke at a snow-swept Armagh.”Leading - to - at the break, Maghera had to face the elements in the second half but a Mark Diamond thunderbolt ot the net, into the driving snow, quashed any Abbey hopes. Now preparing for the final as a manager, Lockhart can now fully appreciate the support structures from his playing days.“Back then, as a player, you are in a wee bubble and Adrian protected us and he kept our feet firmly on the ground“Now as a manager, you have to organise food, travel, promotion and the media, so you see the whole package. But one thing you do see, you see the impact on the school. As a player, you thought it was about us in the team. It didnt go totally to plan for Lockhart in .“I remember breaking my finger the year before the final. I was playing pool with a few of my mates and we were just messing about.”It didnt matter, the final was a walk in the park. Colmans got the first point of the game, the only time Maghera were behind all year. That was as good as it got for the Newry side. They failed to score for over three quarters of the game and Lockhart – who also kicked a point - was left to lt the cup.It wasnt long until he received the call from Derry senior manager Mickey Moran. Within three years of leaving school, he would pick up an All-Ireland U medal and was full-back on the last team to win the Ulster SFC, in .He never gave Tony Boyle a kick in the Ulster final and combined with a performance on Padraig Joyce later in the year, he picked up an all-star.It was a baptism of fire in the early seasons as an inter-county defender. He vividly remembers a league clash with Clare and a tough afternoon marking Gerry McInerney. Lockhart has never forgotten the name.“I was wing-back and he scored - off me and skinned me. The older boys, like Henry Downey and Kieran McKeever, came over and said Sean Marty, you have made the county, your learning starts now.“I went back into full back and you had to educate yourself. You had collective training and there was the inidual work yourself. I had plenty of battles with boys after it.”Over the next week, Magheras defenders dont need to look any further for advice on how to curb the St Colmans attack.As our conversation finishes, Liam Kielt appears on the scene. After a brief, general, natter on football, his former Corn na nOacuteg manager enquiries about the Newry challenge. Lockhart recites a litany of names and dangers.“They have a good forward line,” was the sweeping statement centred on next Tuesdays taskThe preparations had long since begun. The  school magazine wasnt far off the mark. Leader. Perfectionist. And so the cycle continues. googletag.cmd.push   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

While parking availability can determine what parking style a motorist must use the research also highlighted preferences with  per cent of respondents selecting parallel parking over  per cent who chose perpendicular parking. Most annoying parking habitsParking scenarios can be tricky to navigate, and other drivers’ behaviour can have a huge impact on it, increasing the stress levels of motorists. When asked what motorists found to be the most annoying parking habits of other drivers the following where revealed as the top five:- Hogging two parking spaces - Parking in a disabled space when they had no disabled sign and weren’t a disabled driver - Parking too close to your car - Blocking you in so you can’t get out of your parking space - Blocking an entrance so you can’t get into your home or place of work  Commenting on the research, CEO of easytrip Ireland, Colin Delaney said: “While advanced technology has made parking hassle free for many there will be times that parking becomes stressful.“This could be down to parking preference spaces not being available or other drivers’ behaviour. “We would encourage drivers to take their time when parking and seek out a parking space they are comfortable with parking in. “It’s important to be considerate of other motorists needs and this includes parking between the white lines, not on them. Not parking in a space that is not dedicated for their use, whether that be a disabled, family or electric vehicle space, and not parking on double yellow lines. “Ultimately it’s about being considerate of others and making driving and parking less stressful for everyone.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Kane Williamsons side will play a three-match series against the hosts with the games taking place on ,  and  June.Bringing the World Cup finalists to the North West is a massive coup for the local Union however with the game set to attract global attention and television viewers in the millions worldwide, the staging costs will be high.Union Chairman Brian Dougherty and General Manager Peter McCartney have been hard at work in terms of attracting the necessary funding over the past number of months and were delighted to get the green light from Council last week.Confirming the details of the support, Mr Dougherty said that DSDC had agreed to help with the cost of ground equipment, legacy grassroots programmes and marketing  media promotion. The confirmation of Councils financial commitment to this major sporting event represents a signicant landmark in relations between our Union and DSDC. We are grateful not only for their monetary contribution but also for how they have committed to ensuring the series helps promote the region on the world stage he began.We are confident their support will also help lever additional finances going forward. This of course is also testament to the work of the Union, the hosts Bready CC and also Eglinton CC who will facilitate New Zealand training sessions during their stay here. We must also recognise the ongoing support of Cricket Ireland for cricket in the region and their backing for staging such high profile games in Bready. googletag.cmd.push OpportunityMayor, Michaela Boyle echoed those sentiments and suggested that this was an opportunity to show the sporting world what the North West has to offer.“The Cricket World Cup finalists coming to Bready for a competitive senior international is exciting news not just for cricket fans but for the wider sports fraternity in the North West.“I am delighted that Council have been able to support this high level fixture through the National Event Fund and I would like to congratulate Bready Cricket Club and the North West Cricket Union for their tireless work to secure these games.“This is one of the biggest sports fixtures to ever take place in our Council area. The games are an opportunity to showcase our region as a host for world class sports events both to the many spectators who will arrive in the city and to the viewers of Sky Sports.“We look forward to working with Cricket Ireland to host the players and supporters of New Zealand and cricket fans from all over Ireland, we can promise you an unforgettable experience in our City and District.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

With her fresh complexion, sparkling eyes and ready smile, few would believe that Mrs Jean Kelly is  years old.Secretly enjoying the fuss, Jean appeared happy to be sipping tea from a bone china teacup and saucer at her birthday party, which was attended by family, friends and staff members.While Jean grew up in the Roaring Twenties, it wasnrsquot all flappers and jazz bands around Lisowen mdash the townland outside Saintfield which was her home.Born Jean Stewart, she lived with her grandparents and attended Doranrsquos Rock National School, a small two-room country school between Saintfield and Crossgar.When she left school she went to work at the Montalto Estate in Ballynahinch, which was owned by the aristocratic Clanwilliam family.Youngest son Malcolm takes up her story.He said: ldquoIt wasnrsquot long after she began working there when one fine evening she was pushing her bike along the Creevyargon Road toward home, exhausted after a dayrsquos work when she met a young man walking toward her in the other direction.Malcolm explained the young man was so taken by Jean that he offered to push the bike for her.ldquoThe young man was my father, Hugh, and within three years they were married, said Malcolm.Hughrsquos family were dairy farmers from the Creevyargon Road. When the couple got married Jean gave up her job at Montalto, as was customary in those days.Jean and Hugh were to be blessed with six children, three of whom mdash Malcolm and his elder sisters, Irene and Anne mdash are still alive. Two of the children died in infancy and another daughter, Margaret, passed away a few years ago.Jean has been a widow for over  years but her fabulous tapestries and hours spent volunteering at local charity shops are testimony to someone who enjoys being busy. One of her finely embroidered pieces hangs proudly in the nursesrsquo station at Spa Nursing Home.Some years ago, Jean visited northern France and sewed the magnicent medieval monastery of Mont-St-Michel, set in the bay of St Malo where Normandy and Brittany merge.She is also a keen local historian and is particularly knowledgable about Betsy Gray and the Battle of Ballynahinch in .Jean also enjoys John Wayne films, including Rio Bravo and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, and the musical Seven Brides for Seven Brothers which starred Howard Keel.

It is beyond time that we invested in this important part of our economy, creating new jobs and bringing new opportunities to local people.Cllr Curran mdash who invited Mr Poots to visit Ardglass to see the port at first hand mdash said such a visit would provide an opportunity for the fisheries minister to see that the development of the harbour is ldquoessential for the day-to-day lives of people in the village and the economic prosperity of South Down.He said that the local port is home to a large fishing fleet which lands some of the largest quantities of prawns in Ireland. In addition, Cllr Curran explained that Ardglass is the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor.ldquoThe main economic activity in Ardglass is the fishing industry and although it is reasonable buoyant at present, harbour improvement is needed to sustain it., Cllr Curran continued.ldquoThis improvement is required to facilitate the large fish and prawn boats as they have encountered issues with access.Cllr Curran explained that due to their size, a number of vessels have scraped along the sea bed at low tides entering the harbour, causing damage to their hulls which can result in vessels being out of commission for repairs. leading to a loss of earnings.ldquoSome of the larger boats now bypass Ardglass and go where, mainly to Belfast, he continued. ldquoThis results in a loss of landings and additional transport costs to the local fish factories.Cllr Curran added: ldquoIf Ardglass harbour is not deepened, it could potentially lead to an economic collapse for the fishing industry in Ardglass and that is something no one wants to see happening.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is supporting plans to regenerate Ardglass harbour to help secure the future of the villagersquos fishing industry and has provided financial support to a harbour development group which has drawn up a series of proposals.The money was designed to help the group complete a business case aimed at paving the way for a number of projects including deepening the harbour to accommodate larger herring and mackerel vessels and to upgrade berthing facilities for local trawlers.The Ardglass group is also keen to relocate trawlers to the an area known locally as the Saw Pit at the harbour which it wants to deepen in order that vessels are able to put to sea when they want and not have to wait on the right tidal conditions.The provision of a dedicated repair facility for vessels is also a key aim for the new group as currently trawler skippers have to take their boats to Kilkeel or Portavogie which reduces the time they can spend at sea earning a living.Another key plank of the grouprsquos vision for the future is converting property at the harbour to provide a new hub offering essential office and training space. It is also hoped to provide a storage and work area and space for the community to use..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th March 2020 Coronavirus.jpg","title":"Coronavirus: St Patrick’s parade off  ","story":"NEXT Tuesdayrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parade in Downpatrick has been cancelled over the coronavirus threat.Itrsquos only the second time the cross-community carnival has been halted since it was started in the s mdash it was called off in  due to the foot and mouth health crisis.Newry, Mourne and Down Council yesterday confirmed that parades would not go ahead in Downpatrick or Newry after party leaders on the council decided to pull the plug.The council has also cancelled open-air activities in St Patrickrsquos Square, but other events in Down County Museum and Down Arts Centre are going ahead.Chief executive Marie Ward spoke yesterday morning with the DUPrsquos Billy Walker, Sinn Feinrsquos Willie Clarke, UUPrsquos David Taylor and the SDLPrsquos Pete Byrne for their views after Belfast City Council voted to cancel its parade on Monday night.Dublin also cancelled its St Patrickrsquos Day parade, the largest event held on the island.A council spokesperson said the decision was made ldquoin consultation with party leaders and is in line with the recent cancellations of St Patrickrsquos Day parades where.The spokesperson added: ldquoThe council appreciates the negative impact this decision may have on local businesses at this time, however this decision has been taken as a precaution given our membersrsquo and the publicrsquos concern around the coronavirus response.The townrsquos religious ceremonies are to go ahead as planned.A service of Holy Communion in St Patrickrsquos Church of Ireland Church at Saul will be held at .am.The traditional mass in Irish and the distribution of shamrock will take place in St Patrickrsquos Church at am and the cross-community service will take place in Down Cathedral at .am.The Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, said while he understood peoplersquos concerns, he pointed out that Patrickrsquos Day was also a religious festival and that services would be taking place as normal.ldquoPart of our theme this year is prayer for the country which is very apt at this time, he added.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke was the first politician to call for the event to be cancelled.The Sinn Feacutein man said it was ldquoessential to have an all Ireland response to this epidemic, which is spreading rapidly across Europe.He said: ldquoI believe there is an obligation on myself and all councillors to protect the health and well-being of citizens, given the spread of coronavirus and growing concern amongst the public.He said that the decision was not taken lightly but it was ldquothe responsible thing to do.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoI would like to see an event held at a later dateit is possible, to reschedule these celebrations, as sections of the business community will undoubtedly see a reduction in business, and the British government need to provide resources to mitigate these losses.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker said he felt that there would have been an increased risk to Downpatrickthe parade had have gone ahead as it could have attracted people who normally attended the Belfast event.ldquoWe may have had the situation that we would have increased crowds with increased risk, said Cllr Walker.ldquoI think itrsquos the right decision to take. I completely sympathise with all the council officials and employees who have planned the event, and of course all the community groups who love to take part and who have put in months of hard work with float and costume preparation.ldquoBut at the end of the day we have to think of health and public safety.Council vice-chairman Terry Andrews, of the SDLP, said he fully supported the decision but added ldquothat it was most unfortunate it had to be taken.ldquoCouncillors have done the right thing and itrsquos better to be cautious to minimise any potential risks, he said.South Down MP Chris Hazzard praised the council for its ldquoproactive and responsible leadership to protect our citizens in cancelling the parade.He added: ldquoThere will of course be huge public disappointment and hard-felt financial repercussions for our local retail and hospitality industry. But the health and well-being of our citizens must be the priority for all of us.One of the first associated casualties of the cancelled parade is Downpatrick and County Down Railwayrsquos planned park-and-ride service from Inch Abby to the town centre.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner said he estimated the not-for profit organisation would lose between pound,-pound, in income as a result.ldquoIf therersquos no carnival, therersquos no need for the park and ride, confirmed Mr Gardiner. ldquoWe normally carry about - people into Downpatrick on the day and they nearly all go to the carnival.ldquoWhile we can take this loss of income on the chin at the moment, we would be worriedthis continues as Easter is a very good holiday for us and we enjoyed a very busy summer last year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th March 2020 Crossgar.jpg","title":"Crossgar hosts meeting on future of unionism  ","story":"THE first in a series of meetings to discuss the future of unionism in Rowallane was held last week in Crossgar.Guests included Lagan Valley MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Orange Order Grand Secretary the Rev Mervyn Gibson and victimsrsquo campaigner Sammy Heenan.Organised by Rowallane councillors Kathryn Owen and Billy Walker, Crossgar Orange Order members and Crossgar Young Defenders Flute Band, last weekrsquos meeting has been hailed a great success.Around  people attended the meeting at Crossgar Orange Hall with plans confirmed for another in Saintfield over the coming weeks.Organisers say that they believe that local unionism is in a ldquomuch stronger place following the meeting with organisers thanking all those who took part.Also attending last weekrsquos meeting was Mr John Hanna, chairman of the UUPrsquos Strangfordrsquos Association.Cllr Owen said people spoke ldquoopenly and honestly during the meeting, with concerns voiced by those who attended ldquolistened to and discussed.She admitted while there is work to do across Northern Ireland, she is confident that unionism in Rowallane has taken a step in the right direction.Cllr Walker mdash who described the meeting as ldquoextremely worthwhile mdash thanked everyone who supported the event and encouraged people to attend the next one in Rowallane when the date and venue have been confirmed.ldquoThe turnout was tremendous and there was a lot of rank discussion which is good.

is working to make the forest park one of Northern Irelandrsquos leading tourist attractions mdash has to date secured almost pound, in grant aid towards the cost of the ambitious project.The council has also committed just over poundm of its money to the project with a fresh application for pound.m to be submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund in June, with an anxious wait until September to discover whether the bid has been successful.The funding secured to date has been provided by the Heritage Lottery Fundand Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs .Since the s, the sprawling forest park was the demesne of the Annesley family, who created a beautul landscape and a nationally and internationally important -hectare arboretum.The proposed development project aims to create a new vision for the historic Castlewellan demesne, delivering what is being described as a ldquoheritage-led destination to connect people with their built and natural heritage.Council officials and local politicians are keen to see the picturesque forest parkrsquos Arboretum, Annesley Garden and Grange Buildings redeveloped to help increase the number of visitors and provide the area with an economic boost.Officials say the focus is on improving amenities and the interpretation of the parkrsquos natural and built heritage.A recent economic appraisal recommended the development of what is being described as a welcome centre in the walled garden area designed to provide access via a lt to its upper floor, with the council keen to play a leading role, alongside the Forest Service, to help transform the parkrsquos fortunes and make it even more popular.At Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee, it was confirmed that the council currently holds a -year operating licence for the parkrsquos walking, bike and horse riding trails, in addition to play facilities.In addition, politicians were told that during a workshop in January to discuss the way forward, it was identied that formal links will be required with a number of organisations in relation to the future management of the parkrsquos Bothy Yard, glasshouses and propagation in particular.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is also hoping to secure a lease for the hugely popular park from the Forest Service and confirmed that once funding has been secured and the lease secured, it will pave the way for construction work to start.It has also been confirmed that local people will be asked for their views on the redevelopment of the forest park with public consultation on the way forward to be held sometime next month. Two previous consultation exercises have already been held.Councillors were told on Monday that the local authority may be asked to provide additional funding for the forest park development,the level of funding being sought from the Heritage Lottery Fund is not secured.They also agreed to investigate the potential of developing a partnership arrangement with Annes Grove in Cork which boasts an th century house and early th century garden, the latter of which includes a woodland garden with an interesting collection of rhododendrons, river garden, walled garden, wild-flower meadow and lily pond.Council officials believe there is merit for a joint marketing exercise involving Annes Grove and the Castlewellan park, alongside the propagation of trees and shrubs and student exchanges.Also on Monday, councillors granted permission for local authority officials to develop expressions of interest in vacant space at the forest park and hope that work to make one of the nest even better can get underway within months.Council officials say while they recognise the parkrsquos undoubted heritage signicance, parts of it require investment to preserve them and help promote an area which has

ends Strangford cup dream  ","story":"THERE was to be no fairytale cup ending for Strangford when Ballynagross ruled the roost in Friday nightrsquos NFU Mutual Harry Clarke Cup semi-final at Bignian Park.Philip Campbellrsquos side displayed a ruthless streak when they brushed aside their giantkilling neighbours to book their place in the Easter Monday showdown for the third year in a row and they can now prepare for a massive derby clash with Celtic Bhoys.First half goals from twin terrors Daniel Taggart and Declan Dowie sent Ballynagross on their way and Eoin Rooney smashed in an unstoppable third midway through the second half to finally kill off a game Strangford side.In a competitive opening, Ballynagross used the width of the pitch to get at Strangford and with just two minutes gone Dowie had an effort cleared off the line after a cross from Rooney threatened to cause damage.Five minutes later Rooney had an effort hacked away to safety by an alert Conan Hynds as Ballynagross threatened to run riot.However, Donnie Ritchie started to get a few tackles in and his physicality in the engine room enabled Strangford to mount a few attacks of their own, using Conall Magee and Eoin King as willing outlets.Darting runs from Hynds and Ritchiersquos no-nonsense approach was just the ticket for Strangford and with  minutes gone Patrick Kerr had the ball in the back of the net only for it to be harshly ruled out for offside.Two minutes later at the opposite end, Cultra again saved from Rooney and followed that up with another good stop to deny Dowie.Strangford were becoming increasingly confident as teenage defenders Fionn McFaul and Thomas Fitzsimons settled into the job and with Ritchie and Hynds rattling a few cages, Niall Hyndsrsquo side started to look the part.However, they were left crestfallen in the th minute when Dowie broke free on the right and crossed for Taggart to flash a ing header into the net, somewhat against the run of play.It was a cruel blow for Strangford, but things were about to get worse, much worse.Referee Aide Sharvin who had a good game, had the whistle in his mouth to blow for half-time when the influential Connor McCarron sent Dowie clear and with the Strangford back four caught flat-footed, he lobbed the ball over Cultra with the last kick of the half to make it -.Strangford knew they had no choice but to throw caution to the wind after the break and that they did, but Aaron Beattie and Conor Marron gave absolutely nothing away at the back for Ballynagross and chances were hard to come by.Ballynagross were now able to hit Strangford on the break and with  minutes gone Cultra pulled off a stunning save to deny the overlapping Tom McNeill and then John Shields on the follow-up.With  minutes gone King blasted wildly over the top for Strangford before Ballynagross were denied what looked a stonewall penalty when Cultra emptied Rooney as he darted into the penalty box, but the referee waved play on.Ballynagross were not to be denied their third goal and with  minutes gone Shields played a delightful ball into the path of Rooney and from the right hand side of the box he unleashed a vicious volley that had goal written all over it from the moment it left his boot.Strangford still refused to throw in the towel and apart from a double save from close in by Cathail Arnold, they never really threatened, despite seeing their fair share of possession.Ballynagross could have won by a bigger margin, but Cultra stood big and tall and kept the final tally down with several more good saves.Ballynagross: Cathail Arnold, Tom McNeill, Deaglan Craig, Connor Marron, Aaron Beattie, Conor McCarron, Cormac Byrne, John Shields, Daniel Taggart, Eoin Rooney, Declan Dowie.

But politicians make decisions, based on instinct, mandate and advice – or should do. Civil servants hardly helped themselves by not recording their advice to politicians.

They are playing party politics with health and that is utterly reprehensible.”Mr Aiken said the Sinn Fein stance “could make a bad situation far worse,” and added: “People should ignore Sinn Fein and follow the advice of professionals.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He made me feel very relaxed, said one patient after meeting Charles.ldquoWithin  seconds I felt at ease. It was nice to be able to say what you wanted, and he genuinely had an interest in the patients, said Kathryn Guercio, a Health Care Assistant at Marie Curie.For Kathryn, the royal visit was an opportunity to thank the prince.ldquoWhen I was  I left school with no qualications. I was an absolute angry drop out. I joined the Princes Trust volunteers because they didnrsquot know what  to do with me, Kathryn said.Established by Charles in , the Princes Trust helps vulnerable young people to find employment and gain valuable training.ldquoI did a fortnight of caring in Surry and I loved it. I absolutely loved it. Thatrsquos when I thought I could do this. I just love looking after people.ldquoItrsquos because of that choice to join the Princes Trust volunteers that I ended up where I am, so I genuinely do thank him for taming a very wayward -year-old.Describing her job at Marie Curie, Kathryn said: ldquoI love it here. Therersquos no comparison. You can give that  percent every sht. And wersquove got a cracking view. The sun rises and then the moon rises. We get to see it all across the water. Itrsquos gorgeous.Following the tour, the prince ended his visit at a reception where he met actor and Marie Curie ambassador, Suzanna Packer.In a brief speech, he commended the staff and volunteers for their dedication which he called lsquotruly remarkable.rsquoHe then unveiled a plaque to commemorate his visit and cut a daffodil-themed cake made by local Michelin-starred chef, James Sommerin.Angelina Hall and Cathy OrsquoDoherty, co-owners of Glass By Design at Station Approach, were commissioned to design and produce the plaque.ldquoIt was an honour for us as local artists to be asked to make this, said Cathy. ldquoItrsquos something which is going to be here for people to enjoy.His Royal Highness was also the first person to sign the charityrsquos Great Big Daffodil - a -foot tall model with paper books in the shape of petals which will start a UK wide tour this week.The Great Daffodil Appeal is an opportunity for people to share their stories, memories, or tributes to a loved one.After signing the book and cutting the cake, Charles gave a final farewell to the staff who had gathered to see him and left with his entourage.The prince met with flood victims in Pontypridd later that afternoon.His trip to South Wales also included engagements at the CAF train factory in Newport, the Aston Martin Lagonda factory in St. Athan, Barry, and the British Airways Maintenance Centre in Cardf. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy. None of us know what is going on behind the closed door of either someonersquos home or their mind and whilst I hope you sleep well,you canrsquot, use that time wisely to think, to empathise and to learn. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

As the rain lashed down pretty much all day Friday and the wind did too much howling and yowling for my liking, we went to bed and then awoke to roads that looked like rivers between Sully and Barry and fields resembling lakes in Dinas Powys.My son and I played lsquospot the tops of the treesrsquo as we drove a erted route to get to his football match on Saturday morning and discussed climate change and the power of nature atas we drove through sun, hail, wind, and rain to get him to his match.The third weekend of storms has taken its toll. It feels tiring and worrying to be soaked once more.But it occurred to me as we left the house early and crawled along with other erted drivers that just a few miles up the road in Pontypridd and indeed in other parts of Wales and across the UK, people are witnessing their homes and business, their lives, being washed away and so as irritated and fed up as I may have been, I scrabbled for perspective.Perspective is a tough one. There will always be someone worse off and someone better off and whilst you can sympathise and empathise and seek to understand, you can only really know your own lived experience.But this is in part why I am so interested in the news, because in dealing with, embracing, enduring, revelling in my own le, I appreciate that window on the world to open my mind, teach me things and remind me that there are others in similar, same, better and much worse situations than me. It doesnrsquot stop a flooded road being frustrating, but it does remind me that in the midst of chuntering and muttering, because I do indulge in a chunter and mutter, thatpossible, it is important to take a moment to think about a world outside ourselves and our immediate surrounds.It can feel depressing. It is easy to feel powerless. But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The aim is that these virtues help to form them.With such a vast space at its disposal, the school ensures that children are given a rich and versatile experience.In the orchard, pupils pick fruit from pear, apple, plum, and damson trees which they use in cooking lessons during the autumn.They also grow  dferent kinds of fruit, salad, and vegetables in a polytunnel.Earlier this year, St Josephrsquos Primary was awarded a gold award in the UNICEF Rights Respecting School programme.The award is granted to schools which show a commitment to promoting childrenrsquos rights and raising awareness of these amongst young people.It recognises efforts to place the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child at the heart of a schoolrsquos policies and practice.ldquoAlongside our work on rights is the fact that we want our children to be aware of their responsibilities, said Mr Rein.ldquoYes, they have rights to be heard, but they also have a responsibility to listen to others.St Josephrsquos was the first school in Wales to develop a pupil parliament.Every child is a member of the parliament, and elected representatives from eight student groups form a cabinet which has decision-making powers.ldquoThe school parliament is a vehicle for the pupils to have a voice, so they can decide how the school can be a better place, how the local community can improve, and how we can help the UN to achieve their global goals, continued Mr Rein.ldquoSo the children are looking inward ndash at themselves and how the school environment can improve ndash and looking outward at how we can develop better links with the parishes and the areas of Penarth and Dinas Powys.ldquoOur Eco Ministry has been involved in a project to tidy beaches and pick up plastic, and our Healthy Schools and School Mission team have given food to local foodbanks.St Josephrsquos Primary is one of  innovation schools which have been chosen to contribute to the Welsh Governmentrsquos new curriculum framework, which will be rolled out to every school in Wales by . As part of the new framework, schools are required to design their own curriculum based upon the needs of specic learners, rather than adhering to a national learning program.St Josephrsquos curriculum is lsquoresearch-ledrsquo, meaning it is based on findings in child development and cognitive science.Teachers have undertaken training on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop, and lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social, and physical development.Mr Rein said: ldquoWe want our children to develop physically in terms of their gross motor skills, their fine motor skills, and their locomotion skills.ldquoWe have apparatus on which they can hang, climb, and swing, to build up their core strength.Mr Rein called the schoolrsquos curriculum lsquoreally ambitions.rsquoldquoWe are one of sixteen innovation schools in Wales helping to implement the new curriculum and develop special projects to do with the curriculum, he said.ldquoWe have taken that on by focusing on a knowledge-rich curriculum, so that we develop childrenrsquos knowledge, skills, and give them fantastic experiences.ldquoWe have taken good, rich materials from lots of dferent places, and developed some of our own, which we have implemented to a high standard.ldquoBehaviour in the school is exemplary partly because we have spent a long time asking what good teachers do.ldquoWe practice together as staff, so our teachers are working at a high level using a very well-researched curriculum.In last yearrsquos maths reasoning test,  per cent of pupils at St Josephrsquos scored higher than the national average, and  per cent of pupils scored above average in the National Reading TestldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos, said Mr Rein.ldquoEverything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.The schoolrsquos curriculum has recently been praised by cabinet member for education and regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, who said St Josephrsquos had done a lsquobrilliant job.rsquoShe said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning.ldquoIt encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here. Manufacturing Month NI, led by Manufacturing NI, will run for the entire month of March. It will include a series of events, business breakfasts, seminars, workplace tours, and the flagship annual Anchor High leadership summit will be held across Northern Ireland to highlight local manufacturing success stories, address major challenges as we enter the new decade, and inspire the next generation of manufacturers and engineers. The event, sponsored by KPMG, Siemens, Willis Towers Watson, Barclays, and Invest NI, Manufacturing Month NI will bring together industry leaders, politicians and policy experts, young people and schools, and other business leaders to celebrate manufacturers and engineers, and explore and discuss the challenges which face the industry in Northern Ireland. “We are very pleased to be launching the inaugural Manufacturing Month NI, taking place this March,” Stephen Kelly, chief executive, Manufacturing NI, said. “The manufacturing sector in Northern Ireland is the foundation of our regional economy. Manufacturing Month is a celebration of the great people, in great local companies, making great products used at home and around the world. From food processing and pharmaceuticals to aeronautical technology and new, emerging tech like AI and machine learning, Northern Ireland punches well above its weight when it comes to producing world-class products and services.” “This new initiative not only celebrates the people who make our manufacturing sector the world leader that it is but will create a legacy and a pathway for the next generation of sector leaders. A key feature of Manufacturing Month NI will be a major outreach and engagement programme with schools and regional colleges, focused on promoting the sector to young people, developing the crucial skills they need as they enter the industry.” “We hope to see as many companies as possible across theand breadth of Northern Ireland get involved with Manufacturing Month NI. We are keen to highlight new products, new initiatives, workplace tours, business expansion, and everything  in between to showcase the strength and quality of our local manufacturing sector.” And Economy Minister, Diane Dodds, said: “I commend Manufacturing NI for this new initiative which celebrates one of Northern Ireland’s most vital sectors.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
