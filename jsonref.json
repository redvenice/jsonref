[{"url":null,"title":"MAIL SUNDAY COMMENT fool panic task real leader calm","story":"Share this article There has been much speculation that it is more virulent, that it spreads more quickly than the widespread Delta variant, and even that existing vaccines might prove ineffective against it. But in fact this is all guesswork.There simply has not been enough time to establish any of these things. While we wait to know, measured and targeted precautions are sensible.They are relatively easy to remove if they prove to be needless, and equally easy to retain if they are justified. It is not as if we cannot react quickly to any crisis, when it comes.If any of these dangers turns out to be real, we have in this country a superb vaccine research capacity, and we have demonstrated the ability to respond with great speed and efficiency when called to do so.By contrast, a renewal of restrictions on work and daily life would be enormously difficult to lift once imposed, as experience clearly shows. There would be so many voices warning that it was too soon to take the risk, so Ministers would hesitate endlessly. It could be months before we were again free of such curbs.So calls from some quarters for the return of restrictions to our national life should be treated with caution. We now know that such measures carry a heavy price tag.The NHS will take many months to recover from the effects on it of the last lockdown, when vast numbers of people missed vital treatments and tests. The mental health of the old and lonely has already taken enough blows. How dismal it would be for them to be stuck in a renewed lockdown, especially at a time of year when so many look forward to family gatherings around the Christmas tree.The economy is now bursting into full life again, but this is largely because of Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u0027s bold and praiseworthy decision to liberate the country from shutdowns and closures at the earliest sensible moment.It is as well to remember that many criticised this decision. Yet other countries that retained tight restrictions have in fact suffered from redoubled outbreaks of the disease, whereas the English figures, for now, remain gratifyingly low.As winter gets under way with all its dangers to health, it may be hard to argue that Mr Johnson\u0027s policies have solved the problem. But it is far harder to argue that they have failed, or proved to be rash.We have our freedom back. Our economy is booming, education is at last returning to normal, daily life is resuming, the Health Service is working hard to catch up with its backlog, growing numbers have been able to take foreign holidays and fly abroad to see long-missed relatives.The time may come when there is good reason to sacrifice all these gains. If it does, then we will be the first to support them.But let us not rush into any such action. Any fool can panic, but the task of the real statesman is to be calm."},{"url":null,"title":"Chinese CCTV monitoring Britons 275 000 networks identified five Uighur camps","story":"Share this article London holds the largest number at 61,504, followed by Birmingham with 8,865, Manchester with 7,436 and Liverpool with 4,957, according to researchers at TOP10VPN. Last week it emerged that the Government is using hundreds of Hikvision cameras across the Department for Health, Department for Work and Pensions, and Ministry of Justice. This is despite a Freedom of Information request by the campaign group Free Tibet that uncovered official Ministry of Defence guidance warning \u0027not to use  install Hikvision equipment\u0027. And last week the MoS revealed the Home Office had faced a security scare after discovering a CCTV unit in its London HQ manufactured by Dahua. Authorities in the US fear the companies\u0027 camera technology present a national security concern because of their links to the Chinese state, which the firms\u0027 bosses strongly deny. Both Hikvision and Dahua\u0027s cameras and technology has been used in the repression of the Muslim minority Uighurs in China. Conservative MP Alicia Kearns, of the China Research Group, said: \u0027I have been calling for the UK government to ban Hikvision and Dahua cameras for months - not least stripping it from Government departments and local councils. \u0027This is yet more evidence why we urgently need to rip this insidious technology from our country to protect our civil liberties. \u0027It is unacceptable for even a penny of taxpayers\u0027 money to go to an arm of the Chinese state, one actively facilitating the genocide of the Uighur people in Xinjiang.\u0027 Earlier this month the Government brought its revised camera surveillance code before Parliament but failed to include a human rights clause blocking the purchase of equipment from firms linked to human rights abuses. Fraser Sampson, England and Wales\u0027s Biometric and Surveillance Camera Commissioner, said: \u0027From what little they\u0027ve said publicly it seems Hikvision would like to adopt a \u0027fire and forget\u0027 approach and disown any responsibility for what is done with their systems once they\u0027ve designed and installed them.\u0027 Hikvision supplies CCTV cameras to British schools, police forces, government departments, local councils, hospitals, care homes and private companies. Hikvision declined to comment while Dahua did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"Priti Patel doing two years prevent Channel crossings","story":"Share this articlePriti Patel’s fury as bitter blame game breaks out over Channel migrant deaths | News | The Sunday Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Covid Australia TWO confirmed cases Omicron Sydney","story":"Share this articleCall for five-day mandatory hotel quarantine to stop omicron"},{"url":null,"title":"step up the artist fixated on feet in pictures","story":"You may be relieved to hear that, although she has a collection of “magical” secondhand shoes, Litovka mainly wears trainers. “In my normal life it’s about the eyes and being an artist, not my feet.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e2a0a158231324897903cc75e5672fba2a7a81a/0_256_5532_3320/master/5532.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=afcce3dbf3af5b0cc256b945ad6b76da","title":"covid live news uk germany and italy detect omicron cases israel bans all visitors","story":"Dr Paul Burton said: “I think we have cause to be hopeful, we’ve learnt a lot about this virus in general. “You know, we’ve learned so much about how to deal with Covid as well, through simple measures, and obviously through vaccines, but until we see how this virus now behaves in populations of older people, people with other comorbidities. We really want to get a handle on exactly how severe the disease could be, I think.” He added: “This is a dangerous-looking virus, but I think we have many tools in our armamentarium now to get to fight it, so I’m optimistic.” Dr Burton said researchers will have a better idea about the effectiveness of the current vaccines against Omicron in the “next couple of weeks”, but if a new vaccine is required that could be produced on a large scale by early 2022.Sturgeon told the Andrew Marr programme on BBC1 that the variant, which originated in southern Africa, had not yet been detected in Scotland. But she added: “I’m asking people to behave in Scotland just now as if it is present.” She said tougher restrictions, including on travel, could be needed if the variant caught hold. The Scottish government has already matched all the restrictions on travel from southern Africa introduced by the UK government for English airports last week. “I think we may need to go further to restrict travel in the next few days,” she said. “I think we need to be open minded to doing anything to keep the population safe right now.” She said that “on the upside”, health experts and ministers knew what to do in these situations, and the vaccines were still effective at limiting its spread and its ill-effects. She urged people to take up vaccines and booster jabs.Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, told The Andrew Marr Show she first encountered the variant in a man in his early 30s who presented with tiredness and a mild headache, but none of the usual coronavirus symptoms. She said: “What we are seeing clinically in south Africa, and remember I’m at the epicentre - that’s where I’m practising - it’s extremely mild. For us, that’s mild cases.” When asked if the UK was “panicking unnecessarily”, she said: “I think you already have it there in your country and you’re not knowing it, and I would say, yes, at this stage I would say definitely. “Two weeks from now maybe we will say something different.”Speaking to Trevor Phillips On Sunday on Sky News, Lisa Nandy said her party will consider the plans in Parliament on Monday but there are “a number of outstanding holes in our defences” that need to be addressed. Asked if she accepts the Government’s strategy laid out on Saturday, she said: “There is a balance to be struck, I think the Health Secretary is right about that. “We don’t think the Government has been getting the balance right up to now. That’s why we support the measures to bring in greater use of masks, mandatory masks in some settings, and we’ll be asking questions about whether the scientific basis for that suggests that that needs to go further. “We desperately want to see them tighten up the travel restrictions. There is a real problem when for 18 months the Government has been warned that there are holes in those defences and still hasn’t taken action to plug what you rightly suggested are just practical measures that could be dealt with in order to stop the new variant spreading around the country.”Speaking to Trevor Phillips on Sky, Sajid Javid said that following the news of a new variant: “I do think people will take this more seriously.” He added that people should make plans for Christmas “as normal” amid questions about another lockdown. Javid said: “I think it’s fair to say that the nature of this pandemic is it would be irresponsible to make guarantees. “As for Christmas, I think people should continue with their plans as normal for Christmas, I think it’s going to be a great Christmas.”A traveller who returned from South Africa last week tested positive for COVID-19 with indications of the new variant, though confirmation requires further sequencing over the coming days, Tirol authorities said in a statement. South Africa’s discovery of the variant has sparked global concern, a wave of travel bans or curbs and a sell-off on financial markets on investor fears that it could stall recovery from the pandemic. Cases were detected in several European countries on Saturday, including Italy and Germany. Austria had already powered down public life last Monday with its fourth national coronavirus lockdown, becoming the first western European country to reimpose the unpopular measure this autumn owing to surging COVID-19 infections.Sajid Javid said that mandatory mask wearing on public transport and in shops would come into force on Tuesday in a “temporary” measure in response to the new strain. Speaking to Trevor Phillips on Sky said the government’s approach was “proportionate and balanced”, but said the impact of the variant on vaccines was not yet known. He said: “There is reason to think that maybe, and I stress the word may, that this variant may turn out to make our vaccines less effective, it may not. We just don’t know enough.  “We will learn to live with this.” Javid said that even if Omicron makes vaccines less effective it was still expected to make only a “small impact”.The professor of molecular oncology at the University of Warwick said it is a “shame” the measures introduced by Boris Johnson do not go as far as to advise people to work from home and use vaccine passports. Speaking to Times Radio, he said: “I think what we’re looking at at the moment is what I call ‘Plan B lite’. It’s a shame that we’re just not going a little bit further. “That’s not about lockdowns, but it’s about encouraging people to work from home where possible and thinking about how we, you know, dare I say, use some form of vaccine passport just to make sure that we’re all safe. “So, what we heard yesterday, and what’s likely to happen over the next few weeks, is a watered-down version of Plan B and the hope is that that will be sufficient so we don’t end up in a really difficult situation at Christmas.”Travellers who arrived from these countries over the past two days will have to undergo 14 days of quarantine.You can read Michael Savage’s full story here: Both passengers arrived from southern Africa on Saturday evening, and underwent testing last night. Both cases are asymptomatic and in isolation at special health accommodation, and both are fully vaccinated.On Friday, Switzerland banned direct flights from South Africa and the surrounding region due to the detection of a new COVID-19 variant, while also imposing restrictions on travel from other countries including Hong Kong, Israel and Belgium. Entry from those countries would only be possible for Swiss citizens or those with a residence permit in Switzerland or the broader Schengen area. Now, following the detection of new Omicron cases, travellers from Britain, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Egypt and Malawi will need to present a negative COVID-19 test and quarantine for ten days as well, the Federal Office of Public Health said in a tweet. PNG has officially confirmed almost 35,000 coronavirus cases and 542 deaths but it is believed many more cases and deaths are going unreported in the nation of nine million where vaccination hesitancy is reported to be high."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Scientists fear key attitudes may change if climate change worsensStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"nphet meeting to monitor omicron variant and considering further measures","story":"British prime minister Boris Johnson has announced fresh measures to curb the spread of coronavirus after two cases of the Omicron variant were detected in the country.  Video: 10 Downing StreetSouth Africa: Travel restrictions were reintroduced on Friday in a push to contain a new strain of Covid as the WHO designated the Omicron variant as being of concern. Photograph: Kim LudbrookThe Nphet Epidemiological Team is meeting regularly this weekend to monitor the developing Omicron variant situation in Europe and is “considering further required measures”, the Department of Health said in a statement this evening.On Saturday night, the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) said it was aware of new cases of Omicron in the UK, Italy, Germany and Belgium even though it has not been formally notified by European Alert Systems as yet.“The Nphet Epidemiological Team are meeting regularly over the weekend to monitor the situation and are currently considering further required measures,” it said.It added that a series of initial measures have been put in place to mitigate against the arrival of this variant to Ireland.“The situation regarding this new variant will be kept under continuous review by all relevant bodies.”Measures currently in place include the emergency brake for travel to and from the seven countries of concern in respect of the variant.The Department of Foreign Affairs has changed its travel advisory to “avoid non-essential travel” to these countries. Irish residents returning home from these countries will be required to undergo strict home quarantine regardless of vaccine status or recovery status. They will also need to undergo PCR testing during quarantine.“Regulations are being drawn up urgently to give effect to the new travel and home quarantine policies,” said the Nphet statement.“The Department of Justice is arranging increased BMU spot-checking of passengers on arrival.”Nphet also confirmed that mandatory hotel quarantine options are being examined on a contingency basis.UK requirementsThe Irish Government is to review the steps taken by the UK government against the new Covid-19 Omicron variant, which requires all travellers entering the state take a PCR test by the second day of arrival.A Government source said that all responses to the variant were under review including the UK’s response announced by prime minister Boris Johnson on Saturday.A series of meetings will be held in the coming days to address the public health challenges posed to Ireland by the Omicron variant, first discovered in South Africa.The source said that advice was not to follow the UK lead for the moment but to await the outcome of a series of high-level discussions over the next few days on the best approach. That might include a decision to follow the UK’s lead requiring all incoming passengers to take a PCR test upon arrival and self-isolate until they receive a negative result. However, that possibility has yet to be discussed by senior ministers and public health advisers.It is also understood that work is also being done this weekend on a new passenger locator form for people arriving into Irish territory. This will ensure that the original place of travel is included in the form. None of the seven countries in Southern Africa which originally notified cases of the new variant have direct flights into Ireland.It comes following the announcement that legislation is being prepared to reintroduce mandatory hotel quarantine. Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said on Saturday it would be the first item on the agenda at the Cabinet meeting next Tuesday.‘Emergency brake’On Friday, the Irish Government followed the European Union in agreeing to implement an “emergency brake” on arrivals from seven southern African countries.Mr Ryan also said the Department of Foreign Affairs was working with a “small number” of people in southern Africa who were trying to get back to Ireland following the travel restrictions.Mr Ryan said there were limited options available for people with the airlines and the department was looking at chartering a plane to repatriate these people.Mr Ryan said news of the Omicron variant was a shock and one of the most disheartening recent developments in the pandemic.“I’ll be honest, I was frightened yesterday. It was a blow. I was thinking if we get these boosters out in the next few weeks we’ll be in better shape, and we will.”He said it was not clear yet if this new variant was more transmissible or was able to bypass some of the protections offered by vaccines.Asked if the Cabinet would consider other restrictions in addition to mandatory quarantine, Mr Ryan said the truth was that a lot of what has been done will have to be continued.Under the restrictions announced on Friday, people arriving into Ireland from South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini and Mozambique will have to present “not-detected” pre-flight PCR result, regardless of vaccination status, and quarantine at home for 10 days, undergoing a further two PCR tests.Sinn Féin’s health spokesman David Cullinane said it was accepted the Omicron variant was a real concern and there was a need to move fast.A spokesperson for the department said it was providing consular assistance to Irish citizens who had requested it.

But the gap between our positions is still significant and we are ready to use Article 16 to protect the Belfast Agreement if other solutions cannot be found,” Mr Frost said in a statement after meeting European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic in London on Friday.“A decisive push is needed to ensure predictability,” Mr Sefcovic said on Twitter after the meeting with Mr Frost. “We’ll meet again next week.” The two sides are seeking to break the deadlock over the implementation of the protocol, which covers the special trading arrangements designed to prevent Brexit creating a hard border re-emerging on the island of Ireland. EU and Irish officials had been concerned that the British government was moving towards triggering Article 16 earlier this month, but momentum appeared to dissipate as the EU warned it would have a severe impact on trade and UK prime minister Boris Johnson faced political trouble at home over a sleaze scandal.Talks between officials from both sides on technical aspects of customs and other arrangements are due to continue throughout the coming week.The EU has been keen to nail down a deal covering medicines, but has found agreement from the UK side to be elusive.There are concerns that time is tight and that a deal on medicines would need to be reached soon in order for the EU to change its laws in time to avoid disruption after the end of this year.A grace period for border checks and regulatory approvals for medicines is due to expire at the end of December and the EU had proposed adjusting its rules to counter any potential disruption to supply.But in order to be in place by the end of the year, the EU had hoped to begin its internal approval procedures in the coming week.Earlier this week, Mr Sefcovic warned that his previously expressed hopes that a deal could be reached before January were “probably too ambitious”.“I think that if there was the clear political will from the UK side these... problems could be solved,” he told Politico. “But looking at how far we progressed over the last four weeks, the level of detail our UK partners want to discuss, I know that we will probably not be able to resolve everything before the end of the year.” How is Brexit affecting you?

Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillPolitical Correspondent Green Party leader Eamon Ryan has said that emergence of new variants will mean that, for the foreseeable future, Irish people will have “to learn to live with Covid-19 pending a successful global eradication campaign”. In his keynote address to the party’s annual convention, Mr Ryan began by speaking of the new variant of concern that has emerged in southern Africa in recent days, saying it was a worrying development but that it would ultimately be addressed by vaccines.“I know the TV news bulletins might be alarming but please remember that there are several reasons to remain hopeful,” Mr Ryan, who is also Minister for Climate Change, Communications and Transport told delegates.“While the new variant may prove to be more contagious, our best scientists expect that the vaccines will still provide us with protection. What we need to do now is to accelerate the booster programme here at home, and ensure the whole world gets access to vaccines at urgent speed. The only way to stop this disease in its tracks is to have a co-ordinated global approach,” he said.He said the people would have to learn to live with Covid until the worldwide vaccination campaign had completed.However, he said that people would have to be allowed “to enjoy a normal social life because that too is vital for our health and wellbeing”.The party’s intention had been to hold this year’s convention in the Aviva Stadium but it migrated online once the Government’s advice changed earlier this month in the face of the deteriorating Covid-19 situation.Green policiesThe main theme of Mr Ryan’s speech, and also that of deputy leader Catherine Martin, was that the time for action on Green policies in Government is now. He said that not alone had Green policies been approved by the Government, but they were beginning to be implemented.“We are talking the talk but increasingly we are walking the walk,” he said. “There are challenges ahead, of course. Will there be missteps along the way? Absolutely.“But we will learn as we go and we will emerge as a cleaner, greener, happier Ireland. We can do this and we will. The time is now,” he said.In her speech, Ms Martin said the Greens in Government must move faster and be more courageous in their actions.“Institutions, by their nature, don’t change quickly, but the Green Party knows and recognises the urgency to change course.“The old system is built for the old world. It cannot be business as usual.“And if our institutions can’t get what needs to be done, then let’s never accept no for an answer,” said Ms Martin, who is also Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media.She said that the world needed new visions, new leaders and change-makers.She said the Green Party needed to constantly push the boundaries and challenge the status quo.She also said people were demanding the Greens “must do better”.Mr Ryan and Ms Martin argued that the Green Party had achieved a lot in its first 18 months in Government in all of its key areas, including climate change, the environment, bioersity, the arts and tourism (including supports during Covid), children, housing and health.Now, I know there are some people at home who may not share the Green Party’s passion for climate action and who wonder whether it’s all worth it,” said Mr Ryan in his address.“For those listening at home, let me say that the risk isn’t from taking action – the real risk is from standing back and doing nothing at all.Transition“For this new green economy is the one that is emerging across the world. It is an inevitable transition because under business as usual, the world will simply burn…“It is a transition requiring such scale and speed that it needs every person and every place to be involved, which is one of the reasons we have to make sure it is a just transition.”In terms of action, Mr Ryan said a million euro would be spent on active travel every day. He said there would be proposals brought to the Government in the next few weeks to electrify the Maynooth rail line and to order 95 battery electric train carriages for Irish Rail. He said the Bus Connects and Dublin  projects will be brought to Cabinet in the first quarter of next year.He said that under new clean-air regulations there would be no further sales of inefficient solid home-heating fuels from next autumn and that auctions for offshore wind would begin about the same time.“This isn’t all just aspiration by the way, we are already doing this.“We are world leaders at integrating renewable electricity and are well placed to deliver the solar and wind power we have in abundance,” he said.

Photograph: Philipp Guelland EPAThe Omicron variant of the coronavirus has appeared in an increasing number of European countries, leaving governments around the world scrambling to stop the spread.The UK on Saturday tightened its rules on mask-wearing and on testing of international arrivals after finding two cases.New cases were also confirmed in Germany and Italy, with Belgium, Israel and Hong Kong also reporting that the variant has been found in travellers.In the US, Dr Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious diseases expert, said he would not be surprised if the Omicron variant was already in the country.“We have not detected it yet, but when you have a virus that is showing this degree of transmissibility . . . it almost invariably is ultimately going to go essentially all over,” Dr Fauci said on NBC television.Because of fears that the new variant has the potential to be more resistant to the protection offered by vaccines, there are growing concerns around the world that the pandemic and associated lockdown restrictions will persist for far longer than hoped.Nearly two years since the start of the pandemic that has claimed more than 5 million lives around the world, countries are on high alert.Many have already imposed travel restrictions on flights from southern Africa as they seek to buy time to assess whether the Omicron variant is more transmissible than the current dominant delta variant.In England, prime minister Boris Johnson said it was necessary to take “targeted and precautionary measures”, such as increased mask-wearing, after two people tested positive for the new variant.He told a news conference: “Right now this is the responsible course of action to slow down the seeding and the spread of this new variant and to maximize our defences.”The British government also added four more countries — Angola, Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia — onto the country’s travel red list from Sunday.Six others — Botswana, Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe — were added on Friday.Many countries have slapped restrictions on various southern African countries over the past couple of days, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, the EU, Iran, Japan, New Zealand, Thailand and the US, in response to warnings over the transmissibility of the new variant.This goes against the advice of the World Health Organisation (WHO), which has warned against any overreaction before the variant was thoroughly studied.Despite the banning of flights, there are mounting concerns that the variant has already been widely seeded around the world.Italy and Germany were the latest to report confirmed cases of the Omicron variant.An Italian who had travelled to Mozambique on business landed in Rome on November 11th and returned to his home near Naples.He and five family members, including two school-age children, have since tested positive, the Italian news agency LaPresse said. All are isolating in the Naples suburb of Caserta in good condition with light symptoms.Italy’s health ministry is urging all regions to increase its tracing of the virus and sequencing to detect cases of the new variant first identified in South Africa.Australia confirmed on Sunday that two people arriving from southern Africa over the weekend had tested positive for the Omicron variant. Health officials in New South Wales, the most populous state, said both passengers had arrived in the state capital, Sydney, on Saturday evening and tested positive for Covid-19 late that night, before genome sequencing confirmed the Omicron variant on Sunday.In Germany, the Max von Pettenkofer Institute, a Munich-based microbiology centre, said the Omicron variant was confirmed in two travellers who arrived on a flight from South Africa on November 24th.The Dutch public health institute said the Omicron variant was “probably found in a number of the tested persons” who were isolated after arriving on Friday in Amsterdam on two flights from South Africa.The institute said in a statement that further sequencing analysis is under way to determine for sure that it is the new variant. The results were expected on Sunday. A total of 61 people were tested.Israel said it detected the new strain in a traveller who had returned from Malawi and was tracing 800 travellers who returned recently from southern African countries.The variant’s swift spread among young people in South Africa has alarmed health professionals even though there was no immediate indication whether the variant causes more severe disease. – APReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Oil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaints"},{"url":null,"title":"israel to ban entry of all foreign visitors in response to omicron variant","story":"Passengers  queue for PCR   at OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg.

Prime minister Naftali Bennett said in a statement that the ban, pending government approval, would last 14 days. Officials hope that within that period there will be more information on how effective Covid-19 vaccines are against Omicron.Meanwhile, Britain, Germany and Italy detected cases of the new Omicron coronavirus variant on Saturday and British prime minister Boris Johnson announced new steps to contain the virus, while more nations imposed restrictions on travel from southern Africa. The two linked cases of the new variant detected in Britain were connected to travel to southern Africa, British health minister Sajid Javid said. Speaking later, Johnson laid out measures that included stricter testing rules for people arriving in the country but that stopped short of curbs on social activity other than requiring mask wearing in some settings. “We will require anyone who enters the UK to take a PCR test by the end of the second day after their arrival and to self-isolate until they have a negative result,” Johnson told a news conference. People who had come into contact with people testing positive for a suspected case of Omicron would have to self-isolate for 10 days and the government would tighten up the rules on wearing face coverings, Johnson said, adding the steps would be reviewed in three weeks. EuropeThe health ministry in the German state of Bavaria also announced two confirmed cases of the variant. The two people entered Germany at Munich airport on November 24th, before Germany designated South Africa as a virus-variant area, and were now isolating, said the ministry, indicating without stating explicitly that the people had travelled from South Africa. In Italy, the National Health Institute said a case of the new variant had been detected in Milan in a person coming from Mozambique. Czech health authorities also said they were examining a suspected case of the variant in a person who spent time in Namibia. Omicron, dubbed a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organisation, is potentially more contagious than previous variants of the disease, although experts do not know yet if it will cause more or less severe Covid-19 compared with other strains. The variant was first discovered in South Africa and had also since been detected in Belgium, Botswana, Israel and Hong Kong. Dutch health authorities have said 61 people who arrived in Amsterdam on two flights from South Africa on Friday tested positive for Covid-19, and tests for the Omicron variant among the people infected were being conducted.About 600 passengers arrived at Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport on the two KLM flights on Friday and then faced hours of delays and testing due to concerns over the new virus variant.Meanwhile, a number of pharmaceutical firms have said they are working to adapt their vaccines in light of the emergence of Omicron.Experts at the WHO said there is early evidence to suggest Omicron has an “increased risk of reinfection” and its rapid spread in South Africa suggests it has a “growth advantage”.Travel curbsAlthough epidemiologists say travel curbs may be too late to stop Omicron from circulating globally, many countries around the world – including the United States, Brazil, Canada and European Union nations – announced travel bans or restrictions on southern Africa on Friday. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and State Department added on Saturday to Washington’s previously announced travel restrictions, advising against travel to eight southern African countries. Also on Saturday, Australia said it would ban non-citizens who have been in nine southern African countries from entering and will require supervised 14-day quarantines for Australian citizens returning from there. Japan said it would extend its tightened border controls to three more African countries after imposing curbs on travel from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Lesotho on Friday. Britain also said it was expanding its “red list” to put travel curbs on more southern Africa countries, while South Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Oman, Kuwait and Hungary announced travel restrictions on southern African nations. South Africa is worried that the curbs will hurt tourism and other sectors of its economy, the foreign ministry said on Saturday, adding the government is engaging with countries that have imposed travel bans to persuade them to reconsider. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"pcr tests required for passengers arriving into uk after omicron variant detected","story":"British prime minister Boris Johnson has announced fresh measures to curb the spread of coronavirus after two cases of the Omicron variant were detected in the country.  Video: 10 Downing StreetBritain’s prime minister Boris Johnson warned the new variant could reduce the effectiveness of vaccines. Photograph: Hollie AdamsPoolAFPGettyBritish prime minister Boris Johnson has announced fresh measures to curb the spread of coronavirus including mandatory masks in shops and PCR tests for travellers entering the UK after two cases of the Omicron variant were detected in the country.Amid mounting global concern over Omicron, named a “variant of concern” by the World Health Organisation on Friday, the prime minister set out a series of steps the UK is taking to maximise its defence against Covid-19.The Irish Government is to review the steps taken by the UK government against the new Covid-19 Omicron variant, which requires all travellers entering the State take a PCR test by the second day of arrival. A source said that advice was not to follow the UK lead for the moment but to await the outcome of a series of high-level discussions over the next few days on the best approach.Speaking at a Downing Street press conference, Mr Johnson said anyone arriving in the UK will be asked to take a PCR test for Covid-19 on the second day and must self-isolate until they provide a negative test.The rules on face coverings in shops and on public transport will also be tightened, he said.Contacts of all confirmed cases of people infected with the Omicron variant will have to self-isolate for 10 days. Health officials are also examining the case for widening access to the booster vaccine programme, he added. The measures will be reviewed in three weeks.Omicron is potentially more contagious than previous variants, although experts do not know yet if it will cause more severe illness. Mr Johnson warned it could reduce the effectiveness of vaccines, as he announced a strengthening of England’s rules after two cases were identified in Nottingham and Brentwood in Essex.Booster campaignIn an effort to slow the spread, Mr Johnson announced “temporary and precautionary” measures to be reviewed in three weeks, alongside an expansion of the vaccine booster campaign.Mr Johnson said he remained confident that this Christmas “will be considerably better than last Christmas”. Asked about the prospect for this year’s festivities, the prime minister said: “We continue to be in a strong position largely thanks to the speed of the vaccine rollout, another booster rollout and I think I’m going to stick with the formula I’ve used before, which is I’m pretty confident to absolutely confident this Christmas will be considerably better than last Christmas.”The measures announced fall short of the government’s plan B, which involves advice to work from home and the use of vaccine passports. However, the UK may need to “face up” to the possibility of further action if the Omicron variant is very transmissible, the UK’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said.He said: “I think we’ll get more information on transmissibility, we’ll get more information on the ability of the vaccines to protect against the virus, but that’s going to take a little bit of time.“At the moment, the models are more ‘if it spreads very fast, of course it’s going to spread very fast and go into a lot of places, and if it spreads less fast it’s going to do so less’.“But if it’s very transmissible and does cause a big escape, then clearly that’s a major issue we have to face up to. But that isn’t what we know at the moment, we need to get that information.”Prof Chris Whitty told the press conference it was “inevitable” the Omicron variant will spread across the world over the next few days. England’s chief medical officer said that while it is clear Omicron is highly transmissible, it is not yet known how effective the vaccine will be as protection against it – but said those who are vaccinated or receive the booster jab will be less likely to become seriously ill.Red listEarlier on Saturday Sajid Javid, the health secretary, announced that the UK was adding four more southern African nations to the travel red list after two cases of the new variant were detected in Nottingham and Brentwood, Essex.The UK Health Security Agency confirmed the cases, which are believed to be connected and linked to travel from southern Africa, after genomic sequencing overnight. The iniduals and their households were ordered into self-isolation and targeted testing was being carried out in areas where they are thought to have been infectious.Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola will face travel restrictions from Sunday. Javid said “this is a real reminder that this pandemic is far from over” as he urged people to get their vaccines, including boosters.“We were concerned from the moment we first identified this new variant,” he added. He said anyone who has travelled in the last 10 days to the countries now on the red list, which also includes South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Namibia, must self-isolate and take PCR tests.The UK is the second European nation to have reported the presence of Omicron after Belgium said it had identified a single case on Friday. In the Netherlands authorities said 61 people tested positive for Covid-19 arriving on two flights from South Africa on Friday. Further tests are under way to determine if any of them had the Omicron variant.It was unclear when the two iniduals in the UK were infected, or their full travel history, as countries scrambled to close their borders to much of southern Africa. Ministers said non-UK and non-Irish residents who have been in Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola in the previous 10 days will be refused entry into England from 4am on Sunday. Those who are permitted to return will be ordered to isolate in a government-approved facility for 10 days.Risk of reinfectionNumerous pharmaceutical firms have said they are working to adapt their vaccines in light of the emergence of Omicron after the WHO warned that preliminary evidence suggests the variant has an increased risk of reinfection and may spread more rapidly than other strains.Commenting on two cases of the Omicron Covid variant being detected in the UK, Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine, Imperial College London, said: “There is no need to get alarmed, but we do need to be prepared and to take rapid action.“It is better to act fast but be prepared to change as new information comes in. Travel restrictions may slow the rate of growth and buy time to establish the important facts about severity, immune evasion, transmission and susceptibility to treatment and prevention.”Openshaw added: “With or without this new variant, Delta is already a crisis in many parts of Europe and still causing a lot of illness and death in the UK, especially in those not vaccinated or in those who do not respond to vaccines.” – Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"contacts omicron variant must isolate","story":"Omicron Covid iant contacts must isolate for  days, eventheyre vaccinatedBoris Johnson has warned anybody in contact with new Covid iant Omnicron will face a  day isolation period, as he ramped up testing for travellers to UK and reintroduced mask-wearingthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video boris-johnson-outlines-new-travel-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:yKhZVMgX,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,blackFridayWidget.linkUrl:https:www.mirror all-about black-friday,blackFridayWidget:true,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,blackFridayWidget.Link:https:get-latest.dev.convrse.media black-fridayblack-friday-widget-v.,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Those who are identied as being at risk will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace, the government said.The Prime Minister said: This is the responsible course of action to slow down the seeding and the spread of this new iant and maximises our defences. A tweet from the PMaposs office said: COVID UPDATE: All contacts of suspected Omicron cases must self-isolate for  days, regardless of their vaccination status. They will be contacted by NHS Test and Trace.  Earlier today officials confirmed the first to Omicron cases in Brentwood, Essex, and Nottingham, forcing the PM to act. In a press conference from Downing Street, he also announced that all arrivals to the UK will face mandatory PCR tests. The Prime Minister added border measures can only ever minimise and delay the arrival of a new iant rather than stop it all together, so all contacts with a suspected case of the new iant will have to isolate for  days, regardless of their vaccination status. We will also go further in asking all of you to help contain the spread of this iant by tightening up the rules on face coverings in shops and on public transport, Mr Johnson said.  While the effectiveness of vaccines against Omicron is currently unclear, Mr Johnson said there are good reasons for believing they will provide at least some measure of protection. He said weaposre going to boost the booster campaign by asking the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationto consider giving boosters to as wide a group as possible as well as reducing the gap between second doses and the booster. Professor Chris Whitty said it is inevitable the Omicron iant will spread across the world over the next few days. Englandaposs chief medical officer said while it is clear Omicron is highly transmissible, it is not yet clear how effective the vaccine will be as protection against it - but said those who are vaccinated or receive the booster jab will be less likely to become seriously ill. Sir Patrick Vallance said vaccine makers are already looking at how they can make them more effective against emerging iants, and that a jab designed to specically target the Omicron iant could be created in about  days.  He told the Downing Street press conference: I think itaposs important to recognise there are three ways in which this can be done and the companies are thinking about this. The first is the boosters will give high enough antibody coverage that actually thataposs going to be enough to cover this. Thataposs the first situation and needs to be tested. But that looks like something that anyway is going to give protection, whether thereaposs more needed on top of that weaposll have to see. The second is that vaccine manufacturers have been producing broader vaccines anyway to get broader coverage across potential new iants. So those are in the pipeline. Then a couple of companies have already said they could tweak their existing vaccines and get a new vaccine out specically against this in about  days. Those are the sort of three scenarios, clearly the one which is the one to really go for now is boost, because it is the case that as you keep boosting the vaccine, you get slightly broader coverage because the immune system knows it needs to get broader. Because the antibody levels are so high, it actually causes enough coverage of other iants to be effective. He added it is expected the iant will spread.

Ron Roberts says the summons is the “final insult” to his partner, Judy Mason after a “catalogue of problems” with the local authority dating back several years. Judy had several chronic health issues and was registered blind and Ron said previous issues with the council involved waiting two years for bathroom renovations on their home.They were also in dispute over Judy’s care package, which Ron told the Liverpool Echo was a huge burden on her le.As a result of the disputes Judy had with Sefton Council, she had refused to pay her Council Tax since .  He said she was “waiting for her day in court” to explain how she felt about the way she was treated by the council and expecting a summons. But in June this year she went in for surgery to remove a toe, and after a number of delays to her surgery due to the pandemic and contracted Covid while in hospital. Ron said: “She was very poorly and she survived it, I used to sit outside the Covid ward in the Royal speaking to her over the phone. It was a very scary time.” Judy was then transferred to Aintree Hospital for rehabilitation, where she suffered a series of bleeds on the brain and died as Ron held her hand on September .  Since then Ron says his “world has fallen apart” and he has struggled to deal with the grief of losing his partner of  years. When he opened a letter addressed to his partner seeking a court summons for Judy’s unpaid council tax it “just added to the devastation.” He said: “It was the final insult to Judy, after everything they put her through. “We were ignored for years by Sefton Council, so she made a stand about how she had been treated and refused to pay Council Tax.  Ron claims Sefton Council had been informed of her death before the letter had been sent out and receiving it has made him “feel like giving up.” He said: “It just feels like the odds were stacked against us and now she’s gone. “We were treated like dirt, Judy was treated like that in le and now she is in her death too. “They were definitely aware she is dead. I’ve made an appointment to speak to someone at the council before the court date.  “It’s so sad, Judy would have gone and given them what for what they’ve done, they’ve never shown us any decency and they still aren’t now. “She was beautul inside and out, I feel lost without her, we were a team, Ron and Judy, and now it’s just Ron. “I have to keep fighting for Judy, she deserved better.” Sefton Council were approached for comment but said they “do not comment on inidual cases.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Council taxSefton Council\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

That would have stopped disgraced ex-Environment and Food Secretary Owen Paterson pocketing £ an hour from a sausage processing firm.And it would also have prevented former Tory PM David Cameron getting £million worth of share options from finance firm Greensill Capital.Billionaire Australian founder Lex Greensill filed for bankruptcy in March after his firm was unable to repay a £million Credit Suisse loan. Labour Deputy leader Angela Rayner will unveil how the party will clean up politicsKeir Starmer becomes PM in a keynote speech to the Institute of Government in London.She will say: “There can be no stronger evidence that the rules are broken than the case of David Cameron. “If the former PM can text everyone in his phonebook to help his dodgy mate Lex Greensill, it is clear the rules themselves are broken. “Forget the revolving door. We have a system where the door is held wide open for former ministers to line their pockets as soon as they leave office.”  At present the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments governs the rules on ex-ministers working in the private sector. But the PM is the only one with the power to order investigations into the conduct of ministers - including himself. Ms Rayner will say: “ACOBA is a completely toothless and ineffective watchdog.” It will be replaced by an independent Integrity and Ethics Commission with powers to ban ministers from lobbying, consultancy or any paid work relating to their government jobs for at least five years after leaving office. And it will be able to impose sanctions such as demanding theof severance pay worth £, and pension entitlements. Ms Rayner accused the Government of “muzzling its own watchdog” after ministers refused to sanction former Tory Chancellor Lord Hammond for lobbying Treasury officials on behalf of OakNorth International Bank which has links to Saudi Arabian funding. ACOBA chair, the former Tory Cabinet minister Lord Pickles, said: “It was not in keeping with the letter or the spirit of the rules for the former Chancellor to contact the Treasury on behalf of a bank which pays for its advice.” But last week Paymaster General Michael Ellis said: “Although we concur with the Committee’s conclusion, we do not believe further sanctions should be taken”.Ms Rayner added: “This is just the latest evidence that Boris Johnson will not tackle the corruption that has engulfed his Government and the Conservative Party.”A source close to Ms Rayner said: “Angela is really serious about cleaning up this mess. “Ministers should serve the public not keep one eye on a cushy lobbying gig for when they leave office.

He also announced all arrivals in the UK would have to take a PCR test by day two after entering the country, and isolate until their results are in. Weaposre not going to stop people travelling, I want to stress that, weaposre not going to stop people travelling, but we will require anyone who enters the UK to take a PCR test by the end of the second day after their arrival and to self-isolate until they have a negative result, he said.  Second, we need to slow down the spread of this iant here in the UK, because measures at the border can only ever minimise and delay the arrival of a new iant rather than stop it all together. We will require all contacts of those who test positive with a suspected case of Omicron to self-isolate for  days regardless of your vaccination status. We will also go further in asking all of you to help contain the spread of this iant by tightening up the rules on face coverings in shops and on public transport. And he said the government would boost the booster campaign, in a bid to fight the iant. He said: We donapost yet exactly know how effective our vaccines will be against Omicron but we have good reasons for believing they will provide at least some measure of protection. If youaposre boosted, your response is likely to be stronger so itaposs more vital than ever that people get their jabs and we get those boosters into arms as fast as possible. The PM said all the new measures would be temporary and reviewed in three weeks.

Mr Javid said masks would become mandatory in shops and on public transport from Tuesday in England, with all international arrivals told to take PCR tests and isolate until they receive the result. All contacts with a suspected case of Omicron will have to isolate for  days - eventhey are double jabbed - as there are fears the new strain may be able to evade existing vaccines. Mr Javid said the Government hoped these changes would be temporary and said people should plan for Christmas as normal.  He told Skyaposs Trevor Phillips on Sunday: I think itaposs fair to say that the nature of this pandemic is it would be irresponsible to make guarantees. As for Christmas, I think people should continue with their plans as normal for Christmas. I think itaposs going to be a great Christmas. Askedthe Government would introduce working from home or social distancing measures, he said: We know now those types of measures do carry a very heavy price, both economically, socially, in terms of non-Covid health outcomes such as impact on mental health. So,one was to make decisions like that they would have to be done very, very carefully and weaposre not there yet, weaposre nowhere near that. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisationhas been asked to look at extending the booster programme to under-s, with advice expected within the next few days. Boris Johnson set out the changes at a hastily-arranged Downing Street press conference on Saturday but he was criticised for being too vague on the details.The PM has resisted imposing plan B of the Governmentaposs Covid winter plan, which also includes ordering people to work from homepossible and vaccine passports.  Shadow Foreign Secretary Lisa Nandy said the Government needs to tighten up travel restrictions. She said questions remain around the scientic advice provided on mask wearing, the very little action on ventilation in public buildings and questions on travel restrictions. Ms Nandy said: The Government is saying everyone has to have a PCR test on day two when they arrive back in the UK, but theyaposre not suggesting pre-departure tests for people before they board flights. Thereaposs no advice for people about travelling back from the airport on public transport and there are very few checks on the PCR tests that are done. So, these are all things that for months the Government has been warned about. But the doctor who discovered the Omicron iant said the UK was panicking unnecessarily and that the symptoms are extremely mild. Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, said she first encountered the iant in a man in his early s who presented with tiredness and a mild headache but none of the usual Covid symptoms. She told the BBC: What we are seeing clinically in south Africa, and remember Iaposm at the epicentre - thataposs where Iaposm practising - itaposs extremely mild. For us, thataposs mild cases. When askedthe UK was panicking unnecessarily, she said: I think you already have it there in your country and youaposre not knowing it, and I would say, yes, at this stage I would say definitely. Two weeks from now maybe we will say something dferent.

However, did you know itaposs not only a literary triumph but a mathematical one too The is according to a YouTuber known as Tibees. In their video, we learn that author Lewis Caroll is actually a pen name for the th century mathematician Charles Dodgson.Originally, Dodgson told the story of Alice in Wonderland to Alice, the daughter of his university college dean. His mathematical work was barely noticed despite writing a couple of books on the subject, and he was much more well known as a fiction writer. Although, Dodgson still found a way to sneak some mathematics into the story, which may not be as easy to notice. In the video, Tibees takes us through the book and points out the exact moment that Alice falls into the rabbit hole. In the book, Alice says: “I’ll tryI know all the things I used to know. Let me see:  times  is  and  times  is . “And  times  is - oh dear! I shall never get to  at that rate!” According to Martin Gardner, a mathematics and science writer who published annotations for the story, there’s a system to Alice’s sums. In short, Alice is adding one every time she does a multiplication by four, andyou keep going this way, you’ll get to  x  which equals . Tibees adds: “Children especially only know their multiplications up to , so she won’t be able to go any further and won’t be able to get to . “This is a nonsense form of multiplication but it sets us up for the nonsense to come.” Next, it’s time to meet Cheshire the cat, a recognisable part of the story that we all know and love. There even seems to be some hidden maths in Cheshire’s famous grin, as Tibees explains in the video. She said: “The grin might be referring to abstract or pure mathematics. It doesn’t necessarily have a cat to go along with it.  “They’re doing it just for the joy of mathematics itself and are living in the abstract world of equations.” Another example is when Alice meets Mock the turtle, who may be introducing the idea of negative numbers when speaking to Alice. They discuss the idea of ‘lessons’, and how they last ten hours on the first day and lessen each day. Alice then asks what happens on the twelfth day, to which Mock quickly changes the subject. Tibees explains: “This is something that also puzzled early mathematicians. In this case, what would happen on the twelfth day. “Would students start to teach the teacher ” Next, the famous mad hatter tea party has three characters present, but the fourth character ‘time’ isn’t present. She explains further: “As a result, the party is forever stuck at tea time going round and round the table. “Now it might be nothing, but the idea of three characters stuck going around and around and not making much sense without time has the same idea of quaternions.” In fairly simple terms, a quaternion is an alternate way to describe orientation or rotations in D space using an ordered set of four numbers The concept was introduced not too long before the story was written, in the video we learn that they consist of ‘three spatial dimensions.’ I, J and K are the imaginary dimensions and the fourth dimension is real, that is time. Tibees explained: “Perhaps at the tea party, the guests were I, J and K, and without time, they don’t really make sense.” There are plenty of other complex examples within the video which hint at hidden maths planted by Lewis Caroll himself. It’s pretty impressive that he manages to write a classic book and incorporate some complicated mathematics in there too. She concludes: “Given the authoraposs background, it does make sense for there to be a little bit of mathematics. “But maybe the nature of this story just lends itself to these interpretations.” It seems like YouTube users were convinced with the analysis, as one commented: “ When Alice just falls down the rabbit hole and drinks from the bottle that shrinks her. She wonderssheaposll just keep getting smaller or go out entirely. “This seems like a reference to limits in calculus.” Another added: “I never realised this! Such a unique way to explain maths to children.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Lewis CarrollYouTubeMaths-Whizz\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jessica has since had five operations, three types of chemotherapy and spent y spells in hospital. Doctors decided she was too weak for any more surgery or chemotherapy and she was sent home from hospital in an ambulance for palliative care. The family of East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, were then told she may only have weeks to live.  Mum Gillian Allum, , and dad Andrew Gibson, , first became concerned when their daughteraposs right eye began moving rapidly from side to side. But initial GP referral to the hospital led to a three or four-month wait for an MRI scan followed by a drop in Jessicaaposs weight and an admission to Wishaw General Hospital in Lanarkshire on July . After an emergency MRI scan at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow, her parents were told there was a large mass in Jessica’s brain and smaller tumours in her spine. She endured three major operations in a week and also began chemotherapy. Andrew, who is an operations manager, said Jessica would be dead nowthey had waited four months for an MRI scan.He wants the NHS prioritise children showing signs of brain tumours. He told the Daily Record : “The MRI scans really need to take place within days rather than months.”Gillian, a business development manager, added: “We need to do more for children who present symptoms like Jessica’s and get their treatment fast-tracked. If the worst-case scenario happens to our daughter, I want to make sure no other family go through this.”  The couple are doing everything they can to get her better, including the use of approved herbal remedies and treatments. They are also speaking with a private consultant in Thailand who specialises in natural medicine.A JustGiving site has been set up to raise £, to support the family and pay for any possible future private procedures.One possibility is cell therapy treatment in a private London clinic, which could cost between £, and £,.

English teacher Hassan Akkad and  other refugees paid Turkish smugglers £, to get them from Izmir, on the country’s Aegean coast, to Greece in . But their flimsy boat began to sink under the weight of too many people, and Hassan jumped overboard to stop it from capsizing. Eventually, the Turkish coastguards plucked the helpless passengers from the water and ed them to Turkey. Among the group were two university professors, an electrical engineer, a belly dancer, eight or nine children and a pregnant woman, who Hassan later learned had lost her baby after the group almost drowned.

He says his own experience is the reason he knows the government’s current approach to the influx of migrants wishing to risk their lives crossing the channel simply will not work.He told the Sunday People : “The government’s focus is on how to deter people from coming in the first place. “Britain doesn’t have a al system where people can claim asylum before risking their lives to get here. It’s a policy of deterrence, not a policy of compassion. “They are trying to remove the pull factors – or send refugees back to France or the country they arrived in Britain from. “This is not the way to treat the most vulnerable people in society – people who are fleeing for their lives.  “What we need is open safe passage, and regular routes for people to claim asylum. But sending people back is not going to solve anything. “This is about addressing long term pull factors, smashing the criminal gangs that treat human beings as cargo and tackling supply chains. Priti should definitely step down. It’s a tough position, butyou are in charge of a big humanitarian issue and you lack compassion, then I don’t think she is the right person to take charge.” Hassan’s incredible journey is detailed in his book called Hope Not Fear.

Mr Johnson also announced on Saturday that mask rules will be mandatory in shops and on public transport, Omicron contacts will have to self-isolate and new arrivals will have to quarantine until they test negative for coronavirus.The press conference was hastily arranged after infections were identied in Nottingham and Brentwood in Essex. In an attempt to slow the spread, the Prime Minister announced temporary and precautionary measures to be reviewed in three weeks. The UK Health Security Agency confirmed the cases, which are both believed to be connected and linked to travel to southern Africa, after genomic sequencing overnight.  The iniduals and their households were ordered into self-isolation and targeted testing was being carried out in areas where they are thought to have been infectious Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola will face travel restrictions from Sunday, when they will join South Africa and five other neighbouring nations on Englandaposs red list. Mr Johnson said: We need to take targeted and proportionate measures now as a precaution while we find out more. First we need to slow down the seeding of the iant in this country, we need to buy time for our scientists to understand exactly what weaposre dealing with, and for us to get more people vaccinated, and above all to get more people boosted. But the Prime Minister said border measures can only ever minimise and delay the arrival of a new iant rather than stop it all together, so all contacts with a suspected case of the new iant will have to isolate for  days, regardless of their vaccination status. We will also go further in asking all of you to help contain the spread of this iant by tightening up the rules on face coverings in shops and on public transport, Mr Johnson said. While the effectiveness of vaccines against Omicron is currently unclear, Mr Johnson said there are good reasons for believing they will provide at least some measure of protection.

The TV environmentalist sent a moving letter to sick William Verden, , who is in a right-to-le struggle between doctors and his parents.Chris urged William’s mum Amy to “be strong and fight long and hard.” She said the family were “totally blown away” by his backing.Medics think William should no longer have le-saving treatment as his kidneys are “devastated” and a transplant is unlikely to work. His parents oppose condemning him to end-of-le care and are ready to fight Manchester Children’s Hospital decision.  Autistic William is kept alive by gruelling daily dialysis sessions and now has toy tiger Richard. Amy, , said: “The tiger, his adopted brother, is also in end-stage renal failure. When William needs dressing changes, so does Richard.” Amy, of Newton, Lancs, thinks palliative care is not the only option, as William, who has focal ­segmental glomerulosclerosis, is well enough to play golf twice a week. She believes his ­autism is behind the decision, however Manchester University NHS Trust strongly denies this claim. Relatives are raising funds to buy William an iPad and treats.

And like you there are some things that I find really hard to deal with. I have to try really hard to make them acceptable, I think about them in advance and imagine all the things that might happen. I run through all the things that might happen over and over again.  Then when it actually comes to dealing with those things I find I am much better prepared, its almost like they have actually already happened, so it doesn’t matter as much when they do. Maybe you could try this with your medical treatments, get yourself prepared in advance. William, everyone is trying to help you. They really, really love you and want you to be well. When you are calm and everything is cool try to think about this and make plans to help them help you. And then try to stick to those plans – even when everything gets hectic. It’s very hard, but I really hope you can try. Imagine everything like that is a hole in one! Now that would be something.

But whether catching it would lead to more severe illness will not be known for weeks. But the doctor who discovered the Omicron iant said the UK was panicking unnecessarily and that the symptoms are extremely mild. Dr Angelique Coetzee, chair of the South African Medical Association, told The Andrew Marr Show she first encountered the iant in a man in his early s who presented with tiredness and a mild headache, but none of the usual coronavirus symptoms. She said: What we are seeing clinically in south Africa, and remember Iaposm at the epicentre - thataposs where Iaposm practising - itaposs extremely mild. For us, thataposs mild cases. When askedthe UK was panicking unnecessarily, she said: I think you already have it there in your country and youaposre not knowing it, and I would say, yes, at this stage I would say definitely. Two weeks from now maybe we will say something dferent.What is the Government doing to stop the spread Ato mask-wearing in shops and on public transport.

Nichola Petermann was just  when she learned she had Hodgkin lymphoma and needed immediate treatment - forcing her to leave her dream job months after she started.Medics believed her symptoms, which included fevers, abdominal pain and night sweats, were a result of her contracting coronavirus in January.But as her illness got progressively worse she found herself taking painkillers six times a day in order to continue her day-to-day le. In the absence of answers Nichola, from Glasgow, repeatedly sought medical attention, but the likelihood of it being long Covid masked the advanced stage her cancer had reached. It was only after a visit to her grandmaaposs home that Nichola realised just how ill she actually was - because she needed more sleep and ate even less than her elderly relative. Charity bosses say they fear Nicholaaposs cancer experience could be replicated across the UK, as signs of cancer can be very similar to the long-term effects of coronavirus. When she was finally diagnosed with stage b cancer, her condition was so advanced that she was advised to start chemotherapy the following day - forcing her to leave her dream job working in TV which sheaposd started in December. Nichola told The Mirror: I did think it was long Covid for a long time, I had no idea how serious it was. Because I was working and it was harder to see GPs, it was really hard. I treated it myself with pain relief, but eventually it got to the point where I couldnapost handle it anymore. I was taking paracetamol six times a day, I donapost think they believed me when I said how much pain I was in. It was only when she visited her grandmother, who is herself battling stomach cancer, that she realised how ill she was. I noticed that I was sleeping more and eating less than she was, she said. That’s when I knew for certain that something was wrong. When the pain in Nicholaaposs abdomen and lower back became too much to bear, she contacted NHS , which referred her to an Immediate Assessment Unit because staff were worried about the amount of paracetamol she was taking.However, when ultrasounds and X-rays did not reveal a gynaecological problem Nichola was on the verge of being discharged before a final set of tests finally revealed how ill she was. I was told I was possibly going home, even though I was clearly in a lot of pain, she said. I was scared about having to leave. It was only after an ultrasound revealed oian cysts and trapped fluid that medics were finally able to give her a le-saving cancer diagnosis. By that stage her lymph nodes were swollen - another symptom she put down to long Covid - and doctors had to break the news that Nichola had Hodgkin lymphoma. I hadnapost heard of it, I didnapost know what it meant, she said. Itaposs a very aggressive cancer, but that does mean it can be easier to treat. As soon as it was diagnosed they realised how serious it was, I started chemotherapy the next day. Such was the urgency to start chemotherapy that Nichola was advised there was not time to undergo fertility preservation. She spent  weeks in hospital, with the treatment leaving her unable to walk and having to be fed through a tube due to muscositis. Nichola lost three stone during her time at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, and had to be helped by nurses to move around. She praised the dedicated medics who supported her during her treatment. Although they were also clearly short staffed, I never felt like it impacted my care at all, she said. Nichola was finally discharged in August, and a month later she was given the welcome news that her cancer is in remission. Still suffering from chronic fatigue and struggling to walk long distances, Nichole is hoping to be able toto work in the New Year. Iaposm much better but Iaposm still being quite slow, Iaposm still struggling a lot with a lot of pain. Iaposm getting there, I still have a lot of fatigue, but Iaposm really eager to get back to work, I will hopefully start looking for something after Christmas. In the meantime Nichola is determined to do something to support Blood Cancer UK, a charity who she said has been a huge help during her illness.Over the course of November she has been walking every day in a . mile challenge, and her fundraising page has already raised more than £,.Kate Keightley, head of support and service development, said: “During the peak of the pandemic, we saw far fewer people being diagnosed with blood cancer, and one of the reasons for this could be that some of the symptoms of blood cancer are easily mistaken for Covid. Symptoms such as fatigue, fever and night sweats can sometimes be dismissed or downplayed and the result can be devastating. “More than half of British adults cannot name any symptom of blood cancer despite it being the third biggest cancer killer in the UK. If you have symptoms that cannot be explained and are persistent, you should urgently make an appointment with your GP. While it is unlikely to be anything serious, it’s so important to get checked out.”To sponsor Nichola and support Blood Cancer UK, click here.Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON NHSHospitalsCancerHodgkins lymphoma\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Hotel cleaner Leslie Southam lives with his elderly parents in a red-brick home kept with pride in the middle of Brynmefys, an estate a couple of miles from Llanelli town centre. The family have lived there since the mid s when it was a bustling community but the remaining homes couldnapost be further from Leslieaposs childhood memories.The attached property is being swallowed by a tree, its door boarded up and its windowsills decaying, reports WalesOnline. He believes that we are in the last days before Jesus Christapossto Earth and the apocalypse. The way things are going, itaposs only going to be seven years at most, he told WalesOnline.  It is one of  properties in a similar — or worse — condition on the estate, which began emptying in the s as the council floated plans to develop the area. Carcasses of homes are rotting, roofs collapsing, nature taking back the land and windows smashed. The streets are fenced off in places and have piles of rubbish dumped where, while the sign for the abandoned community hall rusts and fades.  Leslie, , was born in Cardigan and moved to Brynmefys with his English parents aged seven. Their home is now one of only three on the estate still occupied. A couple of cars parked on the road are a reminder of le. Leslie said: To be honest itaposs quite nice here. Itaposs quiet. My mumaposs  and my dadaposs . They like it here. I am past caring. I donapost think anything will ever be done. Carmarthenshire council have been doing the same thing over and over for years. They seem to get money for this and that, then it disappears. Weaposve had lots of dferent schemes but nothing has ever been done. And itaposs ended up like this.  He says he doesnapost really miss the Brynmefys of his childhood, an estate absolutely full with cars and people and children. While remembering the estate of yesteryear and explaining the current situation Leslie says there is another reason he has given up on development plans – he believes the world will end in seven years. When he explains why his dad bought their home under Right to Buy in  he says: He was buying it for the plot rather than the house. It was either rent for the rest of your le or buy this. He got it for almost nothing. You wouldnapost even buy a car for it.  After the scheme to redevelop the estate fell through in the late s many homes were derelict and unfit for renting. Thanks to a grant in the s Leslieaposs family were able to make key renovations to theirs but many other occupied houses were also falling into disrepair. His and the two other households on the estate live in privately owned homes but the land Brtnmefys is built on is council-owned.  The estate is in Carmarthenshire, the county with the most empty homes in Walesbut also the fastest rising house prices, which surged by  per cent to £, in the year to March. But the council has repeatedly failed to sell the estate and plans for developments have fallen through. Now a protected species of bats occupy many of the homes making demolition a tough task. A full report on the scale of the problem is due in January.  The sewage network is also not up to scratch and fixing it would require buying out the current owners. But the councilaposs offers have been rejected despite the fact Leslie says his parents would consider selling for the right price. Media coverage of the estate has led to an influx of teenagers who turn up in cars thinking the area may be haunted. Fences with aposdanger - keep outapos warnings pinned to them have been erected as a result. Leslie said: For some reason kids in their late teens were always turning up thinking there were ghosts here. They would come in their cars on weekends and try to get into the houses. Now a security guard waits here at night every weekend.

Poppy and Lola need to wear knitted woolly jumpers most of the year - and even sun cream during the summer. The Staffy sisters are both real ‘head turners’, according to Bournemouth based Staffie and Stray Rescue, who are currently looking after the girls. Their lack of fur is a result of a genetic skin condition, and means they need regular medicated baths and extra TLC. But the white pied Staffies still love nothing more than a good tummy rub. Staffie and Stray Rescue welfare operations manager, Sophie Vye, said: “We see all sorts of reasons why dogs come into rescue but circumstances like this are really sad because it’s no-oneaposs fault. “The family did what they could to help, but with other pets in the family, the only way was to surrender them to rescue. “They’re really lovely natured dogs and are bonded, so they will be needing a home together.  “Poppy and Lola have settled quickly in their foster home, and love sleeping on the bed and cuddling on the sofa like typical Staffies.”When Poppy and Lola were first introduced to the Staffie and Stray Rescue Facebook followers, their post was seen by over two million people - yet two weeks later, they’d received zero applications.But there has been more interest in the hairless hounds in recent weeks, as well as floods of people offering to knit them woolly jumpers. The TeamDogs Christmas Gt Guide, sponsored by Keep Wales Tidy, is packed with more than  treats, toys, gadgets and garments to make every dog’s tail wag with holly jolly joy on December . Weaposve tried and tested many of the gts on our own TeamDogs friends so you can ensure they’re worth placing under the tree for your most special member of the family. To download our Christmas Gt Guide for free simply subscribe to the TeamDogs newsletter. Sophie added: “As the temperatures continue to drop as we push into winter season, we are looking for knitting experts who could knit a jumper for our girls. As they are hairless, they will need to be kept as warm as possible - and we’d love a red jumper for Poppy, and pink for Lola, to help us tell them apart! “We’ve had a few people offer to make some jumpers for them, and it’s likely they’ll have a whole wardrobe soon.” The seven-year-old dogs are currently in a foster home, and are looking to live in an adult-only home with no other dogs, cats or children.Sophie added: “Lola loves cuddles and giving lots of kisses. She is a very loving girl but can be nervous around children and other animals. She gets anxious outside of the home environment and will be looking for a home who can help build her confidence and give her further training.“Poppy loves having her belly tickled and she loves to curl up on your lap to sleep - she also likes to snore loudly when she sleeps. “She prefers shorter walks but walks really well on the lead.” Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON TeamDogsAnimalsDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jason, , who survived a suicide bomber in , told us: “Anyone medically discharged with a mental health disorder will have to fight for compensation and help. “There is a major dference in the way the Ministry of Defence treats a mental health injury compared with a physical injury. “It took me six years before I was diagnosed with PTSD.

Little Eris unexpectedly entered the world at  weeks and five days, weighing the same as a small can of soup at lb oz. She was placed straight into a plastic bag to keep her vital organs warm - preventing the risk of hypothermia - whilst mum Cayce Lee, , was under general anaesthetic following the emergency c-section. Cayce,  and her husband Dennis, , prepared to say goodbye on more than one occasion during the  days in the neonatal intensive care unit . Cayce, from Lewisville, North Carolina US, said: “I was always quite nervous when I was pregnant with Eris as I had a stillbirth before. “The doctors stitched my cervix shut to prevent an early breach, and I was having progesterone injections from about  weeks.  “At  weeks, the doctor’s found that I was already dilated by two centimetres. “I managed to last another three weeks, which helped us to get Eris over the threshold where medical staff could intervene to save her le. After going into labour, Cayce was put under anaesthetic as a surgical team performed an emergency c-section, placing Eris into a sandwich bag before racing to place her in the NICU on a ventilator.After her birth, Eris developed a series of health problems, including a staph infection caused by bacteria, pneumonia, and sepsis.At one point, Eris was also put on a le support machineafter being coming extremely ill, and unable to breathe alone.  Her parents were told to say goodbye on more than one occasion. Cayce said: “Eris had pneumonia four times, and we’d be getting calls at : am to come to see her as the hospital was so concerned about her condition. “There were so many times when we didn’t think she’d make it. “But she pulled through every single time. She added: “Her lungs were the main problem, as she really struggled to breathe alone. “She was pretty much on all the maxed-out settings on the ventilator. Cayce first got to hold Eris at one and a half weeks, whilst husband Dennis was only able to hold her after seven weeks due to Erisapos fragile state, alongside Covid- restrictions. It was several weeks before Cayce was able to hold Eris once more. The Mirror is committed to more hopeful news.

The move, reported by the Sunday , may be seen as something of an olive branch after the airing of the show, which alleges staff from Prince Harry and Prince Williamaposs households briefed against each other, ruffled royal feathers. Harry said: Maybe people know this and maybe they don’t, but the term Megxit was or is a misogynistic term, and it was created by a troll, amplied by royal correspondents, and it grew and grew and grew into mainstream media. But it began with a troll.  The episode tomorrow will examine the “circumstances around the decision of the Sussexes to step down from their senior royal roles”. It is expected to air claims of a lack of support for Harry and we Meghan and of a senior household member helping a tabloid in its court case against her. Harry and Meghan moved to Calornia in the spring of  to lead a more independent le, quitting royal duties to live as private citizens. They have since signed a lucrative commercial deal with Spoty and Meghan has written a childrenaposs book which got mixed reviews.  Harry has said that part of the reason for their departure was the racist treatment of Meghan, whose mother is black and whose estranged father is white. They have since given an extensive interview with Oprah Winfrey explaining their decision. They currently live in LA with son Archie and daughter Lilibet.The Palace has dismissed the documentary as overblown and unfounded with fears it has seriously damaged the relationship between the BBC and the royal family. Jenny Afia, the Duchess of Sussex’s lawyer, will appear again in the second episode, which covers  to  as will other royal commentators and those close to the couple. A rare joint statement by Buckingham Palace, Clarence House and Kensington Palace said: “A free, responsible and open press is of vital importance to a healthy democracy. However, too often it is overblown and unfounded claims from unnamed sources that are presented as facts and it is disappointing when anyone, including the BBC, gives them credibility.

The -year-old, originally from the Kurdish region of Iran, was fished from the freezing water before succumbing to the waves and the cold. Mr Shekha desperately clung to a lejacket to survive until a rescue vessel reached him. And, speaking to his brother from Calais, he has vowed to try the deadly crossing again. He had been travelling to the UK to find a job to pay for his younger sisteraposs medical bills, which doctors told them would cost thousands of pounds. His brother Marwan, , told The Sunday Times : Itaposs a miracle. He canapost swim at all. I donapost know how it happened.He added: All of a sudden, he found himself in the water too. He said he canapost stop thinking about the other people who died in front of him. It keeps coming back in his mind. He didnapost know how to rescue the women who fell in. The Sunday Times reports that Mohammed and his brother worked, saved and mortgaged a plot of family land so they could take out a , loan before contacting a smuggler.  Mohammed was then flown from Syria to Belarus from where he could enter the EU. Once he reached northern France, and with Marwan helping him, he made contact with an Iraqi-Kurdish smuggler in Turkey, who charged him , on top of the , for his bid to get to the UK. As Marwan worried about his elder brother on Wednesday evening, he received a video call. It was Mohammed on a paramedicaposs phone, barely able to speak. By Friday he was recovered and back in the Calais camp. He spoke to Marwan again, reports the Times, saying: I’m doing this for my family. If I come back, I can’t make a living. I’m going to try again.  Other details have emerged regarding the  people who died in one of the worst ever disasters in the Channel. A relative identied -year-old Maryam Nuri Mohamed Amin, known to her family as Baran, as one of those who died on what was the deadliest day of the migration crisis. The student was said to have been trying to join her fiance, who already lives in Britain, as her cousin urged the British and French governments to help people resettle rather than force them to take this route of death. Krmanj Ezzat Dargali told Sky News: The situation is just awful. She was a woman in the prime of her le. I understand why so many people are leaving for a better le, but this is not the correct path. Itaposs the route of death.  Also among those who died was Harem Pirot, , and his friend Twana Mamand Muhammad, both from Rayna in Iraq, according to The Observer. Mr Pirot had been trying to reach England to meet his brother Anwar, a Sheffield graduate living in Cambridge. The Observer also said there was a family from the Iraqi Kurdish town of Darbandikhan - Khazal Hussein, , and her children Haida, , son Mubin, , and younger daughter Hasti, seven. Ms Husseinaposs husband, Rezgar, said: My we and children were unhappy with our le here. They wanted us all to go to the UK. I told them I couldnapost come because of my job as a policeman. I would lose it. They insisted to go so I agreed I would join themthey made it, andthey didnapost, they could come back. I never knew it was risky.

As a working mum of two, I really feel for her. Early years are hard, juggling work, childcare and le with not much sympathy or empathy. But there are two threads to her story. First, a mother’s right to take their baby into their working environment – in Ms Creasy’s case cocooned to her chest in a sling while a debate was going on. Unfortunately that right had been taken away by a parliamentary rule banning infants from the chamber – now to be reviewed. For me, taking my babies to work at three months old would have been the last thing on my mind – in smart clothes, breastfeeding and all the bits and bobs such as wipes, bibs, nappies etc. I like to keep work and my personal le separate – for my own sanity and the baby’s too.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter I breastfed for eight months, in shopping centres, parks and cafés. But I’d never have done it in front of colleagues in a meeting. Not because of embarrassment, but out of consideration for those without kids and who may feel uncomfortable seeing my breast out and a baby suckling while discussing a profit statement. Also, the Commons is no place for a baby’s natural development. Mine during this early stage were keen to learn through touching, hearing, smelling and looking – they’d make gurgling sounds, let out screams of excitement and yelps of joy – this is what they should be encouraged to do. SoI were in a meeting with my child strapped to my bosom, I would be distracted and feel guilty for not giving both my child and colleagues my full attention. Also, is Ms Creasy trying to set a precedent for all women to have the right to take their baby into their work environment  So will a TV presenter have the right to read the news while breastfeeding  Can a police officer have her baby with her on patrol  Can a teacher take hers into the classroom  Where do we draw the line  On a parenting course, a key message for me was that it’s important to put the needs of the child before your own. The second thread to Ms Creasy’s story is the need to make holding down a job easier for mums – so more creches at work, help with childcare and more nursery places.  As an MP, Ms Creasy already has it all – maternity leave on full pay, use of the family room in Westminster, an on site nursery, £, for a locum to cover constituency work for six months, and a baby leave proxy vote while away. Being allowed to vote remotely in those early years, between  and , instead of trudging into Westminster for late-night isions would be good sense. I think these are the points Ms Creasy should be making. Waving your flag for having babies in the Commons just makes a mockery of more fundamental challenges for working mums everywhere.

Britain is set to offer a team of up to  elite troops from the Special Reconnaissance Regimentto help French police tackle the crisis. The undercover soldiers may even disguise themselves as migrants in an attempt to infiltrate traffickers. It comes as harrowing stories continued to emerge of the  migrants, mostly from a camp near Dunkirk, who perished when their boat deflated in the Channel on Wednesday. They include Kurdish bride-to-be Maryam Hamdamin, , who was trying to get into the UK to join her fiance in Bournemouth.Migrants in squalid makesht camp told the Sunday People how smugglers were still offering deadly trips across the Channel despite the latest deaths.Security chiefs have told Downing Street that the only way to control the vast numbers of people embarking on the voyage is to target traffickers.British diplomats hope the offer of special forces will improve tensions between London and Paris after President Macron cancelled a meeting with Boris Johnson over the crisis. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter One source said: “Last week’s tragedy was a tipping point which was always going to come. “The UK has a lot of assets which could be used to help the French clamp down on the traffickers. It is accepted that trying to stop migrants coming across the Channel doesn’t work. The key to the problem is the traffickers. If they can’t , the migrants can’t cross. “Whether or not France will accept the offer remains to be seen. These things are always diplomatically fraught and no country likes to admit that it needs help.” Operators from the regiment could be used to track and film traffickers and hand over the intelligence to the French authorities. It is also understood that Britain’s eavesdropping centre GCHQ will offer to hack into the criminal gangs’ mobile phone networks.  British and French special forces have a close relationship and are working together against Islamic terrorists in Mali, West Africa. The SRR is the most secret part of UK special forces and is the only elite unit to recruit women. It specialises in aggressive surveillance and is often deployed on operations regarded as too dangerous for MI. It supports the police and MI on counter-terrorist operations in the UK and often works with MI officers on foreign missions. The regiment has fought in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria and troops often disguise themselves in local clothing such as Arabic robes. Similar measures could be used to identy people smugglers, it is claimed. At least  men, seven women – including bride-to-be Maryam and another who was pregnant – and three children are known to have died in Wednesday’s doomed trip.  Mohammad Aziz, , is another feared drowned after he phoned a friend to say: “It’s not good, the engine isn’t powerful enough – I don’t knowwe’re going to make it.” He has not been heard of since his frantic call to a fellow Iraqi Kurd. Fears were also growing for a group of Afghan youngsters who are missing. Riaz Mohammed, , his relative Share Mohammed, , and two other teenagers, Palowan, , and Shinai, , were attempting the crossing that day. One charity worker at the camp said it was dficult to know who had died as UK authorities confiscate mobile phones of those who do get across. A migrant who has tried and failed to cross the Channel four times told how Calais is so dangerous he carries a gun.  Mohammed Hutamzadth lives in sheltered accommodation after travelling to France five years ago from Iran, where he was a car park manager. The -year-old previously boarded trucks at the ferry port and Eurotunnel in his attempts to cross into the UK. Each time he was caught by French police and sent to detention centres where he would spend about seven hours before being freed. Mohammed said: “It is too easy to find a smuggler here, you just ask around. Living here is very dangerous, there is a sort of mafia who control everything. Everything is le and death. I have to have a gun for protection. “I have no passport, the only ID I have is this paperwork and some of what it says is not even correct. “Here in Calais, money is god. As long as I have money I will easily find someone who will take me in a boat.  “Or maybe I will try and buy a boat myself. Everyone heard about the people that drowned of course, and it is sad. It is a risk that I still wish to take. “I will take a boat next month. Of course it is dangerous. But my whole le has become dangerous.” Remnants of rubber dinghies littered the sand dunes on the coast at Wimereux near Calais yesterday. We found a cardboard box marked Scuba Schools International containing two water pumps and a makesht water scoop.

A yellow warning for snow and ice remains in place until mid-morning on Sunday in Scotland and the north of England.The Met Office has warned of a risk of wintry showers and icy stretches.Temperatures were expected to struggle to get above freezing in some parts, with -C forecast in Manchester and Newcastle. The Met Office said it would be a cold and frosty start to the day, with showers affecting eastern coastal areas.  It added that there is a risk of icy stretches, with snow showers becoming more extensive over parts of Scotland and the north-west of England early on Sunday. The cold spell comes after three people were killed when trees were blown over in strong winds as Storm Arwen hit on Friday. Gusts of almost mph also saw transport disrupted, power cuts and damage to buildings, while heavy snow saw lorries get stuck and ploughs being used in a number of areas.  Summing up the damage caused by the first named storm of the season, the Met Office said the strong winds and a mixture of rain, sleet and snow led to power cuts, transport disruption, trees fell, there were large coastal waves and blizzards affected some hills. Marco Petagna, a Met Office forecaster, told the PA news agency: Weaposve seen some pretty severe gusts overnight with the highest speeds hitting mph at Brizlee Wood in Northumberland.  Elsewhere, exposed sites in Scotland and Northern Ireland also surpassed mph, with -mph seen more widely in the north of the UK, though parts of southern England and Wales also felt the effects of the storm. This has been coupled with a few inches of snow which has fallen in some areas. In the higher ground areas of Scotland we expected to see up to cm falling but the strong winds meant the snow blew around and created a blizzard in some parts.  Police Scotland said a -year-old man died when his pick-up truck was struck by a falling tree on the B Dyce to Hatton of Fintray Road in Aberdeenshire at about .pm on Friday. Cumbria Police said a man from Lancaster died in Ambleside after a tree fell on him just before pm. In Northern Ireland, a man was killed when his car was hit by a falling tree in County Antrim. Wind speeds reached mph in Orlock Head, Co Down. Inverbervie on the north-east coast of Scotland had gusts of mph, while Aberporth in Wales saw speeds of mph.  People were advised to be wary of travelling, as train networks across the UK reported disruption to services. All Avanti West Coast services North of Carlisle were cancelled on Saturday, with customers strongly advised not to attempt to travel on the route. ScotRail services were disrupted between Edinburgh and Glasgow Queen Street, Dunblane and Stirling after a barn was blown on to the line close to Polmont, near Falkirk.Passengers travelling on an Aberdeen-bound train on Friday had to wait  hours at Huntly railway station in Aberdeenshire due to the extreme weather. TransPennine Express customers were urged not to travel, with services between Newcastle and Edinburgh cancelled. South Western Railway services were disrupted on Saturday due to multiple trees and obstructions blocking the railway, while London North East Railway warned customers not to travel north of York due to signicant damage.

He stated his brother Thomas Hughes, who is jointly accused of murder, went aposwithin himselfapos when he started a relationship with Tustin and started to lose ties with his family.Tustin, , and Hughes, , have denied murder and multiple counts of child cruelty. It is alleged they apossystematicallyapos abused Arthur during the first coronavirus lockdown before he collapsed of fatal head injuries at their home in Cranmore Road, Shirley on June  last year.He died the following morning in hospital after doctors concluded he could not be saved and switched his le support off.The trial at Coventry Crown Court resumed yesterday after a number of issues ground proceedings to a halt for more than three days this week.On Monday, the jury was told that Tustin had been taken to hospital due to concerns over her health. This afternoon Judge Wall stated she had been assessed and deemed fit to continue. He also confirmed one juror has now been discharged on health grounds and reiterated a previous direction to the remainder of the  to ignore media coverage of the case. As the only witness to give evidence yesterday, Andrew Hughes described his first impression of Tustin as aposvery, very coldapos. He stated his brotheraposs relationship with her moved aposvery quicklyapos and that Thomas Hughes soon became aposstricterapos on Arthur by punishing him for minor things that aposwerenapost an issue beforeapos. Mr Hughes added his brother found it aposincreasingly hardapos to spend time with Arthur because Tustin would aposmake an effort to interveneapos.  He told the court the last time he saw Arthur was around a week before the first lockdown in March  and said: He seemed far more timid. He seemed more aware he may get in trouble. There was this voice Arthur would sometimes make, referred to as his baby voice. Before it was never an issue but it became an issue not long after Ms Tustin came on the scene. Mr Hughes stated his brother was aposvery warmapos with a aposstrong belief in familyapos prior to meeting Tustin. Describing his impression of his brother afterwards he added: He went within himself. With his immediate family, mom, dad, brothers, the ties seemed to become weaker and weaker. He didnapost seem to be invested in keeping that strong. In cross-examination Mr Hughes was askedthought everything that happened to Arthur was Tustinaposs fault, to which he replied: I believe sheaposs the catalyst for it. He denied he had intentionally walked in front of her in just his shorts to aposshow offapos, although acknowledged his brother told him off for doing so.  He stated he found nothing attractive about Tustin and said: She was domineering. If she didnapost get what she wanted she would make things dficult for everyone . Reiterating his view of her Mr Hughes added: A cold, manipulating, calculating person who made every attempt to stay away from the family and draw my brother from the family as well. It has previously been alleged Tustin and Thomas Hughes made Arthur spend up to  hours a day isolated in their hallway, assaulted him, deprived him of food and water as well as poisoned him with salt. The prosecution has argued Hughes encouraged violence towards his son but that Tustin carried out the fatal attack while she was alone with him at the Cranmore Road address. The trial began in early October and today Judge Wall told the jury they could be sent out to reach verdicts as early as next Wednesday.

Colleen Smith had only recently moved in with Samantha Hart and Charlie Olding, who she considered to be friends, when the couple dragged her into their cellar where they filmed themselves raping her. Some of the stomach-churning attack was filmed by Oldingaposs cousin Lee Kitchiner, who was  at the time. The couple have since been jailed and Colleen, , has bravely decided to waive her anonymity to encourage other victims to seek help.Speaking to the Daily Star, she said she has been “scarred for le” and has nightmares in which she wakes up screaming.“What they did was make me feel not wanted, ashamed and lonely,” she said. “I sometimes get voices in my head telling me I’m worthless. I was a happy and lively person but now I’m down and depressed.“I am just a broken person now.” Colleen, from Medway, Kent, moved in with the couple in October  and found the pair “constantly argued” creating a tense atmosphere in the house. Three weeks after moving, on September , Colleen headed out with a friend to the pub, where they enjoyed some drinks. But at some point during the night, Olding and Hart began to call her. Colleen recalled: “I even said to my friend it was weird because they never ring me that much. My mate told me not to go back and she had an instinct that something was going to happen. I told her not to be silly and that nothing will happen. “I thought they were my friends.” Colleen’s pal gave her a lt to the home in Chatham, Kent, and the vile abuse started shortly after. Hart, Olding and Kitchiner were waiting for her in the alleyway beside the property, where they “smacked” Colleen in the face before throwing her phone onto train tracks. She was then dragged into the home and ordered to go down to the cellar. Colleen said: “I have never been a fighter and I don’t like arguments so I was more shocked than anything. I was totally shocked like ‘why would you do this ’ and it was just very confusing. “I hoped it was a dream and I was going to wake up any minute, but obviously it wasn’t a dream.” Colleen said she was eventually forced to perform a sex act on Olding, while being filmed. Next, Olding proceeded to rape her as the others watched.  She said: “I was trying my hardest to tell them to stop but they wouldn’t stop. “I could see they were filming and I was thinking in my head are they going to send this to my friends  Are they going to send this to people so they can laugh at me and that’s what I was worried about. I didn’t knowI was going to live or not.” The brutality lasted six hours before the trio eventually went upstairs to go to bed. At this point, around .am, a badly hurt Colleen decided to try and flee, legging it to a friend’s house. “I thought apos I don’t run I will die - If I don’t run Iaposm gone and my family won’t even knowapos,” she said. Colleen reached her friend’s home and the police arrived  minutes later. She was taken to hospital with a suspected broken eye socket and the despicable trio were arrested. Colleen was eventually diagnosed with PTSD before she bravely gave evidence via video link during the trial at Maidstone Crown Court earlier this year. The court was shown more than  video clips from Olding’s phone of the brutal assault. Hart and Olding,  and , from Chatam, Kent, were convicted of rape and causing a person to engage in sexual activity - receiving  and  years respectively.  Meanwhile Kitchiner, now , from Strood, Kent, was found guilty of the sexual activity offence and was cleared of rape and assault. He was handed a two-year custodial sentence suspended for two years, along with  hours of unpaid work,  rehabilitation sessions, and a -month curfew. Judge Philip Statman said: “Each of you made callous, disgusting remarks about how this act should be performed. “It caused your victim to be violated and she felt embarrassed and disgusted by what she was being told to do. This was a grave attack of a sexual nature perpetrated on your victim.” Colleen added: “I wanted to go to the sentencing to look them in the eye to show them what they have done to me but I couldn’t. But I thought it was an amazing sentence because I feared they would be let free. “I hope they get what they deserve in prison for what they did to me.” Colleen is now taking things one day at a time and dreams of one day being her old self, able to live her le the way she wants, independently, without looking over her shoulder. “Thankfully my mum and my siblings have got me through this. If it wasn’t for them I don’t think I would be here,” she said. “I’m not going to say I’m doing really well but I’m getting there. I am starting to be me again, well trying to. It has been so hard.” Colleen wants to now speak out to encourage other survivors who may be dealing with trauma alone to get support. She said: “Don’t be scared to speak about what you have been through. Please tell someone, I’ve learned thatyou tell someone you can get the support you need. “It’s so important not to bottle it up like I did.” Read MoreRead MoreFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON HospitalsCourt caseCrown courtCrimeRape\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It comes after Belgium became the first European country to announce it had identied the strain on Friday, while health officials in the Netherlands and the Czech Republic have identied suspected Omicron cases. It has sparked a new wave of travel restrictions, with further countries likely to bring in measures to limit the spread of the iant. Experts across the world are scrambling to determine whether Omicron is more deadly and whether it evades vaccines. News of the iantaposs spread have prompted alarm among world leaders, with Israel bringing in a blanket ban on international travellers. The iant has now been detected in the UK, Germany, Italy, Belgium, South Africa, Australia, Botswana, Israel and Hong Kong.  Additionally health authorities in the Netherlands and the Czech Republic yesterday said they believed they had identied cases, and were carrying out tests to confirm this. Austria is also investigated suspected instances of the iant within its borders.Yesterday Health Secretary Sajid Javid confirmed that two cases of the mutant strain had been found in the UK - one in Brentwood, Essex, and the other in Nottingham.Last night Switzerland was among the first to respond to the UKaposs announcement by stating that people arriving from these shores would have to isolate for  days, even after testing negative. This morning officials in Australia announced two cases of the iant had been found in passengers arriving in Sydney from southern Africa.  Both were asymptomatic, fully vaccinated and in quarantine, health officials in New South Wales said. It follows in the footsteps of Germany and Italy confirming their own Omicron cases. The German state of Baia announced two confirmed cases of the iant yesterday. Meanwhile In Italy, the National Health Institute said a case of the new iant had been detected in Milan in a person coming from Mozambique. On Friday Belgian authorities said a person travelling into the country from Egypt had been found to have the new Covid strain.  It is feared that the emergence of the Omicron iant, described by scientists as the most complex mutation yet, could prolong the pandemic further. Israel said it would ban the entry of all foreigners into the country and reintroduce counter-terrorism phone-tracking technology to contain the spread of the iant. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said in a statement that the ban, pending government approval, would last  days. Interior minister Ayelet Shaked said: Our working hypotheses are that the iant is already in nearly every country, and that the vaccine is effective, although we donapost yet know to what degree.Yesterday Boris Johnson announced that people arriving in the UK from abroad would have to do a PCR test and isolate until they have confirmation of a negative result. The iant, classied as of concern by the World Health Organisation , was first detected in South Africa, but it is not known where it originated. Following its discovery countries across the world, including the UK, slapped travel restrictions on the country and a number of its neighbours. South African officials have hit back, saying they are being penalised for scientic excellence.Many countries have slapped restrictions on ious southern African countries over the past couple of days, including Brazil, Canada, the European Union, Iran, Australia, New Zealand and the US, in response to warnings over the transmissibility of the new iant.The UK put South Africa, Botswana, Lesostho, Eswatini, Zimbabwe and Namibia on its red list on Friday, and yesterday added Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola. Switzerland yesterday widened its quarantine rules to travellers arriving from Britain, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Egypt and Malawi, its health ministry said. Anyone travelling from these countries will need need to present a negative Covid- test and quarantine for  days as well, the Federal Office of Public Health said in a tweet.

The Thursday evening announcement meant that South Africa was added to the list from Friday at pm, so all flights were suspended and those arriving in the UK were forced to isolate for  days. From am on Sunday, this quarantine period will need to take place in a hotel. Countless Brits, including Jessica and Michael Dickinson were caught in the sudden announcement, and now find themselves stranded in South Africa, currently with no way home. Jessica, , described the situation as a “worst nightmare come true”. They had had their daughter Amelia-Rose, -months-old, during the pandemic, and none of their relatives from South Africa had seen her yet, so once restrictions lted, the pair booked a trip out to introduce her to her family. “Many people haven’t been home for quite some time, but we had our daughter and wanted her to meet the rest of her family. “When the borders opened we thought it was a great opportunity to come and see our family, we’d had a couple deaths in the family, so we thought it was important to make the trip out. “We moved to the UK and have been here for  years, we recently had our daughter and have had no family support raising her. Nobody’s met her, this was an opportunity for them to at least meet her, because people are getting old and you never know when it will be somebody’s last time.” After flying out last week, the family from Surrey were due totonight. The first they knew about the announcement was when Amelia woke Jessica up crying, and she checked her phone to see messages from a friend about it. However, as they were due toon Friday they thought they would be okay to fly home as usual. Then they got an email from British Airways saying their flight was cancelled. “It’s literally just a snowball effect of everything, getting home, my daughter being sick, jobs,” Jessica said. “My daughter’s also not been very well, she’s had a bad chest infection and I’ve been keen to get her back to the UK to have her looked at so this has really thrown us off. “In the morning , we went down for breakfast and we overheard some other Brits talking about how they were all trying to rush off. With so much changing so quickly, keep on top of what is happening with the Mirroraposs news updates by email. Delivered straight to your inbox, our daily coronavirus briefing will keep you informed of what is happening with Covid, lockdown, the vaccination rollout and the impact on how we live.here. “There were people rushing to get PCR tests and take flights that had like three stayovers. But we can’t do that, we have our daughter.” Jessica described how they had sat on the phone for hours trying to get through to ious airlines to no avail, and even how the British consulate was “useless”. “Both me and my husband are due to start back at work on Monday, but I don’t have my work laptop and we have to figure out childcare this side, whilst still paying for our nursery that side. “It’s been relentless.  “We nearly finalised another flight with Emirates on Tuesday evening, and were ready to pay until it was cancelled. “We understand we’ll have to do the hotel quarantine but we’re worried about doing it with our daughter and I’m ADHD. I’m worried about what it’s going to be like on the other side. I get that’s what it needs to be like to get back home. On the journey back they face a bill of thousands because of the government’s actions as they have to book new flights and then pay for hotel quarantine too. British Airways, like all airways operating to and from South Africa from the UK, learned about the governmentaposs ban the same time as everyone . Given no prior-warning, they were left scrambling to try and organise a way home for the Brits stuck abroad whilst having very little to no guidance from the government. They have set up a dedicated phone line for Brits in South Africa and now Jessica, Michael and Amelia have a flight booked in for the th to get them home.

And there’s one particular part of the UK where the night sky is better than anywhere  to look up at the stars and see the meteors, Milky Way, andyou’re lucky - the aurora borealis. The Brecon Beacons National Park, in Wales, is an internationally recognised dark sky reserve, meaning there is an exceptional quality of starry nights with limited pollution blocking them from view.Brecon Beacons Holiday Cottagesrecommend grabbing your binoculars this winter, and heading to Wales to witness the spectacular Geminid meteor shower, which can be seen from the Brecon Beacons during the month of December.The Northern Lights have been spotted from the Brecon Beacons and are most likely to be seen on a dark clear night in the autumn equinox from October to March.  Autumn is also the best time to see the Milky Way from the Brecon Beacons, which looks like a hazy band of light that stretches out across the night sky. Meanwhile, there are  dferent constellations in the sky and prominent ones to look out for include The Plough which points to Polarisand Orion’s Belt which is next to Sirius, the brightest star in the sky. An aptly named one to try and spot while you’re in Wales is Draco the Dragon - it’s a long curve of stars that swirls around Polaris in the northern part of the sky.

One sweet treat lover has kicked off with reviewing two of the biggest hitters: The Quality Street and Roses g tins.Fearless researcher Inequality Street shared a picture of their findings on Facebook after taking the time to sort the sweets in the box by shapes and colours.Their study found that in an g Quality Street tin, only four were Green Triangles, but a whopping  were Caramel Swirls.

Their post said: Kicking off the Christmas  chocolate audits are the two big hitters: The Quality Street and Roses g tins. On first viewing it definitely appears to be a case of Quality Street by name, Inequality Street by nature with a whopping disparity of  Caramel Swirlsto a measly  Green Triangles . Delve a little deeper and the picture is even more bleak for the delicious -sided featherweight: Weighing in at just .g each, their .g contribution to the tin represents an even more paltry .% of the overall g tin - Hang your heads in shame, Quality Street!  Over at Cadburys things definitely seem to be far more democratic with a top to bottom spread of  Golden Barrels and  Caramelsto  Signature Truffles . An honourable mention to the folks at Bournville for the fact that their g tin is Christmas-Tree-Busting g when you include the wrappers . Quality St could’ve given us an extra  Green Trianglesthey had been a bit more generous with their accounts. Other researchers were keen to offer their expert assessments of the fragile situation. One commented: I assume this research was done with a single tin of each product. We need a bigger sample to understand the natural iations.  The Roses tin sampled appears to be even numbers allowing for a iation in the tin filling. I agree Quality Street appears to be uneven. More data please. Another added: I am always taken aback at how many of those circular gold toffees there are. I put them straight in the bin as the ratio of toffee cost to filing replacement cost is off the scale. A third wrote: Suspicions Confirmed! Never enough of The Purple One! A great Math provocation for data too! Responding to the pages findings, a Nestlé spokeswoman said: “We balance our Quality Street selection by grouping the sweets into three categories that we know our consumers love: fruits toffees and fudge and nuts, chocolates and caramels, with each roughly making up a third of the total. We don’t give exact numbers for each sweet as the contents may y. We know that Quality Street fans feel very passionately about their own particular favourites, so we ensure there is something for everyone within the mix.” And for those concerned about the lack of Purple Ones or Green Triangles, rest easy, you can make your own tin. The spokeswoman added: “We know that Quality Street fans feel passionately about their favourites and there is something for everyone within the mix.If you’d like a tin that’s packed with nothing but Purple Ones, oryou can’t resist a Green Triangle, you can create your perfect mix by visiting our website – www.qualitystreet. ”Read MoreRead MoreComment MORE ON Chocolate\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Not content with the drab surroundings, Emma Parkes, , has turned her bland cottage into a multicoloured paradise - and she managed it on a small budget, Emma, , from Shropshire, who works in special needs education, moved in  months ago with her daughter Poppy, , and her son Ralph, eight. Keen to make the place feel more homely, she stripped out the old carpets to reveal rustic floorboards, which she then painted white, with permission from the landlord.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Picking a “feminine and uplting” colour palette to replace the magnolia, the mum-of-two added pops of colour into every room - spending a total of £, on the renovation. “When I first arrived, the cottage was all magnolia, but structurally sound,” Emma said. I knew I wanted to inject colour with a boho style enjoying plenty of plants throughout the house.” The first room Emma tackled was the lounge, where she spent £ overhauling the furniture with “retro” secondhand buys and creating a feature wallpapered wall. She said: “I first decorated the lounge with a colour palette of green, pink, soft pink and vivid pink. “The walk-in fireplace also had exposed brick which I freshened up with some white paint and I created a feature wall with wallpaper gted by Lust home.  “I removed the curtains and replaced them with a natural branch with plants hanging from it, I’ve also created this in my bedroom. “The windows are very pretty to look at plus the view is incredible, so I didn’t want to hide either of these with curtains.” In the kitchen, Emma spent just £ and uses her creative skills to paint a bright pink and aquamarine mural across one of the walls. The mum said: “The kitchen was the first room where I painted one of my murals on the wall. All my murals are hand-painted and original. It is very much floral-themed and uses bright but soothing colours. “The use of plants continues into the kitchen where I’ve hung a reclaimed ladder from the ceiling with flowers hanging from it.” Emma, who has done all of the work herself, began DIYing her home as a way to deal with the grief of suddenly losing her dad in .Documenting her home’s transformation on her Instagram account@tallulahcottage, which now has , followers, Emma has shared her hard work with her followers. She said: “In my bedroom, I’ve removed the carpet and exposed the floorboards and painted them white. “I have a reclaimed piece of wood above my bed which acts as a shelf and my main wall is painted Miami mint with a feature flower arrangement on it which gets a lot of love on Instagram. “The window is exposed with another branch hanging from the ceiling with plants and all the furniture is second hand.” The room, which cost just £ to create, also features an incredible floral themed hand-painted mural by Emma, costing a further £. Outside the quaint cottage is surrounded by fields, with a large driveway and garden, that wraps around the cottage “giving sunshine all day”. Emma said: “My outside space is very big and a wonderful canvas for some future plans. It’s taken me about a year to get to where I’ve got with my home. “I’m a single mum and work full time so it can be hard to achieve the work I do on my home quickly, I dip into it as and when I can.” The mum credits her “creative thinking” for being able to carry out the renovation on such a small budget. Emma said: “My budget has definitely always been on a shoestring so I often have to be creative in my thinking and I source practically everything second hand. “My style is definitely always evolving and I do love change, I’d describe my style as boho with a vintage twist. “I love to style flowers in with my interiors and this features a lot throughout my home, and my colour palette consists of uplting feminine colours that are definitely good for the soul.”Breakdown:Kitchen - £ second-hand furniture and paint for the muralLounge - £ second-hand furniture, paint.

The -year-old shot dead their daughter, who was his partner at the time, as she cowered in a bathroom on Valentineaposs Day in .Pistorius is now close to winning parole, and as part of the process, Reeva’s parents Barry and June have agreed to see the man who murdered their daughter. The disgraced athlete had been serving his .-year sentence at the “comfy” Atteredgeville Correctional Centre in Pretoria. However, he is now close to being freed.  Reeva’s elderly father Barry, who has been treated for a heart condition, and we June said that the long journey to meet him face-to-face was too much for them. So the prison authorities decided to bring Pistorius to the Steenkampaposs under high security and the utmost secrecy to make sure the meeting could happen. An hour before dawn on Friday he was “ghosted” out of Atterdgeville prison and driven the  miles to St Albans Correctional Centre which is near their home. The -hour journey saw Pistorius being transported in a prison van with a police car escort before he arrived at the notorious Port Elizabeth prison facility. It is one of the five most dangerous prisons in South Africa and houses  of the most dangerous killers and rapists in the criminal justice system.  There are constant riots and running battles between rival gangs inside the run-down jail and warders have been murdered trying to keep control. Pistorius was taken away from the main jail population where it is said the cells hold up to  dangerous prisoners each and to a secure single cell for safety. The convicted killer who murdered Reeva by shooting a hail of bullets through a bathroom door when she was cowering inside agreed to the meeting. It is not known exactly when the meet will take place but it is understood that Reeva’s parents will be driven to the medium-security prison next week. They were contacted by the SA Department of Correctional Services in October and askedthey would agree to meet Pistorius and said yes. A warder at St Albans told HeraldLive: ”He arrived late yesterdayand is being temporarily kept in a single cell far away from everyone ”. Attorney Tania Koen, who represents Steenkamp’s parents who live in Port Elizabeth  minutes from the prison confirmed the move. She said both Barry and June were “fully aware” that their daughter’s killer had been transferred from Gauteng Province near to them in Eastern Province.  Koen added: “There will be no further comment on this matter”. Department of Correctional Services spokesman Singabakho Nxumalo confirmed they had to work out logistical arrangements to move jails for Pistorius. Pistorius became unexpectedly became eligible for parole in July after the Supreme Court of Appeal ruled the  days he already served behind bars before being sentenced to -and-a-years had not been counted. He was initially sentenced to  years in prison in October , for culpable homicide but the State challenged it and in  it was changed to murder and . years. With time served before the increased murder sentence, Pistorius has now served half of it and through his attorney, the killer launched his bid for parole.  His repeated trials gripped South Africa and the world as he claimed he was trying to “protect” Reeva thinking an intruder was in his bathroom. He fired a hail of mm bullets through his bathroom door fatally hitting the model four times after crawling across his bedroom floor on his stumps. The former athlete still insists that he believed that she was an intruder. Pistorius was dubbed Blade Runner after being fitted with prosthetics to allow him to walk then run after both his lower legs were amputated when he was  months old due to a birth defect. He went on to become a Paralympic World Cup gold medal champ in the m and m and was the first double amputee to run in an able-bodied Olympic Games.

Smugglers had been demanding €,per person for the treacherous journey in flimsy dinghies.It is feared the price cut will encourage yet more to attempt the -mile trip, made even more dangerous by deteriorating weather.Victims of last week’s disaster who remain unidentied are likely to be buried in basic graves labelled ‘Monsieur or Madame X’, sources say. But the grim ending for so many has not deterred others continuing their desperate efforts to reach the UK.  “We know about the people who died but we have no choice,” said Iraqi-Kurd Hassan Ahmed at the sprawling Grand-Synthe camp near Dunkirk. “I was told the price has come down because of people dying, €,.” The -year-old added: “It is still expensive – but I will try and get on a boat one day, one week.” Hassan, who says he spent €, just to reach the French coast, said migrants making the crossing receive a message before they embark telling them where their dinghy has been hidden in miles of sand dunes.  A second message gives the location of an outboard motor and a pump with which to inflate the boat. He said the migrants deal with the traffickers via an Eastern European go-between known only as Akim. Hassan is among  living in squalid conditions near old rail tracks, and the hopeful keep on coming. Nine members of the Al-Kahzraji family – including children aged four,  and  – pitched tents yesterday. Mum Shadan said the family fled fighting in Iraqi Kurdistan. After spending several years in Germany she claims the authorities there refused them papers to remain. Older son Danyal, , said they had been told it will cost €, to get them all to the UK.  As his little brother and sister Havel and Nur played on the litter-strewn tracks, he said: “We want a le in Great Britain. We want to live there and work there.” He said they knew many people had died making the crossing this week. But it was a risk worth taking as they could notto Kurdistan. At least  men, seven women – including one who was pregnant – and three children are confirmed dead. But detectives from France’s Organised Crime squad believe empty le jackets suggest more drowned. Bodies that cannot be identied are likely to join dozens buried in anonymous graves in Calais. We saw three such graves at Cimetière Sud, in an area a groundsman said is “for migrants, the poor and destitute”. Each cement slab had a sign saying “Monsieur X” and the year of death. At another cemetery – Cimetière Nord – a groundsman pointed out more plots. Many are little more than mounds of mud and a cross. Some  plots are marked out for more burials. Campaigners despair over the “undignied” end and the fact it means victims’ families may never even receive confirmation of their death. Nathanaël Caillaux, of Catholic charity Secours Catholique Calais Accueil Social, said: “It’s more than a few. It is very sad.” Non-profit organisation Groupe Décès has called on French authorities to identy and find family members to arrange repatriation. The group usually tries this itself, but Mr Caillaux said “ people is impossible and this should be the work of the state”.  Police have interviewed the only two survivors of Wednesday’s tragedy after they were released from hospital. The men – an Iraqi Kurd identied as Mohammed Khalid and a Somalian named as Omar, who are in their s – told of “mass panic” as the boat deflated and sank into the sea. An investigating source said authorities fear there may be more dead as empty lejackets were found in the sea. “People smugglers don’t provide extra lejackets, so the assumption is there will still be bodies,” he said. Soaking bank notes found in some of victims’ clothes helped confirm the dead include a Kurdish woman and man from Syria, two Yemeni men, an Iranian Kurd and two Iraqis. Kurd Maryam Nuri Hamdamin, , who messaged her fiancé in the UK after the boat got into trouble, was the first victim officially named. And Mohammad Aziz, , is feared drowned after he phoned a pal to say: “The engine isn’t powerful enough – I don’t knowwe’re going to make it.”  Fears are also growing for four Afghan youngsters. Riaz Mohammed, , Share Mohammed, , and two other teens, Palowan, , and Shinai, , were among those trying to cross. One charity worker said it was hard to know who had died and who had “made it” from any crossing as UK authorities confiscate the mobile phones of anybody they find. But more are waiting to make the journey under the ruthless smugglers, because le is so miserable here and in the places they came from. Mohammed Hutamzadth, , who has made four failed bids to reach the UK, lives in sheltered accommodation after travelling from Iran five years ago. He keeps a gun for protection. He said: “Living is very dangerous, there is a sort of mafia who control everything. In Calais, money is God. “As long as I have money I will easily find someone who will take me in a boat. Of course it is dangerous. But my whole le has become dangerous.” To underline his point, evidence of crossings littered the beach at Wimereux, near Boulogne, yesterday. A water scoop cut out of a petrol can and bits of what looked like jacket straps were among the detritus. Charity volunteer Phoebe Westwood, , from Bristol says the only way to end the chaos – and deaths – is to provide a “safe or legal route” and process applications properly. “The week before the shipwreck  people were rescued from the sea,” she said. “It’s tragedy after tragedy.” aposNo must end blame game and solve crisisapos - Comment, by Nick Thomas-Symonds, Shadow Home Secretary I am furious with the vile people-smuggling gangs putting lives in deadly danger to make money. This has to stop. It should not take the tragic deaths of  people, including children and a pregnant mother, to kick-start action. For years the Conservatives vowed to solve this. But on their watch the number of people crossing has soared from  in  to more than , this year. And even now they are trying to blame others for their failings. The PM humiliated the country by mishandling his letter to the French President calling for international action, which ended with the Home Secretary banned from talks with European partners. Talk about an own goal.  But the international blame game won’t help anyone. The French and British Governments must show leadership, sit down together and urgently fix this humanitarian crisis. Simply trying to stop smugglers launching boats off French beaches isn’t working. We need cross-country working and better efforts between law enforcers in Britain and Europe. This must come with deals for safe s, which the Government has failed to negotiate since the UK left the regulation enabling some asylum seekers’to EU countries. There are also desperate people who need our help and should be able to travel safely and legally to the UK. The Government promised to help , unaccompanied children but ended the scheme after aiding just . It should be reopened urgently. Failure to provide safe, legal routes results in more people risking their lives on small boats. The Government must get a grip of this deadly mess, or further tragedy is inevitable.

Dr Angelique Coetzee says she was first alerted to the possibility of a new iant when patients at her Pretoria private practice had Covid symptoms that did not make sense. They included young people from a range of dferent backgrounds all with intense fatigue and a six-year-old child with a high pulse rate. None of them suffered from a loss of taste or smell, both symptoms which are heavily associated with apostraditionalapos Covid. “Their symptoms were so dferent and so mild from those I had treated before,” said Dr Coetzee, a GP for  years who also chairs South Africa’s Medical Association.  On November , when four family members all tested positive for Covid with complete exhaustion, she informed the country’s vaccine advisory committee. She said in total about two dozen of her patients have tested positive Covid with symptoms of Omicron - which the world is now scrambling to contain with ious travel bans. They were mostly healthy men who turned up “feeling so tired and about half of them had not even had a single dose - a prevalent issue in South Africa and in swathes of the African continent.  South African scientists say Omicron is behind a sharp rise of cases in the country’s Gauteng province. In the UK, the government has slapped several southern Africa countries on the red travel list - although small numbers of cases have been reported across Europe. There are two confirmed omicron cases in the UK.All international arrivals will have to take a PCR test by the end of their second day in the UK, Boris Johnson announced yesterday evening as he prepared to reimpose measures to control the spread of coronavirus over fears the new strain could evade existing vaccines. The Prime Minister said the temporary and precautionary measures will be reviewed in three weeks, while the Governmentaposs vaccine experts will be tasked with considering whether to extend booster jabs to all over-s.Health Secretary Sajid Javid will be questioned on the details of the restrictions, including on when exactly they will be introduced, during broadcast interviews on Sunday.Mr Johnson announced the strengthening of Englandaposs rules at a Downing Street press conference, after two cases of Omicron were identied, in Nottingham and Brentwood, Essex, with both linked to travel to southern Africa.

While a reference in the Latin version to ldquoRegem angelorum, meaning lsquoking of the angels, may instead be an anti-Hanoverian message of opposition to King George II.Dr Bradley says there is a string of indicators to suggest there is more to the carol than a celebration of the infant Jesus.ldquoThe early manuscript mentions lsquoour King Jamesrsquo in Latin, which appears to be a reference to the Old Pretender, James Francis Edward Stuart, son of James VII.ldquoAnd there are Stuart cyphers and thistle decorations.ldquoWade was a plain-chant scribe who had gone to France almost as an exile, where he copied manuscripts and taught Latin. As you might expect from an English Catholic college in exile, they did not have much time for Hanoverians.The song was sung only in Roman Catholic places of worship for decades, while carols ndash even those which praised Jesus and celebrated his birth ndash were shunned where.ldquoThey were very much seen as rather vulgar and populist and did not come into the Church of England until  and in Scotland until the end of the th century, he adds.ldquoInstead, they were sung outside in the street, outside pubs and homes where the church did not have so much control.St Francis of Assisi ndash regarded as lsquothe Father of Christmas Carols ndash is said to have inspired the birth of the Christmas carol in the th century after he created nativity scenes in a cave and invited people to sing and worship around a manger.But while Franciscan friars brought songs praising the Christmas story from Italy, churches preferred hymns based strictly on the scriptures, and viewed carols as having Pagan connections, associated with fertility rituals.ldquoWhen we look at the earliest use of the word lsquocarolrsquo in English language in the s, it seems to be a round dance with singing associated with fertility, and no religious signicance, Prof. Bradley adds.ldquoFranciscan friars were bringing songs to the people here, they picked them up and would sing in streets, homes and pubs, but not in church.As carols became more popular, their role for delivering hidden messages grew, he adds.ldquoThe Twelve Days of Christmas was possibly a Catholic song used to teach Catholic doctrine - the five gold rings are the five sacraments of the Catholic Church.ldquoThis was possibly post-Reformation, and the song used to teach tenets of Catholic faith when they were forbidden to practise their faith.While another, Angels from the Realms of Glory, is believed to contain subversive messages from its author, James Montgomery, a Scots-born political radical who had been twice imprisoned for his support of the French Revolution and reform riots in Britain.ldquoThe original last verse talked about justice repelling the sentence of those who had been in prison and mercy breaking the chains, adds Dr Bradley.Perhaps more in the spirit of Christmas, It Came Upon the Midnight Clear contains a message of peace and a call for an end to stre, written by Edmund Sears, a minister in Massachusetts with strong liberal views who wanted peace and social reform.ldquoHe wrote it after there had been particularly bloody revolutions in Europe and a costly war between the United States and Mexico, and it contains the words lsquoO hush the noise, ye men of stre, and hear the angels singrsquo, adds Dr Bradley.ldquoItrsquos a fairly universal sentiment but tempered by his own political instinct.Prof. Bradley will reveal the secrets behind Christmas carols during a talk next Fridayat Scotlandrsquos first religious literary festival, organised by the School of Divinity at the University of Edinburgh.The festival, part of celebrations to mark the th anniversary of New College, the home of the School of Divinity, features a programme of  events, including an exploration of the relationship between religion and crime writing in a presentation by crime author Val McDermid.Best-selling author Robert Harris will discuss portrayals of power, religion and politics in his work, including Fatherland, Enigma and the Cicero trilogy.Acclaimed author Charles Foster and broadcaster Sally Magnusson will also take part, while actor, comedian and writer, Miles Jupp will explore the complex connections between religion, comedy and literature.The festival runs between December -.

Local media reports in Kharkiv say he is out of the country. He has, in his absence, been formally arrested.The former official has been accused of sending  million Hryvna - about  million dollars and half a million euros - to a Scottish limited partnership or SLP called Portvilla Trading.The money was supposed to be an agency fee for the m export of two Antonov An- military transport planes to the Kazakh secret service. The payments were made between  and .As The Herald reported back in , the Kazakhs said they had had no contact with Portvilla and, according to prosecutors, the business had played no role in the deal.Suntsov is just the latest high profile figure in Ukrainian business and politics to be linked with the abuse of SLPs or other ldquooffshore companies in Ukraine.His factory - once a signicant and militarily strategic employer - has struggled in recent years. Workers - who have suffered late wage payments - are furious about what they call the ldquo million scandal.The Kharkiv plant has been politically important too. Suntsovrsquos old boss, Anatoliy Myalitsa, rose up through the Soviet ranks to be a member of the central committee of the Communist Party under Mikhail Gorbachev.He then went on to be a ldquohero of Ukraine - an official honour - and the countryrsquos industry minister. All while working in one capacity or another at the Kharkiv plant. Myalitsa died earlier this year.Corruption at an institution as economically and politically and strategically important as the Kharkiv plant is a serious business.But it is the alleged use of a British shell company to skim from an arms deal that got policy-makers in the UK worried.Back in  then SNP MP Roger Mullin was so alarmed by reports of SLP abuse in Kharkiv arms deals that he called for then security minister Ben Wallace to investigate the case.Now an ambassador for the Transparency Task Force - linked to Transparency International, Mr Mullin warned that opaque shell firms still posed a danger.\"It is six years since I first raised concerns about SLPs at Westminster. Despite some limited progress, it is still the case that SLPs are far too easy to use for international criminal activity, the case of Ukraine being but one example, Mullin said.ldquoThere is a fundamental problem in that the UK government have always been reluctant to close the areas that make it easy to use SLPs for criminal activity. \"The Scottish Government does not have the powers to deal with SLPs, but they do have a voice and I hope will use it to put serious pressure on the UK government to act.ldquoTo have Scotlands name dragged into such criminal enterprises harms our reputation. The corrupt and criminals involved in using SLPs to cover their tracks must be laughing all the way to their banks at the ineptitude of the UK government and those agencies that are supposed to prevent using our financial vehicles for criminal activity.Westminster is responsible for primary legislation on Scots corporate law. UK officials have acknowledged the problem. In  they announced that SLPs would have to declare beneficial owners. This - along with a crackdown on offshore banking in the Baltic states- brought a reduction in the number of new partnerships being formed.However, abuse continues. A major EU-wide investigation in to multi-million-euro investment frauds this year traced proceeds of crime to SLPs run out of Ukraine. Some of the victims were British. The SLPs were formed after the first reforms.The UK Government has vowed further moves to toughen up the rules around SLPs and how they and other shell firms are policed. Some critics say these are too little, too late. Others say they are a good start.Portvilla Trading is still on the books at Britainrsquos corporate register, Companies House. It has never complied with new rules under which it should have named any beneficial owners.Until late , it was registered at a flat in Edinburgh which has been home to thousands of SLPs and other enterprises.Its official address was them moved to that of an accountancy firm in Douglas, South Lanarkshire.There is no suggestion that the address providers knew anything about the alleged criminality carried out by any entity they host.Another Douglas-based SLP remains at the centre of another major and live arms corruption investigation in Ukraine. Fuerteventura Inter, like Portvilla Trading, has been under investigation by Nabu for years.

It may be because things are so delicate that small movements have produced big changes.The also note that high levels of vaccination and high levels of infectiousness - as per the Delta strain - is ldquonew territory.: Scottish Government Covid advisors optimistic about run up to ChristmasTo understand why experts are perplexed, however, it is worth remembering just how dire some of the modelling for England was in the run up to its lsquoFreedom Dayrsquo on July , the date when nightclubs reopened, social distancing ended, and mandatory facemasks and work-from-home diktats were scrapped.In the weeks before, cases were climbing rapidly and reached , on July .Modellers forecast that Freedom Day would quickly propel England to , cases a day with hospitalisations potentially exceeding the winter Alpha wave.Hospital admissions in England have remained fairly high, but flat, in comparison to Scotland where admissions surged in SeptemberInstead, confirmed infections fell rapidly to around , by the end of July and have hovered ever since in a range of around ,-, per day.Hospital admissions have also remained steady at - per day, a quarter of the January peak.In contrast, Scotland - which delayed its Freedom Day equivalent until August  and maintained masks and home working - saw cases rocket nearly five-fold in less than four weeks, reaching more than , by the beginning of September.Peak hospitalisations, at  per day, were nudging levels seen at the height of wave one.And while infections have largely plateaued in Scotland since the beginning of October, the two nationsrsquo case rates are closer together than any other parts of the UK despite their respective governments very dferent approaches to the pandemic:  per , in Scotland, and  per , in England.Source: Public Health EnglandMask critics have pointed to the experience in Scotland - and Western Europe - compared to England as evidence that they are a useless mitigation.But John Burn-Murdoch, a visiting senior fellow at London School of EconomicsData Science, whose work on Covid statistics is widely acclaimed, described the focus on masks in October as ldquooverly simplistic, politicised and at times flat-out wrong.By mid to late-September in Scotland - where masks were required in shops, schools, public transport, and hospitality - weekly Covid case rates in the over-s, hospitalisations per , and deaths per million were roughly twice as high in Scotland as England.And herersquos the second set of charts, again separating Eng + Scot:bull Itrsquos true: Scottish governmentrsquos mask guidance means no-masking remains much less common there ##bull But when it comes to mixing in large groups and crowded spaces, Eng  Scot are almost exactly the same pic mWnAAnMoBut, crucially, once masks were set aside, behaviours were almost identical in both nations in terms of public transport use and socialising in large gatherings or crowded spaces.As Burn-Murdoch stressed, this is not proof that masks do not reduce incidence - they do, by around % - but that the benefit may be outweighed by other factors which more strongly encourage transmission.ldquoJust because masks are the most visible thing and the most easy for identying lsquobad peoplersquo to make ourselves feel a little better, theyrsquore not the only factor or even the most important, he said.: Vaccine passports will not be extended to pubs, cinemas and restaurants - for nowDavid Male, a professor of biology at the Open University who specialises in immunology, vaccines and iants, said the most likely answer is that Scotland coincided its lsquoBeyond Zerorsquo phase with schools ing in England, pupils went back six weeks after Freedom Day.ldquoI do think that quite probably the coincidence of those two things is responsible for that spike, said Male.ldquoBecauseyou take out that spike at the end of the summer in Scotland, whatrsquos happening across the United Kingdom is pretty similar in all four nations.He added that while masks have little impact on exponential growth, they become more important once cases are flat.ldquoIf yoursquove got an epidemic thatrsquos really taking off like it is in Austria, it needs more than mask wearing to get a hold of it.\"Butyoursquove got something like what we have in the UK, measures like mask wearing can make the dference between the R value being above one and being below one, which makes a dference between the epidemic spreading or dying out.ldquoA small change in the rate of transmission now could, in six weeksrsquo time, make a big dference to the incidence.Another theory is that Scotland paid the price for having had a lower prevalence of the virus compared to England earlier in the pandemic.: Why the new Omicron iant has scientists scaredProfessor Rowland Kao, chair of veterinary epidemiology and data science at Edinburgh University, believes this could have been key.He said: ldquoIn an ironic way -you did better before you have less immunity now. Immunity obviously declines, but a fair bit sticks around.ldquoGiven that, broadly speaking, Scotland has done better over the course of the pandemic it means that the proportion of iniduals exposed to the disease is lower, and that means yoursquove got less population immunity.It is certainly true that by the end of July, a higher percentage of adults in England than Scotland were testing positive for Covid antibodies - but the gap was just .%: .% compared to .%.In some age groups though the dference was wider: for example,roughly eight in  over-s in Scotland had antibodies against nine in  in England.Rowland KaoIt is dficult to say whether this was enough to swing the epidemic, but there is a growing consensus that the UKrsquos earlier and consistently higher exposure to Delta compared to Europe is now paying off - coupled with earlier booster rollouts.Whether or not that was necessarily the best move for the NHS overall is less clear, however.ldquoItrsquos exactly the same argument as there was about herd immunity a year and a half ago, ldquosaid Kao.ldquoOne of the things that we donrsquot know the answers to yet is whether that sort of continuous stream of people into the health service has been a net benefit or a net detriment, because that will obviously have a knock on effect for other procedures not being done.Professor Adam Kleczkowski, mathematical biology at Strathclyde University, admits to being ldquopuzzled by Covid trends in England since summer.ldquoThe best explanation on what is going on in England at the moment is that it has reached something like lsquoendemicityrsquo, i.e. a state when the population immunityis so high that the reproductive number is close to one, even withcomplete relaxation.ldquoWhat we see now is, firstly, the pandemic lsquoburning throughrsquo the remaining susceptiblesand, secondly, infecting those whom vaccine waning made susceptible again. vs England- courtesy of Professor Adam Kleczkowski\" alt\"HeraldScotland: Daily reported cases up to November , by age group, Scotlandvs England- courtesy of Professor Adam Kleczkowski\" class\"editor-image\"Daily reported cases up to November , by age group, Scotlandvs England- courtesy of Professor Adam KleczkowskiComparing the countriesrsquo infections by age group, though, it is clear that both experienced post-summer surges in the -

the percentage of the population infected at any one time - surveillance indicates that England has been consistently higher recently.\"The main dference between Scotland and England in recent months is the big peak of cases at the beginning of the school year,\" said Kleczkowski.\"Except for this mid-August to mid-September peak, England has a higher percentage of cases than Scotland throughout the Autumn.\"As for the weeks ahead, the new B... iant may well be a game-changer, necessitating much tougher measures than would ever be required with Delta should begin spreading in the UK and Europe.Meanwhile, European regulators have just approved the Pfizer vaccine for five to -year-olds, a decision Englands chief medical officer Chris Whitty insists remains far off for the UK.So will Englands policy of boosters and \"letting rip\" continue to outperform Western Europe - or should Scotland emulate continental precautions such as vaccine passports just in case \"It is a very interesting topic, but it is too early to say,\" said Kleczkowski.\"The answer would depend on what happens over the next few weeks - will cases in England follow the current [European] trend, while Western Europe suppresses the peak \"Or, would the Western Europe peak be so massive as to make it look like a basket case, and England just trots slowly, flattening the curve, but with a massive death toll \""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13085594.jpg?type=article-full","title":"first-hampden-park-campaigners-bid-world-heritage-site-status","story":"Just a year later, the original Hampden Park opened on October , , and became home to Queenrsquos Park FC and the Scotland national team until .It closed due to the building of the Cathcart Circle railway line.Last month archaeological experts finally proved that what is now known as Hampden Bowling Club is the site of the first national stadium.Read more:Extra time secured for club on site of historic first Hampden ParkArchaeological digs proved that records found by Hampden devotee Graeme Brown, which suggested the bowling club site was the first Hampden Park, and now a campaign is due to be launched this week with the hope of securing UNESCO World Heritage status for the place where it is considered football began.Campaigners believe the site should have world heritage statusTomorrow a virtual meeting of experts and enthusiast will join together to discuss the history and legacy of the first Hampden and explore the stance that Scots led the way for the modern game which is played and watched by millions around the world.The evidence to back up records discovered by Mr Brown, of the Hampden Collection initiative, came just weeks after the site was given a reprieve when it was feared Hampden Bowling Club itself might have been in jeopardy. Members managed to elect a new committee and secure time to be able to carry out a structural report for repairs to the clubhouse. Had they been unable to elect a committee the lease would have been lost with the site reverting back to arms- council organisation City Property.Former Scotland and Queens Park player Joseph TaylorIn  Mr Brown, who was then with Hampden Bowling Club, discovered a railway map proving Hampden Bowling Clubrsquos legendary tale and this year digs were carried out in a bid for hard evidence. And with  months to go before the th anniversary of the first international, Mr Brown believes now is the time for Scotlandrsquos contribution to football to be recognised and the site of the first Hampden being protected.Read more:Scotlands first national football ground faces uncertain futureMr Brown leads what has become known as The Hampden Collection and Footballrsquos Square Mile - the Worldrsquos Biggest lsquoOpen Airrsquo football museum in Glasgow which follows the discovery of the foundation stone of the Worldrsquos first enclosed purposefully built international football ground.Mr Brown, who will bring together a  of guests for the event, said: ldquoThe next stage of the footballing journey is to get the entire st Hampden Site recognised as the epicentre of World Football. However, to do that, and to bring the story to le, we have brought in a number of other sites that have huge signicance in the story of football, and as launched earlier this year, created the worldrsquos biggest open air football museum.ldquoIn our opinion, this is the way to stamp Scotlandrsquos claim, and also brings huge amount of opportunity to tell this story. Footballrsquos Square Mile is the way to do it and the campaign to make it a UNESCO World Heritage Site will be launched this week which will be one year to go until the th anniversary of the worlds first international football match.Joseph Taylors great grandson Colin discovered the grave in Cathcart CemeteryMr Brown realises it will be a dficult process, but says they are ready for the campaign.ldquoWith the timing and signicant dates next year, along with the possibility that Scotland could be playing at the World Cup, we want to put the spotlight on just how important the discovery of the first Hampden and Footballrsquos Square Mile is. If this was anywhere  in the world that could lay claim to the beginning of football as we know it, it would be a world tourist attraction so why not here.Carrying out a geophysical survey, as well as excavating six trenches in the Queens Park Recreation Ground and Kingsley Gardens site, the archaeologists revealed evidence of the foundations of the first Hampden Park pavilion where the first players to play for Queens Park and Scotland would have got changed before matches and where the team officials would have sat.One of the sites on the Hampden walking tourThey also found tantalising evidence of the original playing surface, sealed beneath over a century of earth and grass, as well as numerous artefacts dropped by the early supporters including beer bottles, juice bottles and clay pipes.Dr Paul Murtagh, Senior Project Officer at Archaeology Scotland who managed the st Hampden Dig Team, said the project was unique in more ways than one as it brought people together.Dr Murtagh said: ldquoThis was a project which was part of Archaeology Scotlandrsquos New Audience Project, funded by Historic Environment Scotland, and brought people from dferent backgrounds and nationalities together. Football was the hook for this and while it not be their own countryrsquos heritage they were helping to establish part footballing heritage.ldquoWe were very lucky to have records to got on but it was when we dug the trenches and with the use of geophysics we could really pinpoint the site. The findings, which included artefacts from people who would have stood on the terraces, really give you something tangible from that moment in time.A group enjoying the Hampden tourGlasgow Football Tour founder Lindsay Hamilton had been aware of the myth surrounding the site of the first Hampden Park, but like many people didnrsquot think much more of it.It was only when Mr Brown approached her to consider working on a Hampden walking tour that she found out more.ldquoIrsquove been offering tours around Glasgowrsquos five main stadiums for many years and I love telling people about our footballing heritage, said Ms Hamilton. ldquoBefore covid I had been taking tourists from all over the world to Hampden Park, Ibrox Stadium, Celtic Park, Cathkin Park and Firhill as well as part of a -minute minibus tour.ldquoGraeme was on my first tour and I remember him saying to me do you want to help me save Hampden Bowling Club and I wondered what he was talking about, but it was the rumour that it was the site of the first Hampden which Graeme then went on to find the map from the National Records of Scotland which showed where it would have been.Due to covid restrictions Ms Hamiltonrsquos minibus tours of the football grounds couldnrsquot go ahead, so a walking tour of the Hampden sites was developed.ldquoThe idea came about for the walking tour bringing in the three Hampden sites and was a chance to be able to tell the story of and signicance of the beginning of world football and the game we know today, Ms Hamilton added.ldquoPeople were keen to get outdoors and embraced walking more during lockdown and we ran nine walking tours this year. When you tell people about the history behind the first Hampden Park they are in disbelief. I think people on the tour, who were all Scottish as we still didnrsquot have international visitors at the time, felt very proud and we want people to go on tell the story and pass it on. The first Hampden needs to be protected and should be celebrated as the site where the modern game watched by billions around the world began.One football fan who joined the tour had a particular interest in Scotlandrsquos football heritage as he is very much part of it.Colin Taylor, the great grandson of Joseph Taylor, was drawn to the tour on his first trip to Glasgow to investigate his football history.ldquoI was always told as a youngster that Joseph Taylor played football for Queens Park, Colin said. ldquoLater I was told he also played for Scotland, but kind of took that with a pinch of salt. When my father passed away in  I started to get interested in family history and with my fatherrsquos brother, my paternal uncle, who was by then in his mid s, started looking through old photos and we found one of Joseph and one of his grave. My uncle said he had looked for Josephrsquos grave in the rsquos but assumed it was in Langside and thought it had been lost during bombing in the Second World War.Ten yearsrsquo ago Colin discovered the location of Taylorrsquos grave by accident.Colin added: ldquoIt was a simple email to Cathcart, I emailed every cemetery in Glasgow, and I discovered where he rested. I was also contacted by the historian Andy Mitchell who sent me more information on Joseph and a photo of his grave.ldquoI saw an opportunity this year after lockdown to go to Scotland for a few days and visit Josephrsquos grave and visit Hampden. I was intrigued by the three Hampdenrsquos story and the discovery of the very first Hampden.ldquoI joined a walking tour in September and I achieved my ambition of seeing Josephrsquos grave, seeing the original Hampden where he played, and Queenrsquos Park where he also played and practised.I could feel goosebumps looking at the old pavilion at the bowling club and imagining Joseph not only playing there but also being instrumental in some major decisions as he was president of Queens Park for a year after he finished playing in ."},{"url":null,"title":"omicron-two-people-uk-found-infected-new-covid-19-variant","story":"The two cases of the Omicron Covid- iant have been discovered in Chelmsford and in Nottingham, the Department of Health  Social Care said.The iniduals that have tested positive, and all members of their households, are being re-tested and told to self-isolate while further testing and contact tracing is under way, it added.ldquoThe UK Health Security Agency is carrying out targeted testing at locations where the positive cases were likely to have been infectious, the department said.ldquoIn response to the developing situation, the UK is taking decisive action to protect public health.

More than  people and organisations contributed to the Toolkit, whose development was supported by the Scottish Government.And Stromness will be among the communities highlighted as a prime example of success as the toolkit is discussed at the Scotland’s Towns Conference on Friday, November .The toolkit highlights how more than a decade of investment has helped revitalise the area, including the new £m Copland’s dock, the Orkney Research and Innovation Campus, and the creation of a new arts centre.Explaining the reasons for the community’s success, town planner Nick Wright, who developed the toolkit for STP and will highlight Stromness at the conference, said: “Everyone pulls together, making the most of every opportunity.“This is an ambitious community where people aren’t afraid to muck in and make things happen — with strong political will and a clear plan of modernising Stromness while maintaining its historical elegance.”That work includes the  year multi-million pound investments secured from the Lottery and Historic Environment Scotland to restore and modernise the town centre. Working with local landowners and organisations, these schemes restored  vacant or dilapidated historic buildings, improved shops, created new business spaces, and revitalised the town’s streets and spaces.Nick Wright added: “This toolkit is about sharing that wealth of experience from across the country — showing that you can do it because it’s been done before. It’s about how to make things happen — a one-stop-shop on how to make towns the best they can be.”While inspiring communities and groups, it is also hoped that the toolkit will prove useful for local authority officials working in planning, community development, leisure, transport and the economy when considering developments in their region, as well as for politicians at every level.For more information, go to www.towntoolkit.scot.

It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CoGCGraduation_AlainaMaclennan_PrizeWinner-2-scaled.jpg","title":"skye graduate wins college","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe HND Sports Coaching graduate celebrated at the college’s ceremony held on Mondayin the city’s Royal Concert Hall. Alaina, who attended Plockton High School, and lives in Kyleakin, was surprised and delighted to win the prize, saying: #I am happy that my hard work during my time at college, and through the challenges of adapting to remote learning due to Covid-, have paid off.  “City of Glasgow College gave me the good foundation I needed to build and develop my future career in sports coaching.

However, the service and sacrice of all those who fought in the First World War continues to be remembered,” Sir Jeffrey said.“There is also a growing recognition that those who fought came from dferent backgrounds, but were in the trenches with a united goal. The war truly is part of our shared history and it is fitting that so many have travelled from Northern Ireland to mark the centenary of the tower.”Sir Jeffrey also paid tribute to the Somme Association for ensuring the Ulster Tower and Thiepval Wood are maintained to commemorate the past and keep those stories alive for future generations.

Stephanie Scott, Home from Home Co-ordinator at Ballymena said: “Casper is a very sweet natured boy with a lovely character who loves playing with his toys especially a ball. “He also has a sensitive side where he can be shy and anxious about open spaces and leaving what he considers to be his safe places. “We noticed this when he first came into kennels when he didn’t want to leave his kennel, so we felt that he would cope better in a foster home and he is enjoying le with his foster family who are patient and kind. “However, placing a dog in a foster home is only ever a temporary measure so it is now time for Casper to find his new family.“Casper is happy and content when he spends time with his foster family in the house or garden but upon leaving this space for walks he can become nervous. “We think many people will be able to relate to Casper’s worries following the pandemic when going out into the world again can lead to anxiety.“Casper very much enjoys company and is an affectionate dog once he knows you. “He likes someone being around most of the time and in his foster home he likes to sleep in the bedroom area. We know that whoever rehomes Casper will be getting a devoted canine pal for le.”Casper requires a quiet, adult only home as the only pet.

Picture by Hollie AdamsGetty Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBoris Johnson yesterday announces everyone entering UK will need to do PCR test. Picture by Hollie AdamsRodney EdwardsTwitterEmailNovember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailNorthern Ireland is to introduce new PCR testing and self-isolation requirements for new arrivals after the emergence of the new Omicron iant of Covid- in England yesterday.Anyone arriving in the region will be asked to take a PCR test for Covid- on the second day and must self-isolate until they provide a negative result after the new “concerning” strain was discovered in Nottingham and Essex.In a statement last night, Northern Ireland chief medical officer Professor Sir Michael McBride confirmed it is the Department of Health’s intention to align Northern Ireland with the rest of the UK on PCR testing and self-isolation requirements for new arrivals.“While it is highly likely that there will be cases of the iant in Northern Ireland at some point it is essential that preventative measures are taken to delay and or reduce its incursion,” he said.Mr McBride described the new iant as a “serious and concerning development” and spent much of the weekend discussing it with his counterparts in the UK and the Republic.Northern Ireland Health Minister Robin Swann is said to be in constant contact with his counterpart in the Republic, Stephen Donnelly, about the ever-changing picture.Mr Swann has also been briefing Stormont Ministers on actions his Department are taking to “reduce and delay” the impact of the Omicron should it reach here, including adding additional countries to the red list in line with the UK and a push on the vaccination programme.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Malawi and Mozambique were added to the NI red list on November  while Angola and Zambia will be included from am today. They join South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Eswatini already on the list.It is understood there are three main areas of concern for Stormont’s health officialsthe new iant is problematic: the effectiveness of the vaccine, the clinical impact on the region’s already pressurised hospitals and its transmissibility.Almost three million vaccinations have been administered to the public here in the form of first, second and in some cases third vaccines or boosters. More than , people were tested for the disease in the past week.It is hoped such readiness will help in the fight against the latest iant.However, Northern Ireland still has the highest infection rate in the UK or Ireland and the lowest vaccination rate, though the numbers of people in hospital with the virus are decreasing slowly.Mid Ulster Mid and East Antrim Antrim and Newtownabbey and Causeway Coast and Glens have had notably high infection rates of above  cases per , population.There was some optimism yesterday when a scientist behind the Oxford vaccination spoke favourably that the existing vaccines will be effective against Omicron and that it is “extremely unlikely” that it will cause a “reboot” of the pandemic — a sentiment echoed by Tánaiste Leo Varadkar.Professor Andrew Pollard, who helped create the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, said experts would need to wait “several weeks” for confirmation but said existing jabs could still be effective at presenting serious illness.As well as the UK, several cases of the iant have been identied in Belgium, Germany, the Czech republic, Botswana, Hong Kong and Israel.More than  people who arrived in the Netherlands on two flights from South Africa on Friday tested positive for Covid. Dutch authorities are trying to establish whether the passengers have the new iant.The World Health Organisation has said the iant has been detected at faster rates than previous surges in infection.However, little is known about it, specically whether it will escape vaccines.In the Republic, scientists have begun analysing data taken from samples dating to the start of November at its Backweston facility for markers of the new iant.Yesterday, Cillian De Gascún, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, said he hopes to have preliminary data tomorrow on whether the new iant has been detected in Ireland.Dr De Gascún said he was concerned about the new iant, but that it was too early to tell how prevalent it could become. He said there was no evidence yet that it would evade vaccines or cause more severe disease.However, he added, information emerging from South Africa suggests it is even more transmissible.Mr Martin said the new restrictions coupled with the booster vaccine campaign will ensure “intergenerational engagement that will happen around Christmas time will be less hazardous for the vulnerable”.However, the Ombudsman for Children Dr Niall Muldoon said he expects the Government to have “robust plans” to protect access to school, education support and social interaction.“We are approaching the third calendar year of this pandemic and there are still challenging times ahead,” he said.Meanwhile, the new Covid certication scheme here in Northern Ireland will not be mandatory in unlicensed premises “at this stage”, the Department of Health has said.Under the policy, which will be introduced in draft form tomorrow, people wishing to gain entry to designated venues will need to demonstrate evidence of Covid- vaccination, a negative lateral flow test result or proof of infection in the previous six months.But such a scheme would require Assembly approval.Most ReadA forever family home in south Belfast’s Upper Malone RoadPrincipal killed after falling tree struck his car was ‘a giant in his prime’Where old meets new: Killough home is full of period charmOrganisers of loyalist event in Co Tyrone ‘were not to blame for sectarian incidents’Warning of NI schools early Christmas closure and remote learning Top VideosPlayVideo: Portstewart front covered in seafoam as Storm Arwen landsPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolatePlayJurgen Klopp lauds #exceptional# Diogo JotaLatest Northern IrelandFuneral of NI principal killed by falling tree during storm to take place on TuesdayDean Shiels fumes over fixture schedule: ‘Would it happen to Glentoran  Not a chance… but we are only little Dungannon’Funding will allow artists to work alongside pupils in creative learning projectsChristy Manzinga and Kyle McClean lauded as Linfield ease past Glenavon to go thirdMark Allen targeting ‘multiple title’ victories after reaching round three at UK ChampionshipLatestFuneral of NI principal killed by falling tree during storm to take place on TuesdayDean Shiels fumes over fixture schedule: ‘Would it happen to Glentoran  Not a chance… but we are only little Dungannon’Funding will allow artists to work alongside pupils in creative learning projectsEllen White aiming to eclipse the ‘outrageous’ Kelly Smith’s England goal tallyDarren CaveOpinionLeinster were as bad as I’ve seen them but only because of the pressure Ulster piled on,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Martin McKeownGillian AndersonNovember   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailA council investigation into reports of sectarian singing and comments at a young loyalist event in Co Tyrone has cleared the organisers of blame.The report concluded that while the incidents at the event organised by Castlederg Young Loyalists on July  in Castlederg were ‘unfortunate, it could not be determined to be a fault of the organisers’.However, councillors decided not to accept the officer’s recommendation to award the funding which had previously been withheld. A new investigation into the incident will now be held.Sinn Fein councillor Ruairi McHugh had previously raised the matter at the July council meeting, describing the event as descending into a ‘sectarian hatefest’. He also pointed out that the council-maintained car park was ‘bedecked in loyalist and unionist flags and paraphernalia’.The concert, at Albert Street car park in Castlederg, had been allocated £, from the council’s Good Relations Fund. Councillors voted in favour of the investigation with the funding withheld until the outcome was reported.In a report to the health and communities committee, it noted that members should “approve that Grant Aid payments are made to Castlederg Young Loyalists in line with the terms and conditions of their Letter of Offer within the Good Relations Grant Aid Programmes”.It added: “The organisers are aware that an inidual, under the influence of alcohol, made sectarian comments following a performance by one of several acts on the night of July . This was dealt with promptly by the organisers.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up It added: “Whilst this incident was unfortunate, it could not be determined to be the fault of the organisers. The incident was dealt with promptly as far as was possible and the organisers offered both an explanation and apology to the public and to council as the funder.”Sinn Fein councillor Ruairi McHugh said the report amounted to a watering down of what happened that night.”SDLP councillor Brian Tierney added his disappointment that ‘the term investigation was used’.He said: “I just don’t knowwe have done due diligence with this. We haven’t spoken to anyone outside the event organisers about this.”Defending the report UUP Alderman Derek Hussey said: “I am disappointed with some of the rhetoric around this and the vilication of the organisers of this event on the back of a report which is a very factual account of events as I have heard.DUP Alderman Maurice Devenney said the report clearly states “there was no breach in terms and conditions”.Members voted against the officer’s recommendation to award the funding with three for, seven against and one abstention.

South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Eswatini are already on the list. All countries had been cleared from the UK’s red travel list in October. A statement from the Department of Health said the action was taken after close liaison with other departments in the UK and Republic of Ireland. It is their intention to align Northern Ireland with the rest of the UK on PCR testing and self-isolation requirements for new arrivals, they said.Chief Medical Officer Professor Sir Michael McBride said the emergence of the omicron iant is a serious and concerning development following the extreme pressures already faced during the course of the Covid- pandemic to date.Whilst it is highly likely that there will be cases of the iant in NI at some point it is essential that preventative measures are taken to delay and or reduce its incursion. This is a rapidly developing situation with the potential need for the addition of more countries to the Red List in the coming days, he said.Dr McBride concluded: “It is really important that everyone takes sensible precautions - get a PCR testyou have symptoms. self-isolate when asked and wear your face-covering. Remember to ventilate rooms and please get your vaccine and boosters as soon as you can.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Most ReadA forever family home in south Belfast’s Upper Malone RoadPrincipal killed after falling tree struck his car was ‘a giant in his prime’Where old meets new: Killough home is full of period charmOrganisers of loyalist event in Co Tyrone ‘were not to blame for sectarian incidents’Warning of NI schools early Christmas closure and remote learning Top VideosPlayVideo: Portstewart front covered in seafoam as Storm Arwen landsPlayVideo: Inside Elk teen disco linked with  Covid cases and  having to self-isolatePlayJurgen Klopp lauds #exceptional# Diogo JotaLatest Northern IrelandFuneral of NI principal killed by falling tree during storm to take place on TuesdayDean Shiels fumes over fixture schedule: ‘Would it happen to Glentoran  Not a chance… but we are only little Dungannon’Funding will allow artists to work alongside pupils in creative learning projectsChristy Manzinga and Kyle McClean lauded as Linfield ease past Glenavon to go thirdMark Allen targeting ‘multiple title’ victories after reaching round three at UK ChampionshipLatestFuneral of NI principal killed by falling tree during storm to take place on TuesdayDean Shiels fumes over fixture schedule: ‘Would it happen to Glentoran  Not a chance… but we are only little Dungannon’Funding will allow artists to work alongside pupils in creative learning projectsEllen White aiming to eclipse the ‘outrageous’ Kelly Smith’s England goal tallyDarren CaveOpinionLeinster were as bad as I’ve seen them but only because of the pressure Ulster piled on,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Both were asymptomatic and vaccinated against Covid-. The remaining  have been placed in quarantine.Neighbouring New Zealand announced it is restricting travel from nine southern African countries because of the threat posed by the iant, and Japan widened its border controls to include more countries from the region.Tourist-dependent Thailand, which only recently began loosening its tight border restrictions to leisure travellers from certain countries, announced a ban of its own on visitors from eight African counties.Similar restrictions took effect in the business hub of Singapore, which is barring entry and transit to anyone with a recent history of travel to seven southern African nations.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news aca .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdc-e--a-bea_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news

nationals, mandating quarantine for all Israelis arriving from abroad and red-listing travel to  African countries.It also approved use of the Shin Bet internal security agency’s controversial phone monitoring technology to perform contact tracing of iniduals confirmed with the new iant.The tighter restrictions reflect steps rapidly taken by countries around the world to limit the spread of the Omicron iant just days after it was identied by researchers in South Africa.The “act first, ask questions later” approach reflects growing alarm about the emergence of a potentially more contagious iant nearly two years into a pandemic that has killed more than five million people, turned lives upside down, and disrupted economies across the globe.While much remains to be learned about the new iant, researchers are concerned that it may be more resistant to the protection provided by vaccines and could mean that the pandemic lasts for longer than anticipated.Cases involving the Omicron iant have already been confirmed on multiple continents, with Germany, Italy, Belgium, Israel and Hong Kong all reporting cases in recent days.David Hui, a respiratory medicine expert and government adviser on the pandemic in Hong Kong, said that even though it is not clearcurrent coronavirus vaccines are effective against the new iant, the city’s vaccination rate should be increased and that “booster doses should be implemented as soon” as possible.He said the two people who tested positive for the Omicron iant had received the Pfizer jab and exhibited very mild symptoms, such as a sore throat.“Vaccines should work but there would be some reduction in effectiveness,” he said.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news world-news ebb .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_fdc-e--a-bea_embedded

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThere are concerns the Omicron iant is more transmissible than the Delta iant The United States’ top infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, said he would not be surprisedthe new strain is already in the US too.“We have not detected it yet, but when you have a virus that is showing this degree of transmissibility … it almost iniably is ultimately going to go essentially all over,” he said on NBC television.In Australia, the New South Wales health department said the infected travellers arrived from one of nine African countries that are now required to quarantine in a hotel upon arrival in Sydney – South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia, Eswatini, Malawi and the Seychelles.New Zealand’s Covid- Response Minister, Chris Hipkins, said the island nation is taking a precautionary approach.From late on Sunday, only New Zealand citizens from nine African countries will be allowed entry, and they will be required to spend two weeks in a quarantine hotel run by the military.Mr Hipkins said officials are confident the iant has not entered New Zealand and they are well placed to keep it out.Many countries have slapped restrictions on ious southern African countries over the past couple of days, including Brazil, Canada, the European Union, Iran, and the US, in response to warnings over the transmissibility of the new iant.This goes against the advice of the World Health Organisation, which has warned against any overreaction before the iant has been thoroughly studied.Most

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaGallery: Pudsey Bear Children in Need event held at Derrys Ardnahee School  College overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia National NewsWATCH: Donegal based father who murdered his we is jailed for a minimum of  years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaGallery: Pudsey Bear Children in Need event held at Derrys Ardnahee School  College overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia National NewsWATCH: Donegal based father who murdered his we is jailed for a minimum of  years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The event, hosted by members of the Bahai Community in County Derry, will be opened by Deputy Chair of Mid Ulster District Council, Christine McFlynn. Abdul Bahaacute was born Abbaacutes Effendi on May   in Tehran, Iran. He was exiled with his father by the Persian government in an attempt to stamp out the relatively new Bahai faith. Further banished to Constantinople and Edirne, his family was incarcerated in Akkaacute, a penal colony of the Ottoman Empire next to Haa in present-day Israel, in , and Abdul would remain there for  years. Known for his kindness and charity, he was released from prison in  and travelled to mainland Europe on boats manufactured by Harland and Wolf, before travelling across North America for eight months. During this time he became known as the Angel of Peace, participating in networks that shaped international peace movements. He had tickets for the Titanics maiden voyage in , but opted to sell them and give the money to charity, and his subsequent survival prompted him to double his efforts for peace and a global society. After war broke out in Europe, Bahaacute had already ed to Haa, where he had prepared for the worst, purchasing land in Galilee to grow wheat. Whena blockade threatened the region with starvation, Abdu’l-Bahaacute fed northern Palestine: rich and poor, Muslims, Jews and Christians — a humanitarian act for which He accepted a knighthood from King George V. He died on November  . Wednesday nights event is ticketed due to restrictions on space, but some spaces may be available on the night.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaGallery: Pudsey Bear Children in Need event held at Derrys Ardnahee School  College overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia National NewsWATCH: Donegal based father who murdered his we is jailed for a minimum of  years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.    More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaGallery: Pudsey Bear Children in Need event held at Derrys Ardnahee School  College overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia National NewsWATCH: Donegal based father who murdered his we is jailed for a minimum of  years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Mr Martin says the Government will have to keep its options open on further restrictions, explaining: NPHET have put in a caveat also that further measures can not be ruled out...can be very honest about that. His warning has been echoed by Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly, who said that it is impossible to saythere could be a lockdown in the future. Minister Donnelly added that whilea lockdown cannot be ruled out, it is not where we are currently as a nation. Other measures that are due to be introduced by the govt include: People will be told to work from home, under recommendation from NPHETVaccine passes will be required to access theatres and cinemas but not at hairdressers, barbers or gymsStrict rules around mask wearing for indoor and outdoor settings.  In addition to the new rules, two other measures aimed at reducing transmission of the virus were also revealed.

However, with confidence ing as vaccination rates rise, and economies gradually open back up, people are on the hunt again. He commented, “Recruitment is becoming an employee’s market, and the volume of roles available gives workers more options, allowing them to select the business with the best offering. Furthermore, after  months of working from their own homes, many people don’t want to go back to the office full-time.” Some % of respondents to a survey of around , Irish employees by the University of Limerick’s Kemmy Business School said they agreed or strongly agreed that ‘my future career lies outside of this organisation’. This was regardless of whether they worked in multinationals, indigenous Irish companies, SMEs or the public sector. The survey found that % of managers, % of site leaders, % of regional leaders and % of global leaders based in Ireland also feel their future lies outside of their current organisation. Mr Kindlon said businesses that fail to prioritise employee wellbeing, professional development and company culture could see employees leave in their droves in search of an employer that better meets their needs – and struggle to recruit new talent to the business. “It’s crucial that businesses focus on becoming an employer of choice in order to sustain operations and accelerate growth as economies recover from the disruption of the pandemic.” While competitive pay and generous perks are key to employee satisfaction and retention, he said flexibility and the ability to make a meaningful contribution to the job is just as important. “Multiple studies have shown that, more than ever, traditional office-based workers want a better work-le balance. That means flexible, remote or hybrid working to allow them to manage their professional and personal responsibilities in a way that benefits both their wellbeing and productivity.” “It means offering tangible, valuable employee benefits that put employee wellbeing at the forefront – so less of the ping pong tables, more of the competitive pension contributions and annual leave allowances. And it means nurturing a more positive company culture, in which the right to disconnect is respected – and so are employees.” He said the true impact of the great resignation remains to be seen, but employers who take the possibility of mass resignations and stled recruitment lightly will surely bear the brunt of this once-in-a-generation phenomenon as we move into . “Losing employees can be very costly. If multiple employees leave within a short time frame, depending on your company size you could be hit with huge costs as well as stled growth while you backfill positions.” There are a number of ways that companies can retain and engage current employees. These include offering a competitive mix of employee benefits with tangible value – such as enhanced pension payments, health insurance, above-statutory annual leave allowances, and flexible working to support employees’ work-le balance and wellbeing. Offering routes for career progression, either through promotion opportunities or by enabling employees to move to a dferent area of the business where desired and appropriate are also options. Mr Kindlon said the great resignation is both a threat and an opportunity for businesses in a wide range of industries. “While some businesses could see employees leave due to a number of contributing factors, employers with a competitive offering could see an increase in the talent available to bring into their teams.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaGallery: Pudsey Bear Children in Need event held at Derrys Ardnahee School  College overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia National NewsWATCH: Donegal based father who murdered his we is jailed for a minimum of  years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Cole joined Derry City in , and went on to make  appearances for the club. He played in last week’s - win over Dundalk, but was restricted to just  appearances overall this season. “Darren has been a fantastic servant to the club over the past five years,” Ruaidhri Higgins said. “He was very unlucky to pick up that injury in  which kept him out of the side. To his credit however he has worked his way back to full fitness and finished the season very strongly for us.” Walsh joined the club at the start of the season, but injury problems plagued him throughout his time at the club, as he made just  appearances. He did score a vital last gasp equaliser against Bohemians at the Brandywell in June but made just two more appearances after that. “Marc was very unlucky at times too, but Derry fans did get a chance to see how good he was just before the end of the season,” Higgins explained. “I want to thank both players for all their hard work since I came into the club and wish them the very best for the future.” The manager also confirmed that coach Cretaro has left for personal reasons. “I can confirm as well that first team coach Raff Cretaro is also leaving,” Higgins added. “Raff came in with me in April and has been a real influence around the club. He has a great way about him and is hugely popular with both the players and the staff.” “He does however have family commitments and I understand that. I know he has really enjoyed his time at Derry City and we would also like to wish Raff every success going forward.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaGallery: Pudsey Bear Children in Need event held at Derrys Ardnahee School  College overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia National NewsWATCH: Donegal based father who murdered his we is jailed for a minimum of  years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Cole joined Derry City in , and went on to make  appearances for the club. He played in last week’s - win over Dundalk, but was restricted to just  appearances overall this season. “Darren has been a fantastic servant to the club over the past five years,” Ruaidhri Higgins said. “He was very unlucky to pick up that injury in  which kept him out of the side. To his credit however he has worked his way back to full fitness and finished the season very strongly for us.” Walsh joined the club at the start of the season, but injury problems plagued him throughout his time at the club, as he made just  appearances. He did score a vital last gasp equaliser against Bohemians at the Brandywell in June but made just two more appearances after that. “Marc was very unlucky at times too, but Derry fans did get a chance to see how good he was just before the end of the season,” Higgins explained. “I want to thank both players for all their hard work since I came into the club and wish them the very best for the future.” The manager also confirmed that coach Cretaro has left for personal reasons. “I can confirm as well that first team coach Raff Cretaro is also leaving,” Higgins added. “Raff came in with me in April and has been a real influence around the club. He has a great way about him and is hugely popular with both the players and the staff.” “He does however have family commitments and I understand that. I know he has really enjoyed his time at Derry City and we would also like to wish Raff every success going forward.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaGallery: Pudsey Bear Children in Need event held at Derrys Ardnahee School  College overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia National NewsWATCH: Donegal based father who murdered his we is jailed for a minimum of  years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

It’s a fairly cringeworthy experience watching so many people pretend to like each other and dance and act like they’re not in it for the next round. The reason I get so worked up about it is that I was watching musicians for years and years, before the Arts Council handed out cheques, just making great music. Some of them still do. Jeanette Hutton still does. I’ll end up sounding like a lick but it’s a small price to pay to get across her importance to music here. The easiest way to explain her is that she’s the real thing. An incredible vocalist that you’ve undoubtedly heardyou were ever out on a Saturday night in Derry. A gted songwriter that has changed yet again for her third record. An irreplaceable friend and all-round cool girl with the best taste in music you’re going to find. A genuinely fine human being.She once told me that hearing Let There Be Rock by AC DC on Tommy Vance’s rock show inspired her to pursue music and to join Philby, who toured with Mama’s Boys and played with Rory Gallagher. Philby gained a local following which got bigger and bigger and that eventually meant they could buy a transit van and move to London . But the dficulties of constant touring around a circuit that covered a lot of distance around England with little to no pay to, even worse, pay-to-play gigs caught up with them and the band parted ways. Not that this was a bad experience and the band had gained enough acclaim to get write ups in Kerrang magazine and gigs in the famous Marquee venue in London . After a year out back home, Jeanette got involved in a local jam session with Frankie Robinson and Mickey the Hat and that has developed into her becoming one of the most recognised and respected musicians in the town. This led to her band Lady J’S first album with husband Ruairi O’Doherty, bassist David Doherty and guitarist Marty McGill and produced the self-titled album and some of the best gigs the parish has seen. Like I said earlier, this lady, J, has the best taste in music you’ve ever heard, and she took an absolute swerve in her next project with her sister Noella. Blood, the album and the live experience was all things to all music fans, loud and acoustic, heavy, and sweet, lyrical, and melodic set against loud guitars, quiet guitars and familial vocal harmonies that can only be captured by relatives. The perfect storm and another chapter in the book of big Hutton. Now we’re at the next chapter, the one where it’s just Jeanette. “Melancholy Me” is described a collection of dark, reflective, and weighty tunes that showcases her as a more introspective writer with brooding stories to tell. I’ve always found her music to be like that, the delivery is ever changing in a way that a great musician seems to be able to do that without taking a wrinkle out of them but the over-arching substance that fills her songs is a constant. There are a lot of musician and listeners out there who have a lot to learn from Lady J Hutton. Keep up to date with all happenings Hutton on her Facebook page, Jeanette Hutton Music. She’ll also be supporting Damien Dempsey in the Millennium Forum on Saturday th January and tickets can be got for that herewww.millenniumforum shows damien-dempsey . Remember something, the best music is right on your doorstep, it isn’t on Facebook, it doesn’t matter about likes on social medial or Spoty numbers, you can’t listen to music on computer, and it will never feel as good as seeing a band live and you can do just thatyou follow this yellow brick roadhttps:nervecentre.ticketsolve shows . You’ll see me at Jeanette’s gig on Sunday in the Nerve Centre, where I should point out her Blood co-conspirator and actual blood relative, sister Noella Hutton will also be playing and feel free to ask why I ended this like the Sopranos mid-  Magee on Music: Bloody Sunday . . .  years on  Special programme of events to mark th anniversary    Magee on Music: Still The Happiest Man in the World  Kevin Magee chats with local artist John Breslin    Magee on Music: New hope withof Stendhal Festival  Music festival at Stendhal -

It is popular amongst children and adults and generates festive cheer in every Irish household bringing a sprinkle of magic across the country. Each year there are guest appearances from many people ranging from celebrities to local heroes and family members of the participating children, youre sure to see a familiar face or two! Heres a round-up of the greatest guest appearances in Toy Show history  Girls Aloud  Toby appeared on the Late Late Toy Show in  and was surprised by mega girl-band Girls Aloud when he was performing their song on a Karaoke machine. Little Toby was stunned to see the pop group in person.   Ed Sheeran -  The greatest duet in ! Aimee Keogh was speaking about her love for music when showing Ryan Tubridy a Karaoke Machine, and included Ed Sheeran in her list of favourite artists. Ryan Tubridy and Aimee began to duet Lego House by Ed Sheeran, when she was surprised by the man himself. Starstruck and surprised by his appearance, she began to sing with Ed Sheeran on the Karoke Machine. Mr. Sheeran surprised her with tickets to his concert in London that year.  Danny from the Script  A group of three children sang Superheroes by the Script on the Late Late Toy Show in  as they were big fans of The Script. The band were surprised by lead singer Danny who thought their performance was amazing and said they would give The Script a run for their money. Mr. ODonoghue invited the boys to perform at their soundcheck in Croke Park that year. X Robbie Keane  Domhnall appeared on the Late Late Toy Show in  and spoke about his hero Robbie Keane and listed out several facts about the soccer star. It was evident Mr. Keane was his role model as he had a vast knowledge about him, his career, and his recent injury that year. Domhnall was overwhelmed when Robbie Keane surprised him on set and he was allowed to ask questions about his career.  Evelyn Cusack  Johnny charmed viewers when he spoke about his passion for the weather and his admiration for Evelyn Cusack who presents the weather on RTE One. He told Ryan he plays a game called Whos it going to be for the weather forecast and always hopes it is Evelyn, he also invented a board game called Aimsir. Evelyn Cusack surprised him on set, and Johnny was thrilled to see her.  Dermot Kennedy  Michael Moloney performed a Dermot Kennedy song on the Toy Show last year and was surprised by Dermot Kennedy mid-song during his performance. Michael was very professional and continued singing despite the shock and surprise sketched on his face. It was a truly heartwarming moment that uplted the viewers as we battled our second lockdown last year.  Davy Fitz: One of the most iconic moments in Toy Show history, Michael won the hearts of the nation when he appeared on the Toy Show. He revealed his favourite GAA manager was Davy Fitz and joked that he did not think they would get along as he was from six-mile bridge. Dvy Fitz walked out and surprised Michael, who was bewildered by his appearance. He asked Mr. Fitz to sign his book as he had brought it along with him . Davy invited Michael to speak to the Wexford team before their league matches.  While many celebrities drop by to say hello to Ryan and the children, family members also make an appearance. These are sure to warm your heart, and no doubt tonight will add to the list. Nanny Pat  Tom stole the show in  when he was surprised by his Nanny Pat on set of the Toy Show. He previously said he liked to knit with his Nanny Pat and she gave the best hugs. The two embraced with a warm hug and smiles all around. A very heartwarming moment in .  Graham Burke  Adam and Kayla Burke from Midleton, Co Cork were reunited with their dad Sergeant Graham Burke in a heartwarming reunion. Adam and Kayla unwrapped a giant present where their Dad was hiding, both children had tears of joy when he emerged. Graham ed from Mali where he has been completing his th tour of duty peacekeeping overseas.  John Doyle the Porter  Ireland was introduced to the lovely Adam King last year, and the nation was besotted with him. During his segment on the Toy Show, Adams favourite hospital porter surprised him on set and Adam gave him a virtual hug. John said Adam brings the best out of everyone he meets and he had the brightest smile.  Alex from Austraila  Lee and his family were surprised by their big sister Alex who came home from Australia for Christmas. Alex was not supposed to come home for Christmas, but Ryan and co. brought her home for Christmas to surprise the entire family. It was an emotional reunion as Lee had not seen his sister in three years and embraced her in a big hug.  Many more memorable appearances have occurred throughout the history of the Late Late Toy Show, and tonight will be no dferent. The list continues to grow with every show, and itreally is the most wonderful time of the year.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Members of the Glen football team bringing the John McLaughlin Cup to Francis Lagans St Marys PS Glenview just three weeks ago.Local NewsTributes paid following the death of much-loved County Derry principal overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsMotorist lucky to walk away after tree falls on car in Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday,  November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsPart of main Derry to Strabane road closed due to serious road traffic collision overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Raffaele Cretaro has left Derry City.SportThree depart the Brandywell at the end of a busy week at Derry City overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Eamonn on set with the stars of Derry Girls.Derry NewsDream role for Derry boy in new Derry Girls series overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaGallery: Pudsey Bear Children in Need event held at Derrys Ardnahee School  College overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia National NewsWATCH: Donegal based father who murdered his we is jailed for a minimum of  years overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Ice Wharf  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

An Innocent Man: Saturday, Talking Pictures TV @ pm Jimmies living a grand le in Calornia. Mike and Danny are two crooked cops not averse to robbing and framing suspects. One day they all collide and lives are shattered. A gritty and vicious thriller from  that didnt strike a chord with TV audiences used to Sellecks friendly Magnum persona but its a film thats really worth reevaluation. Selleck, David Rasche, Laila Robins, Bjada Djola and F. Murray Abraham add to a heady mix. Zombieland: Saturday, Syfy @ pm Americas been overthrown by the undead and a young man from Columbus, Ohio just wants to get home. On his danger fraught journey he meets another survivor from Tallahassee, Florida and both decide to stick together. This is a joy, from its Metallica scored opening scene to its fairground set climax its pure and utter fun. Jesse Eisenberg,Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin are all game for a laugh here. Parasite: Saturday, Channel  @ pm The Kims are living a miserable existence in a basement apartment in Seoul. The Parks live a comfortable le in a beautul home overlooking the city. The youngest Kim goes to work for the Parks and things are never the same again. Parasite is amazing. A e into Korean society that manages to be hilarious, nervewracking, terrying and exhilarating all at once. A totally deserved best picture winner.Song Kang-ho, Jang Hye-jin and Cho Yeo-jeong are just perfect in their parts. I Went Down: Sunday, RTEacute One @ .am  Two criminals travel into the wilds of rural Ireland to carry out a kidnapping at the behest of a man who owns them both. Things dont work out exactly as planned. For my money one the the best Irish comedies ever made. Brendan Gleeson is on fire as Bunny Kelly and Peter McDonald is good craic in his film debut. As always with Irish films the laughs come with a healthy dose of pathos and the two blend brilliantly. Apocalypse Now: Sunday, BBC Two @ .am  Captain Willard has been tasked with going up the NugravengRiver to terminate a rogue American Colonel with extreme prejudice. What he sees on his journey with stay with him and you forever. A nightmarish, drug fueled masterpiece and a harrowing, troubling, darkly comic  psychotic look into the troubling heart of man. If you havent seen it yet Im very jealous. Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Larry Fishburne, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest and Dennis Hopper will all blow you away. The Day Of The Locust: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .am The film where Donald Sutherland plays Homer Simpson. Yup. The s were a bad time in America and people flooded into Hollywood to find fame and fortune away from the Great depression. It worked out for some and not for others. A vicious and biting satire of the film industry. Flamboyant and extravagant in places, downright horrying in others. Its fantastic though and packed full of too many famous faces to list. Gone Baby Gone: Monday, Great! Movies @ pm A young girl goes missing in South Boston and a pair of investigators are hired to find her. A tough ask made tougher by red tape and the web of crime surrounding every aspect of the case. Ben Afflecks adaption of Dennis Lehanes book is a powerful and upsetting watch that will make you ask yourself questions you might not like the answers to. Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Amy Ryan and Ed Harris all do affecting work. Alfie: Monday, TCM @ pm Alfies a self centred ass, he loves himself, loves to hear himself talk. Women love him too but he treats them like dirt, taking what he wants from them before throwing them aside. Then one day le decides to slap him in the face. Controversial on release and highly influential in the years since this  drama is an excellent look at the light and dark of the swinging s. Michael Caine, Shelley Winters and Julia Foster all nail their parts. Transsiberian: Monday, Great! Movies Action @ .pm A couple are travelling home from China and take the train to Moscow. Along the way they meet another couple. Things get......well youll just have to see for yourself. A finely crafted and atmospheric watch from the Hitchcockian school of thrillers. Its rather violent and one scene may have you reaching for the remote but stick with it, its worth your time. Woody Harrelson, Emily Mortimer, Kate Mara and Ben Kingsley do good work The Man From Colorado: Tuesday, Film @ .pm Owen Devereauxs been appointed the federal judge of a region in Colorado but hes not exactly suited to the job. He has psychopathic tendencies that have, in the past during the civil war, been covered up by his friend Del, a man not willing to do it anymore. From  comes an uncommonly deep and thoughtful western that isnt afraid to shy away from big themes. For once Glenn Ford plays a villainous part and he does it well. William Holden and James Millican excel in supporting roles. The Man Who Knew Too Much: Wednesday, Film @ .pm An American family take an impulsive trip to Morocco and finds themselves in the midst of an assassination attempt and their lives are immediately in danger. It sounds heavy but this is one of Alfred Hitchcocks lighter and more enjoyable films. James Stewart and Doris Day lead the film and are delightful as their roles as always. A highly enjoyable and suspenseful film worth recording for a rainy afternoon. Deep Blue Sea: Wednesday, TCM @ pm In an attempt to find a cure for Alzheimers disease a scientist grows mega sharks so she can experiment on their brains. These sharks are kept in a secret facility but guess what  They are really brainy and really hungry. Renny Harlins sci actioner from  is gloriously stupid but its loads and loads of fun too. Blood spills and jokes fly as a wicked cast that includes Thomas Jane, Aida Turturro, Saffron Burrows and Samuel L. Jackson struggle to stay in one piece. The Conversation: Thursday, BBC @ pm Harrys a surveillance expert and hes got a new job. But the work is getting to him and his paranoia is at an all time high due to past events. Francis Ford Coppolas  thriller is a stunner. A post Watergate classic seeped in the pervading atmosphere of a broken country. Gene Hackmans spectacular as a man coming apart at the seams and the late John Cazale as his partner is as always magnicent. A nerve shredding watch. The Blood On Satans Claw: Friday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm A rural village in th century England is thrown into upheaval when an evil looking skull is unearthed by a plough and sinister things start happening in the aftermath. A prime example of folk horror, a subgenre from the early s that would still give you the chills nearly  years later. Its hefty stuff, that in places will offend but its genuinely effective. Patrick Wymark, Linda Hayden and Barry Andrews all do strong work. Damsel: Friday, TG @ .pm A man travels across the American Frontier of the th century on a little horse called Butterscotch. Hes looking for the love of his le so he can propose and the only thing between him and happiness is danger. A lot of danger. A slowburn pace might annoy some but this left-field take on the western genre is an entertaining and twisting watch propelled by nice turns from Robert Pattinson and Mia Wasikowska. Lapsis: Friday, Film @ .pm Rays taken a strange new job to help support his ailing brother. Hes marching into the woods, dragging miles of cable behind him to connect up cubes used for futuristic trading. To say more would be a ruin a unique and humorous satirical look at the exploitative techniques modern day employment is made up of. Its not always successful but its last  minutes really hits the spot. Dean Imperial as Ray is one to keep an eye out for.

An Innocent Man: Saturday, Talking Pictures TV @ pm Jimmies living a grand le in Calornia. Mike and Danny are two crooked cops not averse to robbing and framing suspects. One day they all collide and lives are shattered. A gritty and vicious thriller from  that didnt strike a chord with TV audiences used to Sellecks friendly Magnum persona but its a film thats really worth reevaluation. Selleck, David Rasche, Laila Robins, Bjada Djola and F. Murray Abraham add to a heady mix. Zombieland: Saturday, Syfy @ pm Americas been overthrown by the undead and a young man from Columbus, Ohio just wants to get home. On his danger fraught journey he meets another survivor from Tallahassee, Florida and both decide to stick together. This is a joy, from its Metallica scored opening scene to its fairground set climax its pure and utter fun. Jesse Eisenberg,Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin are all game for a laugh here. Parasite: Saturday, Channel  @ pm The Kims are living a miserable existence in a basement apartment in Seoul. The Parks live a comfortable le in a beautul home overlooking the city. The youngest Kim goes to work for the Parks and things are never the same again. Parasite is amazing. A e into Korean society that manages to be hilarious, nervewracking, terrying and exhilarating all at once. A totally deserved best picture winner.Song Kang-ho, Jang Hye-jin and Cho Yeo-jeong are just perfect in their parts. I Went Down: Sunday, RTEacute One @ .am  Two criminals travel into the wilds of rural Ireland to carry out a kidnapping at the behest of a man who owns them both. Things dont work out exactly as planned. For my money one the the best Irish comedies ever made. Brendan Gleeson is on fire as Bunny Kelly and Peter McDonald is good craic in his film debut. As always with Irish films the laughs come with a healthy dose of pathos and the two blend brilliantly. Apocalypse Now: Sunday, BBC Two @ .am  Captain Willard has been tasked with going up the NugravengRiver to terminate a rogue American Colonel with extreme prejudice. What he sees on his journey with stay with him and you forever. A nightmarish, drug fueled masterpiece and a harrowing, troubling, darkly comic  psychotic look into the troubling heart of man. If you havent seen it yet Im very jealous. Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Larry Fishburne, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest and Dennis Hopper will all blow you away. The Day Of The Locust: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .am The film where Donald Sutherland plays Homer Simpson. Yup. The s were a bad time in America and people flooded into Hollywood to find fame and fortune away from the Great depression. It worked out for some and not for others. A vicious and biting satire of the film industry. Flamboyant and extravagant in places, downright horrying in others. Its fantastic though and packed full of too many famous faces to list. Gone Baby Gone: Monday, Great! Movies @ pm A young girl goes missing in South Boston and a pair of investigators are hired to find her. A tough ask made tougher by red tape and the web of crime surrounding every aspect of the case. Ben Afflecks adaption of Dennis Lehanes book is a powerful and upsetting watch that will make you ask yourself questions you might not like the answers to. Casey Affleck, Michelle Monaghan, Amy Ryan and Ed Harris all do affecting work. Alfie: Monday, TCM @ pm Alfies a self centred ass, he loves himself, loves to hear himself talk. Women love him too but he treats them like dirt, taking what he wants from them before throwing them aside. Then one day le decides to slap him in the face. Controversial on release and highly influential in the years since this  drama is an excellent look at the light and dark of the swinging s. Michael Caine, Shelley Winters and Julia Foster all nail their parts. Transsiberian: Monday, Great! Movies Action @ .pm A couple are travelling home from China and take the train to Moscow. Along the way they meet another couple. Things get......well youll just have to see for yourself. A finely crafted and atmospheric watch from the Hitchcockian school of thrillers. Its rather violent and one scene may have you reaching for the remote but stick with it, its worth your time. Woody Harrelson, Emily Mortimer, Kate Mara and Ben Kingsley do good work The Man From Colorado: Tuesday, Film @ .pm Owen Devereauxs been appointed the federal judge of a region in Colorado but hes not exactly suited to the job. He has psychopathic tendencies that have, in the past during the civil war, been covered up by his friend Del, a man not willing to do it anymore. From  comes an uncommonly deep and thoughtful western that isnt afraid to shy away from big themes. For once Glenn Ford plays a villainous part and he does it well. William Holden and James Millican excel in supporting roles. The Man Who Knew Too Much: Wednesday, Film @ .pm An American family take an impulsive trip to Morocco and finds themselves in the midst of an assassination attempt and their lives are immediately in danger. It sounds heavy but this is one of Alfred Hitchcocks lighter and more enjoyable films. James Stewart and Doris Day lead the film and are delightful as their roles as always. A highly enjoyable and suspenseful film worth recording for a rainy afternoon. Deep Blue Sea: Wednesday, TCM @ pm In an attempt to find a cure for Alzheimers disease a scientist grows mega sharks so she can experiment on their brains. These sharks are kept in a secret facility but guess what  They are really brainy and really hungry. Renny Harlins sci actioner from  is gloriously stupid but its loads and loads of fun too. Blood spills and jokes fly as a wicked cast that includes Thomas Jane, Aida Turturro, Saffron Burrows and Samuel L. Jackson struggle to stay in one piece. The Conversation: Thursday, BBC @ pm Harrys a surveillance expert and hes got a new job. But the work is getting to him and his paranoia is at an all time high due to past events. Francis Ford Coppolas  thriller is a stunner. A post Watergate classic seeped in the pervading atmosphere of a broken country. Gene Hackmans spectacular as a man coming apart at the seams and the late John Cazale as his partner is as always magnicent. A nerve shredding watch. The Blood On Satans Claw: Friday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm A rural village in th century England is thrown into upheaval when an evil looking skull is unearthed by a plough and sinister things start happening in the aftermath. A prime example of folk horror, a subgenre from the early s that would still give you the chills nearly  years later. Its hefty stuff, that in places will offend but its genuinely effective. Patrick Wymark, Linda Hayden and Barry Andrews all do strong work. Damsel: Friday, TG @ .pm A man travels across the American Frontier of the th century on a little horse called Butterscotch. Hes looking for the love of his le so he can propose and the only thing between him and happiness is danger. A lot of danger. A slowburn pace might annoy some but this left-field take on the western genre is an entertaining and twisting watch propelled by nice turns from Robert Pattinson and Mia Wasikowska. Lapsis: Friday, Film @ .pm Rays taken a strange new job to help support his ailing brother. Hes marching into the woods, dragging miles of cable behind him to connect up cubes used for futuristic trading. To say more would be a ruin a unique and humorous satirical look at the exploitative techniques modern day employment is made up of. Its not always successful but its last  minutes really hits the spot. Dean Imperial as Ray is one to keep an eye out for.

However, the scoreboard remained the same as heroic UCC defence and a lack of accuracy at crucial times undid all the hard work.A forward pass undid one multi-phase attack and a penalty given away in an attacking position from an otherwise excellent line-out maul foiled another.Then a superb scrummaging effort won the home side a penalty on the UCC five-metre line. Ballynahinch looked to turn the screw and opted for another scrum, only to give away a penalty and come away from another stint in the UCC  with nothing.As the opportunities came and went UCC continued to defend well and kick superbly and when Squires got them out of trouble with a brilliantly executed - kick to give them a foothold in Ballynahinch territory they were visibly lted and reasserted themselves in attack.They were able to close out the game, despite missing a penalty in front of the posts and having another kick and chase try disallowed for a knock-on, leaving Ballynahinch reflecting on how they failed to turn all their possession and territory statistics into points.The league table, which is the only statistic that counts at the end of the season, shows Ballynahinch at the bottom, having been defeated by their nearest rivals in their last two outings.There is no respite as Munster giants Cork Constitution roll into Ballymacarn Park this weekend on the back of three consecutive wins, having shrugged off their uncharacteristically slow start to the season.Ballynahinch : John Dickson, Zack McCall, Kyle McCall, James Simpson, John Donnan, Thomas Donnan, Oli Loughead, Bradley Luney, Chris Gibson, Jack Milligan, Aaron Cairns, Rory Butler, Tagen Strydom, Shane Ball, Yasser Omar, Josh Hanlon, Nacho Cladera Crespo, Diego Vidal Souza, Callum Irvine, Conor McCauley, Greg Hutley..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/24Novemeber2021_StreetBoost.jpg","title":"Business boost for high street  ","story":"BUSINESSES across the district are being given a unique opportunity to help shape the future of high streets across the Newry, Mourne and Down area.Members of a Stormont task force spearheading a new initiative will be in Downpatrick next week for a workshop designed to provide local people with their say on how to rejuvenate town centres in a post-Covid world.Junior ministers Gary Middleton and Declan Kearney mdash who are leading the task force mdash will be at Denvirrsquos Coaching Inn on Thursday,December , and are encouraging business owners and residents to come along and have their say during what is being billed as an evidence gathering exercise.A number of local councillors have echoed their appeal for people to take part in the two-hour event which starts at pm.Designed to help make town, city and village centres places where people can do business, socialise, shop, be creative and use public services, the task force is determined to make a dference, with its membership including a raft of government departments and key organisations including Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster.The junior ministers say while there are many common and shared challenges, they recognise that every high street is dferent and has its own character, personality and needs that will each require bespoke local solutions.They want to hear views and evidence from far and wide, across both urban and rural areas and are urging e everyone with an interest in the future of their local high street to respond to the call for evidence and share their views.The task forcersquos visit to Downpatrick comes after it was revealed that there are currently  empty shop units in the town centre.In addition, the finishing touches are being put to a pound, revitalisation scheme in Church Street, while work is continuing to redevelop the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty, adjacent buildings as part of a major retail and commercial development opportunity which, it is hoped, can attract a number of leading retailers.Ahead of the Downpatrick consultation event, the business community and wider civic society is being asked to put forward ideas on what success in high streets could look like, with the focus on family friendly destinations where people want to shop, socialise, live and work.The task force said the series of workshops provide important opportunities for everyone to have their say and make their views known, with the junior ministers particularly keen to hear from a wide spectrum of people.Mr Kearney added: ldquoOur high streets are for everyone.

This was due mostly to a long, very arduous hill along the back straight but there were also some very tricky tight turns which were treacherous.There was a long downhill which some used as recovery but others saw this as a chance to gain places and they threw caution to the wind, flinging themselves down the descent in an alarming fashion.The spectators had plenty to watch and saw the runners several times per lap.Mackenzie Murray found it hard to get himself into the groove in the U-  race and despite coming second overall, he felt that his performance was under par.Looking back at how well he ran in Ballyclare recently, it is hard to argue with this self assessment.

The southern team was trying to reach the world cup finals while the Ulstermen wanted to give their manager, Billy Bingham, a fitting send offThe southern team was trying to reach the finals of the tournament in the United States, while the Ulstermen wanted to give their legendary manager, Billy Bingham, a fitting send off as he retired from international football.I was there and the atmosphere was competitive, on and off the pitch. When Northern Ireland’s striker, Jimmy Quinn, sent a volley arcing past Pat Bonner’s outstretched glove in the second half, Windsor Park erupted with joy.The theme song that night, ‘There’s only one team in Ireland,’ had already been firmly established.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The chant had been heard first in Dublin, when the Republic’s fans taunted northerners during a - win. That mockery hurt, because Northern Ireland was traditionally the dominant force in Irish football, qualying for international tournaments while the south struggled. Now that Northern Ireland had taken the lead against Jack Charlton’s side the song was redeployed. The stands at Windsor Park shook with noise, as the Green and White Army reminded their rivals that theirs was the original Irish football team veterans of three World Cups and reigning Home Nations champions.Billy Bingham, the Northern Ireland manager, was retiring from international footballUnfortunately, minutes later, the Republic equalised and secured their place in the US. I still maintain that goal came from a free-kick that should not have been given. Nigel Worthington shoulder-charged Eddie McGoldrick perfectly fairly, but the referee decided otherwise.These are the decisive moments that haunt fans, but they are part of the game and the Republic was deservedly destined for New York. The saddest thing was that Bingham did not get the winning end that his career deserved. However, his team had restored a lot of pride with its battling performance. Of course, Northern Ireland was a troubled place in November . The build up to the match was overshadowed by horric terrorist attacks like the Shankill bombing and the Greysteel massacre. Northern Ireland fans at the November  game at Windsor Park. The build up to the match was overshadowed by horric terrorist massacres yet the atmosphere was not unusually hostile or sinisterDespite this deeply unpromising context, the atmosphere was not unusually hostile or sinister. I was only a teenager, but I had already seen more vitriol at club games and I would do so many more times in the years to come. That’s why I was delighted to read Mark Rainey’s two page spread, in Wednesday’sNews Letter , about the myth that Windsor Park was a cockpit of hatred that night. He explained in detail how the hood got started. The Republic’s manager, Jack Charlton, believed that Northern Ireland should have gone easy on his team. Famously, after the final whistle, he said, “Theybattled too hard... They will get no favours from us... ever.”This typically graceless comment set in train a series of inventions, distortions and exaggerations that were repeated asthey were gospel by generations of players, fans and commentators.As Mark noted rightly, none of these accusations were levelled at the home fans in the immediate aftermath of the match.Many of the modern preconceptions about Northern Ireland fans’ conduct seem to have arisen from the Marie Jones’ play, A Night in November. Soon these details were cited by pundits who were nowhere near Windsor Park, but who nevertheless portrayed it as a bastion of bigotry.The contrast between what I saw that evening and the hysteria that followed made a strong impression on me, even as a schoolboy. It showed me vividly thata myth was repeated often enough in Northern Ireland it became accepted as fact, not just by its nationalist inventors, but by neutrals and well-meaning unionists too. Even Northern Ireland’s advocates now tell a story about how fans transforming their behaviour after this supposed “night of hate”. This narrative highlights the way the atmosphere at Windsor Park changed over many decades, becoming more inclusive and family friendly, but it repeats a caricature that was never fair or real.Football fans have rarely behaved perfectly. They are passionate, get carried away and sometimes act aggressively and badly. No doubt, some Republic fans found the atmosphere at Windsor Park in  unpleasant or uncomfortable. They were not, it must be said, supposed to be in the stadium in the first place.The myth of the “night in November” has been perpetuated for so long that it is now unlikely ever to be dispelled. Thank goodness that a journalist has the courage to challenge it and explain its origins. It will mean a lot to very many people.

Latest news bulletins are reporting ever increasing numbers of confirmed cases of Covid- in the last few days causing hospitals and intensive care units to be overwhelmed, indeed to breaking point. Millions, many of them children, remain unvaccinated in impoverished countries, and at huge risk to infection, serious illness, and death.

That is also the message of today’s gospel narrative. Even in the midst of the world’s confusion and chaos, Jesus reassures us: “The Kingdom of God is near”. As dficult as it may sometimes be to discern its presence. Our Lord faced turbulent times as well – born of parents forced to seek shelter for the night in a cow shed – not exactly the palace of a prince or king. Yet, the surprise of Christ’s incarnation forces us to look again in our own age at the “signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars”, and to consider anew the signs of God’s involvement in the world about us.Advent is the season when we learn to overcome our “fear and foreboding” and once more open our hearts to others just as God has disclosed and demonstrated his love for us in Christ.Advent also reminds us that our spiritual winter will come to an end. The fig tree will again blossom and bloom. “Summer is near,” our Lord reassures us – even at the beginning of Advent. “Our redemption is drawing near.”Amid all the dficulties of this le, when uncertainty and fear loom near, may we ever look to Jesus, and put all our faith and trust in Him, mindful that His word and promise to His people “will not pass away”.Let us remember His timely warning: “Be on your guard”. We must always recall that, as the Gospel reminds us, our Lord will come like a thief in the night, and at a time when we least expect him. As we enter the Advent season, may we be vigilant, awake, and always on our guard for Christ’s ‘Second Coming’.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
