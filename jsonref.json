But although targeted relief for the unemployed should unquestionably be a priority, it is not clear that $2,000 cheques for all would in fact help to sustain the US economic recovery.One post-pandemic scenario is a vigorous demand-driven recovery as people gorge on restaurant meals and other pleasures they’ve missed for the past year. Many Americans have ample funds to finance a splurge. Personal savings rates soared following the disbursement of $1,200 cheques last spring. Many recipients now expect to save their recent $600 relief payments, either because they have been spared the worst of the recession or because spending opportunities remain locked down.So, when it’s safe to go out again, the spending floodgates will open, supercharging the recovery. The Fed has already promised to “look through” – that is, to disregard – any temporary inflation resulting from this euphoria.But we shouldn’t dismiss the possibility of an alternative scenario in which consumers instead display continued restraint, causing last year’s high savings rates to persist. Prior to the Covid-19 crisis, some two-thirds of US households lacked the savings to replace six weeks of take-home pay. Having reminded Americans of the precariousness of their world, the pandemic is precisely the type of searing experience that induces fundamental changes in behaviour.We know that living through a large economic shock, especially in young adulthood, can have an enduring impact on people’s beliefs, including those about the prevalence of future shocks. Such changes in outlook are consistent with psychological research showing that people rely on “availability heuristics” – intellectual shortcuts based on recalled experience – when assessing the likelihood of an event. For those parents unable to put food on the table during the pandemic, the experience will establish a heuristic that will be hard to forget.Moreover, neurological research shows that economic stress, including from large shocks, increases anabolic steroid hormone levels in the blood, which renders iniduals more risk-averse. Neuroscientists have also documented that traumatic stress can cause permanent synaptic changes in the brain that further shape attitudes and behaviour, in this case plausibly in the direction of greater risk aversion.Though the pandemic is in some ways more akin to a natural disaster than an economic shock, natural disasters also can affect saving patterns: savings rates tend to be higher in countries with a greater incidence of earthquakes and hurricanes.This behavioural response is largest in developing countries, where weak construction standards amplify the impact of such disasters. One study of Indonesia, for example, found large increases in both the perceived risk of a future disaster and risk-averse behaviour among people who had recently experienced an earthquake or flood. While the response to natural disasters may be more moderate in advanced economies – where iniduals expect that their government will compensate them – some lasting impact will almost certainly remain.The upshot is that we can’t count on a burst of US consumer spending to fuel the recovery once the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines is complete. And if private spending remains subdued, continued support from public spending will be necessary to sustain the recovery.But putting $2,000 cheques in people’s bank accounts won’t solve this problem because unspent money doesn’t stimulate demand. With interest rates already near zero, the availability of additional funding won’t even encourage investment. Sending out $2,000 cheques to everyone thus would be the fiscal equivalent of pushing on a string.Fortunately, there is an alternative: the president-elect Joe Biden’s $2tn infrastructure plan would mean additional jobs and spending, which is what the post-pandemic economy really needs. Better still, under the prevailing low interest rates, this option would stimulate job creation without crowding out private investment.Obviously, the “well targeted” part is important. President Donald Trump was right that the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act was loaded with pork, not least his own “three-martini lunch” tax deduction for businesses. There’s every reason to question whether Congress can do better when crafting an infrastructure bill.In response to this problem, countries such as New Zealand have established independent commissions to design and monitor infrastructure spending initiatives. If Covid-19 changes everything, then maybe it can change the way the US government organises infrastructure spending. Creating an independent infrastructure commission with real powers would go a long way toward reassuring the sceptics and insuring the recovery against the risks posed by the pandemic’s lingering behavioural effects."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c516f4eed0f63ca35f795998eea193245a7cb83/0_0_6048_3628/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=faad2d282ba07dc22faec93d86ecd3f3","title":"uk economy gdp november lockdown recession economists ftse pound business live","story":"Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news, as UK GDP falls for the first time in six monthsDespite this slowdown, US retail sales are still higher than a year ago - lifted by a surge in online spending during the pandemic.Ben Casselman of the New York Times tweets:Just in: US retail sales were much weaker than expected in December, in another signal that America’s economy is suffering from the Covid-19 pandemic.That follows a sharp jump in new unemployment claims yesterday, and shows why the US economy desperately needs a new stimulus programme - and to get to grips with the virus raging across the country.Kwasi Kwarteng, Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, has also hailed the Supreme Court ruling on business interruption insurance - calling it a ‘lifeline’ for tens of thousands of small firms:But Samantha Holland, head of insurance at law firm Gowling WLG, warns that policyholders might face further legal battles to force their insurers to pay out:The FCA test case, coined as “probably the most important insurance decision of the last decade”, reached a culmination today as the Supreme Court handed down its judgment. This case has served to be a lengthy and significant battle, directly affecting 370,000 policyholders with wider implications for 700 types of polices across over 60 insurers.Representing a landmark victory for many small businesses across the country, the Supreme Court found in favour of the FCA and the Hiscox Action Group and ultimately removed many of the hindrances that policyholders might have faced when claiming for cover.In particular, the wider approach to the wording of prevention of access and hybrid clauses and the positive ruling on causation, that it is sufficient for a policyholder to show that at the time of any relevant Government measure there was at least one case of COVID-19 within the specified radius, will be good news for many policyholders, unlocking millions of pounds worth of claims for business interruption losses as a result of COVID-19.Nevertheless, the judgment is not without its caveats and policyholders are therefore encouraged to carefully consider the small print of their own insurance policies in light of the judgment. Many are still likely to face months of uncertainty, and possibly their own legal battle, before their claims are actually paid.Here’s Mel Stride MP, Chair of the Treasury Committee, on the Supreme Court’s ruling on business interruption insurance:“This ruling will be welcomed by many businesses who are struggling through the pandemic it may provide a lifeline for many of them.As the Treasury Committee has been urging, it’s right that the FCA will now ensure that valid claims are paid by insurers as quickly as possible.”Getting back to UK GDP... the NIESR thinktank predict the economy will slow sharply over the last quarter of 2020, and then contract in the first quarter of 2021.They also point out that the negative short term economic cost of lockdowns is outweighed by the long-term health and economic benefits of combating Covid-19.The Supreme Court ruling is a “comprehensive and resounding victory for policyholders”, says legal firm Mishcon de Reya, who represents the Hiscox Action Group (businesses seeking insurance payouts for disruption in the pandemic)Richard Leedham, partner at Mishcon de Reya, explains:“We are glad that the Supreme Court has found that the vast majority of policyholders of non-property damage Business Interruption (BI) cover will have cover for their business interruption losses caused by the national response of the Government to COVID-19. This includes most of the members of the Hiscox Action Group, whom we represented in the case, and RSA and now all QBE policyholders whom we represented at first instance through my partner Sonia Campbell and Hospitality Insurance Group Action. The Supreme Court has recognised that, just when this cover was needed most by thousands of UK businesses, insurers were wrong to argue that coverage was applicable only if there were narrow local restrictions, that they could deny claims because the cover had not been intended to be provided and or because the interruption and therefore losses would have happened in any event.The judgment should be a massive boost to all businesses reeling from a third lockdown who can now demand their claims are paid. In a detailed analysis of insurance law on proximate cause and causation, the Supreme Court has clearly and efficiently torpedoed the academic and convoluted arguments of insurers and laid down clear guidance as to how these claims should be paid. Insurance group Hiscox (one of the insurers in today’s case) says:The Judgment handed down today comprises more than 100 pages of legal analysis by the Supreme Court addressing important points of insurance law and setting new precedent for over 50 insurers and almost 400,000 policyholders.The Supreme Court largely confirms the outcome of the High Court’s ruling that, except in rare circumstances, cover is restricted to Hiscox policyholders who were mandatorily closed.Fewer than one third of Hiscox’s 34,000 UK Business Interruption policies may respond as a result. Hiscox has also increased its estimate for business interruption payouts in 2020 by $48m, following today’s court ruling and recent government restrictions.Tens of thousands of small businesses that were forced to close during the Covid-19 pandemic are now set to receive payouts on insurance claims following what was described as a “historic victory” at the supreme court, my colleague Rupert Jones writes.Judges threw out the appeals from six insurers and largely supported the arguments made by the Financial Conduct Authority and a policyholder action group.The FCA has previously estimated the value of claims affected at about £1.2bn, though some analysts have said several billion pounds could be at stake.The Hiscox Action Group said insurers should be “in no doubt that they should immediately start doing the right thing and settle these claims”.And here’s the BBC’s take:Tens of thousands of small businesses will receive insurance payouts covering losses from the first national lockdown, following a court ruling.The Supreme Court found in favour of small firms receiving payments from business interruption insurance policies.For some businesses it could provide a lifeline, allowing them to trade beyond the coronavirus crisis.The ruling could cost the insurance sector hundreds of millions of pounds.The Federation of Small Businesses is also celebrating the Supreme Court’s ruling in favour of policyholders in the landmark Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) business interruption insurance test case.FSB chair Mike Cherry says businesses who are covered by disease or denial of access clauses in their insurance policies should receive payments quickly.“Today’s judgement is a big victory. It cements the high court’s decision to grant businesses left on the brink the insurance pay-outs they are rightfully owed. For many, it has been a long and difficult road to get to this stage so this will bring clarity and hope to the thousands of firms which have been left in financial limbo for almost a year.“While this is good news, and while the law has to follow procedure, it’s disappointing that so many small businesses have had to wait to get the money they desperately need under policies they believed were there to protect them, policies they bought in good faith.“Businesses deserve to be protected in a timely way, but instead they have been failed by their insurers and are now trying to make up for lost time. Providers must now pay-out quickly, and consider the steps they can take to progress these claims in a swift and seamless manner. Any paperwork required of claimants shouldn’t be onerous or time-consuming. “Small businesses contribute trillions to the economy. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was right to argue that disease or denial of access clauses within interruption policies should trigger pay-outs in the event of coronavirus-linked disruption. We are hugely grateful for its work in this space.”UK business groups are welcoming the Supreme Court ruling that thousands of businesses should be covered by their insurance for losses caused by coronavirus lockdowns.Michael Kill, CEO of the Night Time Industries Association, says:“This is a moral victory for thousands of businesses with Hiscox Business Interruption Insurance, that have been placed under unnecessary financial hardship because of the legal process that has been drawn out much longer than was necessary by Insurers”“We are extremely pleased that the Supreme Court has dismissed the insurers appeal claims and supported the rights of thousands of businesses to be able to claim against their BI Insurance”“We still have some detail to interpret on many of the other policies that have been reviewed by the Supreme Court, and will update throughout the day on the results”.“I would like to thank the FCA for there support throughout this process and the legal guidance of Philip Kolvin QC through a very dark period for many businesses”“It is now very important that insurers do the right thing and expedite the payment process”Kate Nicholls of UK Hospitality says it’s ‘critical’ that payments are made quickly.The FCA has said the Supreme Court has “substantially allowed” its appeal against the insurance industry on behalf of policyholders hurt by the pandemic. Sheldon Mills, the FCA’s executive director for Consumers and Competition, says payouts should be made quickly:‘Coronavirus is causing substantial loss and distress to businesses and many are under immense financial strain to stay afloat. This test case involved complex legal issues. Our aim throughout this test case has been to get clarity for as wide a range of parties as possible, as quickly as possible, and today’s judgment decisively removes many of the roadblocks to claims by policyholders.‘We will be working with insurers to ensure that they now move quickly to pay claims that the judgment says should be paid, making interim payments wherever possible. Insurers should also communicate directly and quickly with policyholders who have made claims affected by the judgment to explain next steps.‘As we have recognised from the start of this case, tens of thousands of small firms and potentially hundreds of thousands of jobs are relying on this. We are grateful to the Supreme Court for delivering the judgment quickly. The speed with which it was reached reflects well on all parties.’In a boost for firms hurt by the pandemic, The UK Supreme Court has ruled that thousands of businesses should be insured for losses amassed after the national lockdown.The ruling settles a test case that pitched the markets regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, against major insurers. The insurers had argued that business interruption policies did not cover widespread disruption caused by the shutdown last year. The case centred on whether clauses related to infectious or notifiable diseases were triggered by the pandemic, and whether the closure of premises triggered the ‘prevention of access’ clauses.Bloomberg has more details:Insurers lost a last-ditch attempt to dodge payouts to thousands of small businesses that were forced to close during lockdown, as the U.K.’s top court ruled in favor of policyholders in a dispute over Covid-19 claims.The U.K. Supreme Court ruled Friday that policies sold by six firms including RSA Insurance Group Plc and Hiscox Ltd. cover losses sustained when businesses were shut down to help slow the spread of the outbreak. The firms had appealed a lower-court decision in September that found some policies in a test case brought by the U.K.’s top markets regulator should pay out.European stock markets have dipped this morning.In recent weeks, markets have been boosted by the prospect of a new US stimulus package - so Joe Biden’s announcement last night of $1.9bn for health support, vaccinations, and relief for families may already be priced in.Derek Halpenny of Japanese bank MUFG reckons the plan could be trimmed back by the Senate .That is down to the fact that passing legislation under ‘reconciliation’ does have its limits and aspects of the fiscal plan that have no Republican support could end up being removed.The process of ‘reconciliation’ is complicated by what’s known as the “Byrd Rule” offers a way for Senators to object, with the Senate presiding officer then taking the advice of the non-partisan Senate parliamentarian to decide on the outcome. So the Democrats do not have carte-blanche in pushing this bill through.There are plenty of aspects that could be passed under reconciliation but even those could get watered down given Biden has made much of his desire of reaching compromise and trying to end the partisan isions in Congress. Neil Wilson of Markets points out that there’s still uncertainty over some issues:A little bit of buy the rumour, sell the fact about equity indices as they tread lower in the wake of president-elect Joe Biden’s $1.9tn stimulus package. Like a good Roman emperor it’s got something for everyone – lots of bread, lots of circuses. The sticking plaster will suffice for now and we’ll see what the infrastructure package looks like in due course.Other questions remain about the new administration’s longer-term ambitions – how much for green spending? How much more tax and regulation on banks, shale drillers andor big tech? Will he soften trade relations with China? Will Yellen at Treasury embark on full MMT? Here’s our economics editor Larry Elliott on today’s GDP figures:Why was the drop smaller than expected? For a start, more of the economy remained open in November than it did during the first lockdown. Factories kept turning out goods, construction work was allowed, children continued to go to school.In addition, a couple of one-off factors supported activity. One was that the knife-edge state of trade negotiations between the UK and the EU encouraged firms to stockpile as insurance against a no-deal outcome. A second was that there was a delay between England’s lockdown being announced and the restrictions coming into force, which allowed people to do some early Christmas shopping or have a meal out.But as Paul Dales, the UK economist at Capital Economics has noted, the UK has built up some immunity to lockdowns. Firms have found ways of doing business despite the restrictions, such as providing click-and-collect services. Consumers don’t stop spending when the shops are shut: they simply shop online.Paul Dales of Capital Economics has an encouraging take - he thinks the UK will avoid a double-dip recession, given the November slump wasn’t as bad as feared.But the growing immunity of the economy to lockdowns is encouraging, means that vaccines may allow it to get back to its pre-crisis peak earlier than most had assumed and supports our view that the Bank of England won’t need to resort to negative interest rates. Why wasn’t November’s contraction wasn’t as severe as March and April, during the first lockdown? Jonathan Athow, the UK’s deputy national statistician, has written an interesting thread on this issue. The good news is that companies were better prepared this time - with retailers boosting their online sales, and more pubs and restaurants offering takeaways and click-and-collect.The bad news is that some sectors are still so depressed that they simply don’t have as far to fall this time.Here’s my colleague Richard Partington on today’s GDP report:The UK economy is heading for a double-dip recession after official figures confirmed a renewed slump in November as the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic took hold.Confirming the first step towards a double-dip recession, the latest official figures end six consecutive months of growth over the summer, when the UK economy had been recovering from the first wave of the crisis.After the decline in November, analysts forecast GDP will probably fall in the final quarter of 2020 and a further decline in the first three months of 2021 amid tougher lockdown restrictions at the start of the year would put the UK back in recession.The Covid-19 pandemic has now caused the three largest falls in monthly UK GDP since records began in January 1997, the ONS says: “The sharp GDP fall in November as England entered its second national lockdown suggests that the UK is in the midst of a double dip recession as it starts the year with even stricter restrictions.“But while the economic story today is of only the second-ever double dip recession on record, the story of the year will be a vaccine-driven bounce back in economic activity for sectors like hospitality and leisure.“The Chancellor must do everything he can to support that recovery once public health restrictions ease.”Professor Costas Milas of the University of Liverpool has plotted this graph which shows how economic activity has weakened as the stringency of the Covid-19 restrictions has risen:Looking forward, the economic picture remains bleak, at least in the short run. In response to additional anti-contagion measures (most notably the third lockdown in January 2021), Google mobility developments, which serve as a proxy for consumer expenditure suggest a further drop in economic activity for 2021Q1:In fact, the latest Google mobility data (up to January 2021) suggest the UK economy will perform much worse in 2021Q1 compared to the last quarter of 2020."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33b26f9d21631930168c7014edad1e35a81372e4/0_226_3491_2096/master/3491.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=7d83e0ceef529f8305f772862698a318","title":"wine bargains to cheer us all up","story":"What with one thing and another, a dry January seems masochistic – particularly when there are bargains on the wine shelves Still, there is one light on the horizon that’s not always reported in the usual doom-laden headlines: if you’re a fan of new world wines, there shouldn’t be any major hiccups in wine prices going forward, although if the pound is weak, prices will creep up inexorably. “Cost-conscious British customers may end up drinking more wine from Argentina, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, instead of their favourites from France, Italy or Spain,” says Oleg Dmitriev of Italian wine specialists Independent Wine. “For most new world wines, the prices won’t change, because countries will sign ‘continuation agreements’ with the UK, repeating the same tariffs we had through the EU. But European wines may become more expensive under new import rules, so producers of inexpensive French Languedoc wines or Italian chianti may see part of their shelf space taken by Antipodean cabernets and sauvignon blancs.”Considering we’re still Australia’s number one market, that’s good news both for them and for us, especially as the quality of Australian staples such as chardonnay, cabernet and shiraz have improved immeasurably in the past few years.Otherwise it’s, um, who knows?

If you find something you like at a good price, I’d lay some in just in case the government comes over all puritanical, cordons off the supermarket booze aisles and tells us we’re not allowed to buy alcohol after 6pm.Whatever stumbling blocks there are in the short term, there’s still a lot of wine in the country, so we’re not going to run out just yet.

Even in the seconds before Danny Ings had latched on to James Ward-Prowse’s cunning free-kick, the box-office sideshow to Southampton’s victory over Liverpool was well under way. Jürgen Klopp raged as Ralph Hasenhüttl flip-flopped from apoplectic to equable, willing his players on with the gusto of a marathon spectator, before the Southampton manager crashed to all fours wiping away tears of joy.That goal in itself is a microcosm of the strides Southampton have made under Hasenhüttl, a workaholic who spent last spring creating a digital ‘playbook’, a blueprint for players and staff to follow across the club. This season no team in the ision have scored more goals from set pieces, excluding penalties, and seven of their past nine goals have stemmed from set plays. The nine Southampton have managed means they are two away from equalling last season’s tally with more than half a season to play. The hours Ward-Prowse spends honing his craft by practising a dozen free-kicks every week should not be overlooked but nor should Hasenhüttl’s decision to narrow the brief of the former goalkeeper coach Dave Watson. Upon taking charge Hasenhüttl was unhappy Watson had to juggle roles and so for the past 18 months his focus has shifted to set pieces.“It is a luxury, if you want, but it gives you a lot of quality in offence but also in defence, at set pieces,” says Hasenhuttl. “It was not possible for Dave to do like he did before, goalkeeper coach and set-pieces coach. I decided to let him only do the work for set pieces because it is a massive challenge every week, especially now with so many games to prepare for. He is very good, very concentrated and the way he teaches it on the pitch is very good, enthusiastic, and this is the reason why we have scored a lot of goals so far and also still, touch wood, very good defending at set pieces.”Hasenhüttl’s high-octane style is engrained in his squad. Ibrahima Diallo, an £11m recruit from Brest who made his first start on Boxing Day, was exceptional against Liverpool and Kyle Walker-Peters has been a standout performer since joining permanently from Tottenham. In the last calendar year only Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United won more Premier League games. This season, a team that spent much of the last campaign hovering above the relegation zone are seventh, 17 points above the dotted line. After ditching the self-destructive high line that allowed Son Heung-min to feast on the grassland behind the Southampton defence at St Mary’s in September, they have proven stubborn opposition, keeping a joint-high eight league clean sheets.Saturday brings a trip to fourth-placed and free-scoring Leicester. Southampton are likely to be without Danny Ings after the striker tested positive for Covid-19 and, although a modest squad will be stretched, his absence provides further opportunity. In many ways, it will be the perfect test for a club happy to lean on youth. Nathan Redmond, Moussa Djenepo and Nathan Tella are injured but the 21-year-old Daniel N’Lundulu impressed off the bench against Liverpool, when the 18-year-old midfielder Kgagelo Chauke became the latest youngster included in the matchday party. Shane Long, who recently compared the belief in the squad to the Ronald Koeman era, when Southampton twice qualified for Europe, is a sound alternative.One of the academy’s main objectives is for half of the first-team matchday squad to be made up of players with roots at the club. Against Liverpool there were 11 academy graduates, including Theo Walcott, who has looked comfortable up front or wide since returning to where it all started, and Jack Stephens, who joined from Plymouth aged 17. In September Southampton’s Under-23s morphed into a ‘B’ team, a decision led by Hasenhüttl and the director of football, Matt Crocker, to align youngsters closer to the first team so that when an opportunity arises, they are versed in the Austrian’s thinking."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa1eb79afb59fd75a685f413a48bbd8872bdf012/0_236_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5506871055b7b4e6c9a9deb6a069c1c7","title":"liverpool v manchester united buildup transfer news and more live","story":"And now here’s Jurgen Klopp saying he has ‘no skills for playing mind games’.The angle here is Klopp pointing out that since the start of last season United have been awarded 20 penalties, twice as many as Liverpool over the same period. Since Klopp took over in October 2015, United head the spot-kick count 67-46. Former ref Mark Clattenburg has said recently that Klopp is trying to influence officials by bringing the discrepancy up but Jurgen isn’t having it:When people like Mr Clattenburg speak now it says much more about them than it does about me. I have no skills for playing mind games, that is my problem.Am I surprised someone is talking about what I have said? Clattenburg? No. It’s nice we can talk about him. I am not Sir Alex for different reasons.A Liverpool v Man Utd game wouldn’t be complete without some cod psychology so here’s an early dose of “mind games”.Here’s what our very own Jamie Jackson has picked up...Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has made the unusual statement for a Manchester United manager that it will be an “upset” if the record 20-times champions beat Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday. He is, though, being a little cute as the Norwegian also said United believe they can win anywhere.Every team goes into every game thinking they’re going to win it and we know we can beat anyone anywhere on any given day. It’s a test and reality check of where we’re at. Won many, many tight games, scored goals in injury time, but not really set the world alight too many times and to win at Anfield you need to be at your best level. If you listened to this week’s Football Weekly Extra podcast, you may have heard Jacqui Oatley mention her favourite resource for Premier League injury news.Yes, it’s the does-what-it-says-on-the-tin premierinjuries.As of right this very second, the club with the most reason to gripe is Brighton. They have 11 players out or doubtful.Manchester United team news? Here’s Ole Gunnar Solskjær with the latest update for Sunday’s trip to Anfield.I’m going to give everyone a chance, another day. Anthony (Martial) is not out of it.I think the only ones that are certainly out are Brandon (Williams) and Phil Jones. They’re the two that definitely cannot make the game.A couple of others maybe doubts, but we’re hoping, fingers crossed. Some Liverpool team news for the big one against Manchester United on Sunday. Jurgen Klopp says it’s a ‘no’ for Naby and a ‘just wait and see’ for Joel.Joel is close. Does it make sense now to throw him in with just one or two sessions he didn’t do yet?We have to see if he can train tomorrow with the team. I haven’t decided yet.Here’s the story from Ben Fisher on Wayne Rooney hanging up his boots to focus on being full-time Derby County boss.Newcastle boss Steve Bruce is under the cosh but he’s been getting a welcome dose of support from Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta, ahead of their clash on Monday. Of course, the Gunners manager has plenty of recent experience of being in the firing line himself. Here’s Arteta on the man he calls “Brucey”.To get through a difficult period? First, you need support from the club and then you need to feel as well that your fans can see what you are trying to build. The most important part is the feeling you have with the players. When you feel that the players are on board and they are really trying for you, that they are behind you, that gives you a big energy. Probably when you feel that the players are lost and not behind you, that is difficult.I absolutely feel for Brucey. When you are sitting in one of these chairs, you suffer and you have a lot of empathy for your colleagues. We all know what it takes, how much we suffer and as well Brucey is a top guy – a really good manager but a top guy, too. David Tindall here now. Thanks Gregg. Do we view Gregg’s brief stint as an enjoyable cameo or shrouded in the shame felt by a substitute being substituted? I think that happened to Juan Mata once. Anyway, Gregg has just done a big story on Wayne Rooney while home schooling little ‘uns so we doff our caps.Wayne Rooney has been appointed as Derby County’s manager on a two-and-half-year deal.  When I first arrived back in the United Kingdom I was completely blown away by the potential of Derby County Football Club. The Stadium, Training Ground, the quality of the playing staff and the young players coming through and of course the fan base that has remained loyal and supportive. Despite other offers I knew instinctively Derby County was the place for me. To be given the opportunity to follow the likes of Brian Clough, Jim Smith, Frank Lampard and Phillip Cocu is such an honour and I can promise everyone in involved in the club and all our fans, my staff and I will leave no stone unturned in achieving the potential I have witnessed over the last 12 months of this historic football club.Derby confirm that “Rooney has elected to call time on his illustrious playing career to fully focus on his job.” It’s not been a bad one. Five Premier League titles, one European Cup, one Europa League, one FA Cup, three League Cups and a Club World Cup.Afternoon, and thanks Tumaini. Klopp will be back at 4.10pm … at Newcastle. But he’s not been parachuted in to advise Steve Bruce. Nope. As Greg Wood flagged in Talking Horses, the five-year-old mare Klopp, ridden by Laura Pearson, runs in the Heed Your Hunch At Betway Handicap. Liverpool fans will be hoping for a good omen before the big one against Manchester United on Sunday. That’s all from me today. Thanks a lot for following and I leave you in the hands of Gregg Bakowski.“Winning a football game and winning against United is enough. There’s no extra add-on in the game because they are in the situation they are. They’ve got the points, they deserve the points they have so far, and we have ours. The season still has a long way to go so it’s not really in it that we talk now constantly about ‘if we win, we are ahead of them again”.“We don’t do that. We just try to win our football games and for this we need to perform at our highest level because United is good, they always were, and that’s it.”Jürgen Klopp is speaking ahead of Liverpool’s big game with Manchester United and had this to say about players hugging:It is a difficult one but we all know about the situation. The boys did so far an incredible job to be disciplined with all the things around the virus and pandemic. I know they will try to do their best. If there’s hopefully something to celebrate then it will bee in an appropriate way. But it is difficult. “As I said before, it is instinct but it is really difficult. When you run alone towards the goal and have the opportunity to score and the next situation you have to think about what you do then, it’s a proper, proper challenge. Football is an emotional game and all these things.”“What we should not forget in the discussion about this is that these players are tested two or three times a week. During the week, we reduce the contact to the minimum. These are the moments once, twice three times a week they have to concentrate mainly on the game. We will see and we will try like we always have. That is it.”From yesterday, an interview with Marcus Rashford’s old Headteacher by Maya Wolfe-Robinson:“As I said after the (9-0) game, this will always be part of our history, but the main interesting thing is how you write the history after this game and this is what makes me more proud to be honest,” the Southampton manager said.“It was a game you lose when a man down after 10 minutes, what everybody forgets afterwards, but it is okay.“This is part of our history, no problem, but afterwards I think of where we are now, which is the fact which makes me really proud.”Southampton would go level on points with Leicester if they can pull off a win.As English eyes focus on Sunday, the big game today is across Europe in Italy, where Roma will take on Lazio in the Rome derby.This has been a tough season so far for Lazio, who sit in 8th and 12 points from the top. The new year has seen a slight turn in their fortunes with consecutive wins against Fiorentina and Parma. Regardless, it will take a lot to beat a Roma team that sits in third place and has been impressive, spearheaded by a resurgent Henrikh Mkhitaryan. Most of all, it is the type of match-up that will make us all miss crowds:Aston Villa manager Dean Smith has been named Premier League Manager of the Month for December. Villa had three wins and two draws.Chelsea FC Women boss Emma Hayes said she tested positive Covid-19 in December (PA):“I was OK. I was fortunate, I was fine.“I’m grateful and I hope it doesn’t come and bite me in the backside at some other point.“I was fed up of running away from Covid to be honest, so when I did get it, I felt like ‘OK, it’s here now. I’ve go to do everything I can so that it hopefully doesn’t wipe me out, and it doesn’t affect my parents and everybody else’.“So I had an isolated Christmas, and that’s the least I could do to make sure nobody else got it.”Lovely stuff from Yaya Toure on his career and becoming a coach.“I wouldn’t say I was demanding as a player. I just saw the potential in my teammates and wanted them to be as comfortable as possible. That was something I learned at Barcelona: everyone is different. If you don’t talk with them and it’s only the manager giving information, you can’t make your teammate the best they can be. If they score a goal, it is a goal for all of you, so why not help them whenever you can?”West Brom manager Sam Allardyce ahead of their upcoming game against Wolves (via PA):“Derbies are about your passion and capabilities to play the game, and not the occasion.“If the occasion overwhelms you then you can’t get a performance. But if you can use the derby to stimulate you, then you will get opportunities.“We want to have the bragging rights and make our fans feel better on top of what we’re suffering at the minute, a little bit of joy during this period.“Another three points would make such a difference, not just against our local rivals but it would take us to 11 points - double figures. We want to break the barrier, let’s see if we can.”Auckland FC have pulled out of the Fifa Club World Cup, which appears to be going ahead during this pandemic. From the Fifa website:“Following the withdrawal of Auckland City, the Fifa Club World Cup 2020 will be contested by Al-Duhail SC, Al Ahly SC, FC Bayern Munich, Ulsan Hyundai FC, Tigres UANL and the winners of the Conmebol Libertadores final scheduled for 30 January.”Who was the last player to have such a transformative effect on a top team?Here is Jacob Steinberg’s full piece on Fikayo Tomori and Milan.Graham Potter on Brighton’s form and Marcelo Bielsa ahead of tomorrow’s game versus Leeds (via PA):“I think we’ve probably had one game, or a game-and-a-half (this season), where we’ve not been ourselves,” said Potter. “Other than that, our performance level has been good.“But if you don’t get the points there is criticism and pressure, and (people saying) you have to do something to get the wins. We know that. We are in a results business.“They get back in the Premier League - it wasn’t easy but they’ve done it and they’ve done it well - and now they are bringing their own game to the Premier League, which is a credit to him and everybody there.”Milan want to insert an option to buy Fikayo Tomori if they sign the Chelsea centre-back on loan this month. The Serie A leaders are looking to strengthen their defence this month and have opened talks over a deal for Tomori, who has fallen out of favour under Frank Lampard this season.Scott Parker had plenty of nice things to say about his former teammate Frank Lampard ahead of Fulham’s match against Chelsea tomorrow at 5:30pm.“(He had a) work ethic and a determination. (I have) massive respect for Frank as a footballer and the player he was,” Parker said.“I was privileged enough to play with him but I’ve probably got more respect for a guy that had an unbelievable work ethic.“He drove (himself) everyday in terms of his craft and wanting to get better and had a single-mindedness about him that got him the career he got.“With those foundations and those abilities, I always knew that if that was a thing he wanted to go into in terms of management then he’d be successful because with those values you’ve always got a chance.“So it doesn’t surprise me that he’s gone to Derby and does well and then gets the Chelsea job under tight restrictions last year in terms of what they had to go through and he did an incredible job with them. And the same this year really.”This is the fourth time he has won. He hasn’t even been in England for a full year. This is quite a stat:Marcelo Bielsa has defended Kiko Casilla, whose form has been under scrutiny recently. Last year, he was fined £60k and banned for eight matches after he was found to have racially abused Jonathan Leko of Charlton. (via PA)“I fully trust in Kiko and I will do the utmost possible to help him,” said Bielsa, whose side will bid to bounce back in the Premier League against Brighton at Elland Road on Saturday.“I think that the treatment he suffered ignores the fact that he played 40 games for Real Madrid.“Apart from whether his performances were good or bad, we forget all the things he has done to get the team promoted.”“People also don’t consider how he’s been treated publicly given the situation that he had to go through when he was suspended for eight games,” Bielsa said.“I believe in him, his team-mates believe in him and we are close to him because we value him as a person and a footballer.“We accept what people think of him in the media or people, but we know his past and we know his conditions and we care about him a lot as a human being.”Leeds face Brighton at 3pm on Saturday. Liverpool-United hasn’t yielded too many goals over the past 5 years. The head to head since January 2016: 3 wins for Liverpool, 2 wins for United and 6(!) draws. Of the 6 draws, half were 0-0 and the other half were 1-1.Please do take a look at Guti’s assist for Zidane’s second goal here. Delightful.Marcus Rashford gives Jose Mourinho credit for Manchester United’s many penalties.Manchester United’s Leah Galton to Louise Taylor: “Christen Press and Tobin Heath have changed minds and our mindset. They’ve brought a different, much more positive, mentality. They’ve given us belief and the confidence to keep pushing forward, to create and to take more chances. They’ve given me the confidence to shoot from outside the area.”Here are 10 things to look out for ahead of another Premier League weekend.Another postponement: Tomorrow’s scheduled Championship game between QPR and Wycombe Wanderers has been postponed after positive COVID-19 tests to some Wycombe playersstaff.Wycombe are supposed to face Tottenham in the FA Cup fourth round in 10 days.Paul Pogba has given a couple of interviews over the last few days. An indication of how well things are going for him over the last couple of weeks.Good morning! We are back for another Friday countdown as a packed Premier League weekend awaits. The biggest fixture of the weekend is very clear. Manchester United and Liverpool will reprise their rivalry in the top two spots on the table for the first time in a while when they face each other on Sunday, with the victor finishing the weekend top.Aside from that, play will begin tomorrow around midday with a West Midlands derby between Wolves and West Brom, then West Ham vs Burnley, Leeds vs Brighton and a London derby between Fulham and Chelsea. Saturday will conclude with Leicester City vs Southampton. Sunday will see Sheffield United vs Tottenham, Liverpool vs Manchester United, Manchester City vs Crystal Palace and finally Arsenal vs Newcastle. Aston Villa vs Everton has been postponed due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak at Villa.

Ministers announced this week that they would be distributed to all 317 local authorities in England.However, experts have repeatedly raised concerns about the accuracy of the devices made by Innova.The tests are specifically designed for use on people with Covid-19 symptoms and are most effective at identifying those with high viral loads, who are the most infectious. They are supposed to be administered only by trained professionals.The quick turnaround time means the tests can find positive cases that would not otherwise have come to light. However, many experts are concerned that people who test negative will presume they are safe to get involved in activities with others, or visit vulnerable and elderly people, with some saying this week that they may cause serious harm.The MHRA is understood to have expressed similar concerns to officials in Matt Hancock’s Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) on Tuesday, a week after the rollout began in secondary schools.Sources said the regulator made clear that it had not given the green light to the daily use of these tests on pupils who would otherwise have to self-isolate.Prof Jon Deeks, a biostatistician of the University of Birmingham and Royal Statistical Society, described the use of rapid tests in this context as “ridiculous and dangerous” and welcomed the MHRA’s stance.He said: “It is really important that we have confidence in the safety and effectiveness of tests for Covid-19 and all other diseases - this is the responsibility of our regulator.“This clarification of the unsuitability of lateral flow tests for saying people are not infected with SARS-CoV-2 from the MHRA demonstrates that they are taking their responsibility seriously to ensure that tests are used in a safe way.“The government needs to take greater care in ensuring they evaluate the potential harms as well as the benefit of all their mass testing proposals.”The decision is a another setback for the prime minister’s mass-testing plan and raises questions about the proposed full return of schools after the February half-term, which is partly dependent on the availability of serial testing.The government could apply for an exceptional use authorisation from the MHRA but this would take time and it is far from clear that it would be approved.Any further distribution of the daily tests may also be on the condition that people are warned more explicitly about the risks, instead of a negative result being presented as a “green light” that they are Covid-free.Williamson stressed the importance of repeat testing when he appeared before MPs on the Commons education select committee on Wednesday. He also said parents of primary school children would be expected to carry out the tests on their child at home – a suggestion likely to raise alarm bells at the MHRA, which has not approved self-administered tests in this way.Williamson said: “Testing is a really important part of bringing people back into school. It’s an important part of fighting Covid-19 right across the community.“If we’re testing a child, in essence we’re in a position where we’re also testing a household as well. We’re extending staff testing as of next week to primary schools and I would like to see it rolled out to all pupils, that’s my ambition – that’s where I want us to get to.”A spokesperson for the DHSC said: “Lateral flow devices are a vital tool to finding more asymptomatic cases and the government’s approach to testing in schools will reduce transmission.“We are testing teachers and students weekly on site to find positive cases and break the chains of transmission. In addition, as part of an ongoing evaluation, we are doing daily contact testing in schools using an assisted testing model. “The evidence and lessons from these and other evaluations will be used to inform our review of the effect of daily contact testing on breaking chains of transmission and any future plans.” The MHRA has also been approached for comment but had not responded by the time of publication."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/587a70b8a0b9e3bfde110934fa837ed71ad31eb7/0_172_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=b49e6b681402f30221603f0891b7d343","title":"if the news gets you down why not try the olds instead","story":"The biggest tree in Amsterdam is now a toy for the elephants in the zoo.

Video: RTÉ\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThere have been 2,488 Covid-related deaths in the pandemic so farPublic health officials are looking at reducing the length of time the contact of a Covid-19 case has to restrict movement, but only when case numbers fall significantly.Under a change being made now, the testing rules for healthcare workers who are close contacts are to be eased, with the introduction of a second test 10 days after exposure, in addition to a first test after five days. Staff will not have to restrict their movements if the second test is negative, rather than having to wait 14 days.Assistant chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said a similar change may be applied to contacts in the general population if case numbers were to drop significantly.A further 28 deaths of Covid-19 patients were reported by the National Public Health Emergency Team yesterday. This brings to 2,488 the total number of deaths in the pandemic.A total of 26 of these deaths occurred in January, while the dates of two deaths remain under investigation.Nphet also reported 3,955 new confirmed cases of the disease, bringing to 163,057 the total number of cases in the Republic.Of the new cases, 1,210 are in Dublin, 456 in Cork, 235 in Louth, 221 in Meath and 218 in Limerick, with the remaining 1,615 cases spread across all other counties.InfectsThe reproduction number, a measure of how many other people a case infects, now stands at 1-1.3, according to Prof Philip Nolan, chairman of the Nphet epidemiological modelling advisory group.He said that from an epidemiological perspective, the current wave was different to what had been seen since spring, “and perhaps worse”.“The penetration of the virus throughout all ages of the population is a particular cause for serious concern, as is risk of severe disease that all of these people face. Poor health outcomes, risk of serious or long-term illness and hospitalisation remain a risk for us all when it comes to Covid-19. That is why we must follow public health advice and protect not only ourselves but our hospital system and healthcare workers by staying at home.Of the 208 deaths so far this month, 23 were linked to outbreaks in hospitals and 38 to outbreaks in nursing homes. Those who died ranged in age from 25 to 98. Of the 132 people who died on January 6th-12th, 92 per cent were over 65, and the mean age was 79, officials said.ChallengedAccording to Prof Nolan, people have worked hard to reduce contacts and the impact of this was beginning to be felt in the figures. However, the hospital system would continue to be challenged over the coming weeks and there were also concerns about outbreaks in specific settings.Almost half of all cases reported during the entire pandemic occurred in the past fortnight, he pointed out. One in every 67 people have tested positive in this time.The incidence of the disease now is 20 times what it was in early December, while the number of deaths each day has risen from four to 23.The more transmissible variant first identified in the UK in December now accounts for 46 per cent of samples sequenced by Irish labs, officials told a Nphet briefing yesterday.Dr Cillian De Gascun, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, said it was not unusual for viruses to mutate over time, and two of the three recently identified variants from the UK and South Africa were in Ireland.“While some of the new variants will increase the risk of becoming infected because they have increased transmissibility – they can stick longer and better to surfaces – this does not mean that our continued adherence to the public health advice is in any way less effective.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4459257.1610720231!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"covid 19 vaccine hse extends interval between first and second jabs in move to vaccinate more people","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA pharmacist holding   a phial of the undiluted Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for Covid-19. Photograph: Jean-Francois MonierAFPGettyThe HSE is extending the interval between the first and second doses of the Covid-19 vaccine from 21 to 28 days in a move that will spread the benefit of the vaccine to more people.In a letter on Thursday, HSE management was told that the interval was being extended to 28 days for “anyone who has their first dose of this vaccine from Monday, January 18th, 2021.”The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the only Covid-19 vaccine being administered in the State, is about 52 per cent effective after the first dose, according to data published by Pfizer last month.The extension of the dose interval will mean that there will be more vaccine first doses available to be given to frontline healthcare workers in hospitals and to residents and staff in nursing homes who are all being inoculated in the early stages of the vaccination programme.Tánaiste Leo Varadkar on Friday said the only constraint on the speed of rolling out the vaccine is supply.“There are unfortunately two things that are not under our control. The first is when the vaccine gets apprived by the EU. Secondly, it is the rate which manufacturers can supply it.“I heard news today that Pfizer might be closing down its speed and that is something that is not under our control.”The HSE said that the National Immunisation Advisory Committee updated their advice on the dose interval for the vaccine in guidelines published on Wednesday. The guidelines show that the vaccine course consists of two doses between 21 and 28 days apart.“If the interval between doses is longer than 28 days, the second dose should still be given as soon as possible. The course does not need to be restarted,” the guidelines state.All long-term care facilities will be sent new information leaflets to allow them to inform residents and staff of the change and aftercare leaflets are being updated with the changes.“It is vitally important that all stocks of old information materials and aftercare leaflets are removed from circulation so that they cannot be used from 18th January,” says the HSE letter from senior manager David Walsh to management across the health service.“The vaccinator should confirm to the recipient at the time of vaccination that their second dose is due 28 days after the first dose. Schedules for second dose of vaccinations should be updated accordingly.”Nursing home management, staff and relatives of residents have been calling for an acceleration of the vaccination programme to 24 hours a day, seven days a week as the high level of virus in the community is leading to an increase in the number of outbreaks in care facilities.The HSE said this week there were 142 nursing home outbreaks and that it was monitoring 103 closely. Including all long-term care facilities, there are 279 open outbreaks.The number of new nursing home outbreaks more than doubled to 52 last week.Concerns have been expressed by nursing home managers and advocates for nursing home residents that the vaccine may not be administered in long-term care facilities that are battling outbreaks where there are 50 residents and more than 80 per cent have Covid.The vaccine cannot be given to anyone who has a Covid infection or who has had an infection, shown symptoms or tested positive in the previous four weeks.Protection from a first dose of the vaccine does not kick in until at least 12 days and the single does is significantly less protective than two. There is 95 per cent protection from two doses.The HSE said this week that more than 77,000 Covid-19 vaccines have been administered, including 69,378 vaccinations going to frontline healthcare staff.A further 47,600 vaccinations are planned for next week, of whom about 3,900 will be receiving their second vaccination under the previous 21-day interval.First doseAs of January 13th, 77,303 people had received the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, according to the Government’s Covid-19 data hub website, which states the page will be “regularly updated”.It emerged on Thursday that vaccine roll-out in nursing homes is being recorded with pen and paper as the IT system to deal with the inoculation programme is not in place. Independent TD Cathal Berry, who is also a medical doctor, told the Dáil that “in effect, we are combining 21st century cutting-edge vaccine medicine with a 13th century means of recording it, which is simply a pencil and paper”. Tánaiste Leo Varadkar acknowledged that vaccinating in nursing homes and in healthcare settings was “a pen and paper exercise at the moment”. He said an information technology (IT) system had been delivered to the HSE at the end of December. “We will very much need the IT system when we go out to the GPs and pharmacies. I am told that we will be ready for when it is required, which is, most likely, next month sometime.”At a briefing on Thursday afternoon, HSE Chief Executive Paul Reid said 69,378 of the vaccines were received by frontline healthcare workers and 7,925 were received by people in long-term care facilities.The Government expects that at least four million people in the State will be vaccinated against Covid-19 by the end of September.Updated projections sent by Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly to TDs on Wednesday night say that while 700,000 people will be vaccinated by the end of March, the State now expects to receive some 3.7 million doses between April and the end of June and a further 3.8 million between July and the end of September. This would mean that at least 4 million people could be vaccinated by that time.It is expected, however, that most adults will be vaccinated by the end of the summer once additional vaccines are approved by the European Medicines Agency in the coming weeks.Ireland began vaccinating its population at the end of December using the PfizerBioNTech vaccine.On Tuesday afternoon, the first delivery of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine arrived in the country . Ireland has pre-ordered 875,000 doses of the vaccine.On Twitter Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said the first delivery was a small one, but that “every vaccine counts”.The Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine entered the final phase of the approval process during the week, according to the European Medicines Agency.

File photograph: Niall CarsonPA Wire.More than 20,000 people have received alerts saying they have been in close contact with a confirmed coronavirus case through the Health Service Executive (HSE)’s Covid Tracker phone app since it was released in July.The app, which cost about €850,000 to develop and has an annual running cost of some €400,000, currently has more than 1.3 million active users, the HSE said. Some 20,298 people have received close contact alerts through the app, however, a HSE spokeswoman said the total was likely some 25 per cent higher as “some people do not enter a phone number or enable metrics”. Asked if many of those who received alerts later tested positive for Covid-19, she said this data was under review and not currently available.An issue arose in August with the app where users with Android phones experienced battery draining issues, which led a significant number of people to uninstall the app. The issue was resolved within days. Other issues relating to background processing that were reported in October, but later resolved by Apple, Google and in conjunction with the HSE team, she said.Asked if many people had deleted the app, the spokeswoman said: “App deletion and app abandonment should not be confused, people often delete and reinstall apps - not just Covid Tracker”.Since December 23rd, an estimated 94,804 people have installed the app, and 47,798 have uninstalled, the spokeswoman added.As a result of pressure on the testing and tracing system, the HSE is no longer testing close contacts of confirmed cases. However, this decision does not affect the way in which the app operates.“The app is serving it’s primary purpose close contacts are being notified via the app that they have been in contact with someone who has tested positive.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4458651.1610649544!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the social worker said were two seconds of pleasure worth it for all this","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStephanie Walsh was asked in 1971 if her family would offer a temporary home to a young pregnant girl. Photograph: Diarmuid GreeneLast week Stephanie Walsh wrote in The  about how she was asked in 1971 if her family would offer a temporary home to a young pregnant girl, as an alternative to the girl going to a mother and baby homes.“I had just given birth to our third child when the 17-year-old pregnant schoolgirl came to live with us, acting as an au pair. The girl and her parents wished for her pregnancy to be kept secret. This was the climate of the early 1970s.“This girl was part of our family until her baby was born,” she wrote. Later the young mother, following discussions with Walsh, her own parents and a social worker, decided to have the baby adopted.“At that time it seemed the best option for the baby and the mother. In the Ireland of the time, single pregnant girls had few choices.”She was not alone. Elaine O’Malley, then in her early 20s, and her husband, who live in Co Limerick, offered a home to five young women – some in their early 20s, one under 17 – between 1979 and 1983.Following an inspection by a social worker, “it went from there”, she says. No money was exchanged. The girls stayed for up to six months, had their own room and helped out around the house and with babysitting.“They were very much part of the house. They ate with us, watched television with us, were part of the family. I smoked at the time, so we smoked together, and went on days out on Sundays, and on weekends away.”The O’Malleys never asked the women their stories, but the women shared over time. One, who had recently lost her father, did not want to hurt her bereaved mother by telling her she was pregnant. One told her family that she had got a job elsewhere.“The youngest was still at school. Another had a boyfriend who visited. “We knew these girls were going through hell,” she says. Once a girl ran away. When she came back, the social worker came to see her.O’Malley was in the room with the two of them for the meeting. “I can still remember what the social worker said to the girl. She said, ‘Was it really worth it? Was two seconds of pleasure worth it for all this?’ ”AdoptionThe O’Malleys drove the women to the maternity hospital, where their social worker met them. “I visited every day after that.” It was understood that the babies would be given up for adoption, but the women did have six months to change their minds.O’Malley was present for the handing over of one baby. “The girl and the baby and a nun went into a room, and then the girl came out without her baby.” O’Malley had lost a baby to infant mortality, so she understood profound grief.“The difference was, my baby died. I didn’t have to give him up,” she says. “I found watching that handover heartbreaking. Those girls were not giving up their babies by choice. There wasn’t another option open to them.”Afterwards, the girls stayed with the O’Malleys for a week or 10 days, to try and adjust. “We wanted them to stay longer, but after a week or so the social worker would come out and say, ‘It’s time to get back to your life now.’“We had been told from the beginning by the social worker that we’d never hear from these girls again once they left that we were part of a past they would want to forget,” she says. “We think of those girls who lived with us so often, especially this week.”The social workerBridget, who prefers not to be identified, was a social worker in the west of Ireland for 25 years from the late 1970s. She was one of two who worked full time with women facing crisis pregnancies: “My abiding memory of that work is grief,” she says.“That has stayed with me. I feel this inside in the marrow of my bones, because everyone I worked with had grief. People who couldn’t have a baby – I’m talking about adoptive applicants – they had terrible grief.“The women who placed babies for adoption I can’t even begin to describe the grief of that loss. And the adopted children not knowing who you are really is the biggest loss of all. Although who can say what is the biggest loss of all?“Mothers would have come to us in a state over their daughters being pregnant,” she says. “I don’t ever remember a father coming in: by that, I mean the father of the pregnant girl. I don’t ever remember a boyfriend of a girl coming.“It was always a woman, whether it was the girl by herself. Sometimes they didn’t tell their parents. Or sometimes it was a friend of the girl came with her a girlfriend. The men were absent.”Mostly they were in their 20s and 30s. Many of them worked full time and were terrified they would lose their jobs. No matter what age they were, she says, it was “very difficult for anyone to keep a baby unless they had support from home, and support from home wasn’t always there”.In all, her adoption agency dealt with 400 cases. Sometimes Bridget had to be the one to deliver the news of the pregnancy to a parent.“I remember one girl couldn’t face her mother. She just couldn’t tell her. So she asked me if I would tell her.“So I wrote to her mother and asked if she would meet me. And she did. I told her that her daughter was pregnant. And she said, ‘I would prefer if you had told me she had cancer.’ And those were the days when a cancer diagnosis more than likely meant death, in people’s heads.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Travel news latest: Uproar as Portugal is pulled into South America travel banJoe the Pigeon gets execution reprieve in Australia after it emerges US tag was fakeCoronavirus latest news: One type of Brazil variant detected in UK\u0026#39We are under siege\u0026#39: Bobi Wine claims military raiding home after he rejected early Uganda election results as riggedPhilippines\u0026#39 Duterte says women not fit to be president amid speculation his daughter could succeed himPolitics latest news: Scottish fishermen accuse Boris Johnson of having \u0026#39spun a line\u0026#39 over Brexit deal readers on post-Brexit rule changes to 48-hour week: \u0026#39This must never happen\u0026#39Comment: The Government will not be forgiven for repeating its tragic care home mistakeComment: If it wants to build back better, the Government needs to kickstart the Northern economyComment: Roman historians wouldn\u0026#39t bat an eyelid at the storming of the CapitolElectric cars will be allowed to use bus and cycle lanes in city trialComment: If Scottish Labour cannot get its act together then it deserves to dieBrazilian variant: what is the new Covid strain and should I be worried?Long-standing distrust of polio drops threatens Covid vaccine campaign in PakistanNorth Korea unveils \u0026#39world\u0026#39s strongest weapon\u0026#39 at military paradeIndonesia earthquake: Hospital flattened as deadly magnitude 6.2 tremor rocks Sulawesi islandExperts counter charity advice not to drink for two weeks after Covid jabWhat Donald Trump\u0026#39s impeachment means and his chances of a comebackBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"vaccine success brink oftransforming lockdown debate","story":"After almost a year of watching the seemingly unstoppable onslaught of Covid-19, the speed of progress now is hard to take in. Just a few months ago, Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer, was telling colleagues he didn’t believe a vaccine would come in time. Now we have several of them, highly effective, already delivered to millions worldwide. The logistics, the safety: it’s all going as well as can be expected – in Britain, especially. The big question is what happens next.Israel will be the first to give the world an answer. Benjamin Netanyahu, up for re-election in March, is now campaigning as the vaccine king after cutting a deal with Pfizer to make his country the “model state” of the Covid inoculation. He’s offering up vast amounts of anonymised health data, to help Pfizer learn more, and supplies have come rolling in.Israel, a country the size of Wales, will soon be vaccinating as many people a day as Italy, France and Germany put together. Already three-quarters of its over-60s (ie, those most likely to die from the virus) have been protected. The rest will be covered within days, not weeks.Israel won’t see a collapsing R-number or plummeting infections: not for a while, at least. The main vaccine effect should be a breakdown in the link between infections, hospitalisations and deaths. Protecting a small number of people should mean big results, given that the oldest 20 per cent account for 90 per cent of virus fatalities. If all goes as planned, then Israel will have downgraded Covid from a fatal virus to a bug which is nasty, but no longer the killer we have come to know.The vaccine idend should be discernible in Israeli hospitals very soon. Scientists at the Weizmann Institute reckon that the proportion of over-60s in critical care will have roughly halved within two weeks. By Easter, it thinks, most Covid deaths will be eliminated in Israel. It will be the first major country in the world to achieve this.And, all going well, Britain should be the second. Our vaccination programme is still steaming ahead. The Prime Minister’s first deadline – 13 million vaccinations by the middle of next month – remains in sight. Just over half of Britain’s Covid-19 deaths are amongst the over-80s, almost all of whom should have been offered a vaccine within a fortnight. Add another two weeks for the vaccine’s protection to set in, and the number dying from Covid-19 should be half what it would otherwise have been by the end of next month.This is the projection by the Covid-19 Actuaries Response Group, which has had a strikingly good track record since it was set up to monitor the pandemic. If Nadhim Zahawi’s vaccination programme goes roughly to plan, it says, hospital admissions will be half what they’d otherwise be by mid-March. Intensive care admissions would be down by only a third: a lower number because those admitted tend to be younger. But overall, the Covid-19 burden on the health service will look very different very soon.While plenty can still go wrong, ministers remain pretty confident – and more than they let on. Some in government think the official target will be easily surpassed – although they’ve been told never to confess as much in public. Kate Bingham, who masterminded the vaccine procurement programme, almost let the cat out of the bag recently by saying the schedule will be “met – and possibly exceeded”.If she’s right, and if Covid deaths fall by 80 per cent by mid-March, can lockdown restrictions still be justified? Politically, it’s a difficult question and battle lines are already being sketched out. Jonathan Ashworth, the Shadow Health Secretary, has said that we won’t be able to go back to normal “while the virus will still be circulating” – which it’s likely to keep doing throughout the summer. Even with hospital numbers down, he says, Covid-19 can still be a debilitating disease with lasting side effectsAt this point, what would Matt Hancock say? Once everyone likely to die from the virus has been vaccinated, would he be prepared to lift restrictions and be accused of letting the virus rip amongst the young?  I asked him recently and he hinted that he was ready for the fight. “There are many illnesses in the world,” he said. “We have to live our lives.”These words sound odd, coming from a minister who usually argues for tighter lockdown. Only last weekend he was privately arguing it was time to stop people exercising (ie, walking) with a friend. But there’s not necessarily a contradiction. In Israel, it’s argued that tighter lockdowns mean earlier relaxation – because the virus, if it gets out control, slows vaccination. The country’s Covid tsar, Nachman Ash, has said he’s ready to unlock even if virus levels are still high. “Our strategy is to inoculate the people who are at the highest risk,” he said, “so we can open the economy even if the number of infected has still not gone down.”Sceptics grumble that Israel’s example may not be so instructive because it’s unique: a tiny, highly-organised country with the world’s best digitised health records. It doesn’t need to slow things down by asking vaccinated people to wait 15 minutes to see if they suffer an anaphylactic shock: they know who’s at risk because their technology tells them. But the basic theory Israel is testing is that Covid’s power to kill can be stopped quite quickly. That, if proven, will be a universal lesson.Many Tories are getting nervous and want the Prime Minister to commit to relaxing as soon as the top-risk group are vaccinated. But he has an obvious retort: that it’s still a theory. Even Israel is waiting to see what the hospital numbers show, whether the theory pans out. All depends on how the relationship between infection numbers, hospital numbers and deaths really does change. Britain will find out soon, but not for a few weeks.This week, Netanyahu told his Cabinet that it’s precisely because they’re so close to the finish line that they need to keep discipline now. “This is how we will save lives,” he said. “This is how we will be first in the world to emerge from the coronavirus.” It would be quite a boast for Boris Johnson if Britain were to be the second.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"working mother unthanked hero lockdown","story":"Before I launch into this feminist apoplexy, a caveat: almost none of the complaints listed herein apply to me. I am, in terms of lockdown motherhood, about as lucky as a woman can be. I have a job that can be done from home, a husband who pulls his weight, a house big enough for everyone to find a quiet space in which to study, and an au pair who can oversee the children’s home-schooling while we work. None of our children have any mental or physical disabilities, they are all beyond the infant stage of total dependency, and their schools are, this time round, providing a full schedule of live lessons, which keeps them busy for most of the day.This concatenation of luck, privilege and timing makes it possible for a mother to survive lockdown with her career and her sanity intact. But it is vanishingly rare. No wonder most of the mothers I know say they are right at the end of their rope.This pandemic has been gruelling for parents of both sexes. A survey during the first lockdown found that fathers were doing roughly double their usual amount of childcare. But in relative terms, the ision of labour remained stubbornly old-fashioned: mothers still did 2.3 more hours of childcare than fathers, and 1.7 more hours of housework.Working from home is also much harder for mothers, because in most families they are the primary carers. Theirs is the sleeve that gets tugged first, whenever a child is confused or bored or squabbling with a sibling. During the first lockdown, mothers were only able to do one hour of uninterrupted paid work for every three hours done by fathers. They were also – not coincidentally – 43 per cent more likely to have lost or left their job during lockdown.Even as I write, I am distracted by a continuous tinkle of WhatsApp notifications from other parents at my children’s school, struggling to get into Teams or make sense of a homework task. Every single message is from a woman. Some are looking after small babies or disabled children, as well as trying to homeschool and hold down a job. “Too much! All too much!” wails one.And what recourse is there, when it becomes too much? Theoretically, the furlough scheme now extends to parents who can’t juggle work with lockdown childcare. But a TUC survey published this week found that more than 70 per cent of mothers asking to be furloughed for this reason have been refused. The same is true of fathers, but only 167 men have asked, compared with 3,100 women: a disparity that suggests men are still vastly less likely than women to see childcare as their responsibility.But most working mothers don’t want to be furloughed. Some can’t afford a 20 per cent pay cut. Some are afraid that, if they don’t make their presence sufficiently felt, the boss will start to think they are dispensable. Others, knowing that the companies they work for are under strain already, don’t want to be a nuisance. And some simply don’t want to stop doing a job they enjoy.And so the impossible, dreadful acrobatics continue: teaching with one hand, working with the other, and keeping the household aloft on one toe. This pandemic has produced many ordinary heroes. But none, I think, has been more ubiquitous, or less applauded, than the working mother.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk travel news ban restrictions south america portugal brazil","story":"Portugal has been grouped in with the South America travel ban for its \u0026#34strong travel links\u0026#34 with BrazilShould I book a holiday for spring? What is the GHIC, and how does it differ to the EHIC? How travel to Europe will change after Brexit New UK testing entry rules: everything you need to know Sign up to the  Travel newsletter A travel ban on 16 countries, incorporating the whole of South America, came into force at 4am this morning, amid concerns over the new Brazilian variant of Covid-19. However, there has been backlash from the travel industry as Portugal and its islands were grouped in with South America.Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, Tweeted to say he was taking “urgent” action to stop the Brazilian variant reaching Britain.Anyone who has visited or transited through one of the 16 countries will no longer be granted access to the UK. However, the ban does not cover British, Irish and foreign residents, who will be subject to a quarantine of ten days on arrival in the UK.Explaining the inclusion of Portugal, Shapps said: “Travel from Portugal to the UK will also be suspended given its strong travel links with Brazil.” The ban covers Madeira and the Azores, which have also now lost their travel corridors.However, travellers cannot get into Portugal from Brazil without a negative test at the departure airport, prompting uproar on Twitter as to why Spain – which has strong links to South and Central America – is not covered by the travel ban too. Paul Charles, travel expert and CEO of the PC Agency, said: If now is the window for stemming the potential new strain’s flow into the UK, then now is the time to ensure every possible entry point is plugged – and that includes Spain. At the moment, it’s a glaring omission, especially as there is so much traffic between Portugal, where entry from is banned, and Spain.Travel bans of this sort have previously been introduced for those travelling to the UK from Denmark and South Africa, as well as a number of southern African countries.Scroll down for more updates.Just two of the 15 destinations in Asia on the travel corridor list are open to UK arrivals, and both of them still have a 14-day quarantine requirement.

All arrivals into Bahrain will be required to undergo and pay for the enhanced arrivals testing procedure for COVID-19 and need to self-quarantine until test results have been received.The Saudi authorities require anyone who is travelling from a country where the new strain of Covid has spread to spend at least 14 days outside the affected country before entering the Kingdom. This includes travellers from the UK.“This month, so far we have had more bookings for those aged over-50 than in any full month since we relaunched in September,” said Hayley Chambers, head of customer operations at Thomas Cook. “It’s clear there’s been a return in people who will benefit the most from the vaccine roll-out booking their holidays for this summer and beyond.”There\u0027s also been a steady increase in interest among older customers for Unique Caribbean Holidays, the UK tour operator for Sandals and Beaches Resorts.

Essential travelling is those to allow transit, entry or exit from Portugal of nationals from the European Union or from Schengen associated countries, and their family members, and foreign nationals legally staying in a Member State of the European Union, as well as those for professional purposes, of study, family reunion, health or humanitarian reasons.Commentators have questioned why Portugal has been added to the South America travel ban, but not Spain, so  Travel took a peek at the arrivals boards of both Madrid Airport and Lisbon Airport to see which country has more air links with South America. It seems the confusion is understandable. Today (January 15), Lisbon will welcome just two services from the continent (flights from Recife and Sao Paulo), but Madrid will see 12. France will only allow non-EU nationals to enter with a PCR test, rather than the quicker, readily-available rapid antigenlateral flow test.The new rules will come into force on Monday (January 18).The quicker tests have been used by truck drivers transporting goods across the Channel between Britain and France.Asked about reports France would not recognise the red circle antigen test for people trying to enter the country from Monday, Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast: I think this is in reference to the French requiring what they call the PCR test.First of all, no one should be going to France. No one should be travelling.Secondly, we have a particular arrangement with the French regarding the hauliers, this is the lorry drivers, with tests which are called the lateral flow tests.And that remains in place at the moment.Epidemiologist Dr Mike Tildesley suggested the South America travel ban which came into force at 4am on Friday is slightly late but will still minimise the risk of the new coronavirus variant found in Brazil from entering the UK.Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Dr Tildesley said: We always have this issue with travel bans of course, that we\u0027re always a little bit behind the curve.With Covid we need to remember that when you develop symptoms you could have been infected up to a couple of weeks ago.So it\u0027s really important that these travel bans come in quickly so that we can prevent any risk. My understanding is that there haven\u0027t really been any flights coming from Brazil for about the past week, so hopefully the immediate travel ban should really minimise the risk.He added that scientists will know in the next few days whether the ban has had a significant effect.Germany has reported 22,368 new cases of coronavirus, taking the country over the two million mark. Angela Merkel is pondering a tougher lockdown as Germany exceeds two million casesThere have been 44,994 Covid-related deaths in the country.There\u0027s no contest, for Oliver Smith.My dream destination is a place where Britons are always welcomed with open arms, where the sun always shines, and which doesn’t involve a long flight. What I want is unspoilt island life, unpretentious food and accommodation, quiet beaches, walks through green, mountainous interiors, and a complete removal from the stresses of modern life.Allow Oliver to transport you to his dream destination, here.The Transport Secretary has insisted the British public should not take travel advice from him as growing pressure mounts on the Government to make sure the Brazilian strain does not derail the UK\u0027s vaccine plan. Pressed on whether it was wise for pensioners who have had the vaccine to book summer holidays, Grant Shapps told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: I am the last person you should take travel advice on this from.I remember about this time last year, or a little bit later, being asked whether I would book a summer holiday. We then had the travel corridors and I did book, I went to Spain with my family.And, within an hour of getting there, I, myself, put Spain... took them out of the travel corridor, meaning that I needed to come home and start my quarantine, leaving my family there.So, don\u0027t take any travel advice from me.Questions have been raised about whether or not the Government acted quickly enough to ban travel from South America and Portugal.Mr Shapps said they had been brought in because we do not want to be tripping up at this last moment.January 14 new cases: 68,656January 14 new deaths: 1,151The Brazilian coronavirus variant may infect people who have already recovered from Covid, scientists said as they called for urgent investigations into whether the new mutation can escape previous immunity.Research published last year suggested that 76 per cent of people in Manaus had contracted coronavirus by October, which should have severely limited onward spread of the virus. However, the city saw an unexpected surge of new cases last month and has now declared a state of emergency, with hospitals reaching 100 per cent capacity. Read the full report here.Travel expert Paul Charles, CEO of the PC Agency, told  Travel:Grant Shapps Tweeted last night to update the UK\u0027s travel corridors list. Chile, the Azores and Madeira lost their corridors due to the South AmericaPortugal travel ban. Qatar, Aruba and Bonaire, St Eustatius and Saba lost their corridors too.Anyone who has visited the following countries over the past ten days will no longer be granted access to the UK (excluding British, Irish and third country nationals with residence rights in the UK).Portugal (including Madeira and the Azores)Danny Callaghan, chief executive of the Latin American Travel Association, said: “It is vital that this travel ban is reviewed on an ongoing basis subject to the epidemiological situation and the associated risks and not just forgotten about or kicked down the road endlessly.“There is no doubt that the region’s tourism sector has been hit hard by the economic fallout which has meant that travel to the region, for the most part, has ground to a halt.

Conservative MPs from Red Wall seats signed a letter to the Chancellor demanding the temporary uplt to the leline benefit stays in place until lockdown ends. Boris Johnson signalled this week that the £-a-year increase brought in during the pandemic would end in April as planned.The Prime Minister told MPs on Wednesday he would rather see a focus on jobs and a growth in wages than focusing on welfare. He also claimed “the best thing is to get people into employment - despite the fact % of the .million Universal Credit recipients are already in work. Labour plans to force a Commons vote on making the uplt permanent on Monday.The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has warned that the cut could see another , children pushed into poverty. The influential Northern Research Group, representing Tories in the North and Midlands, put pressure on Mr Sunak for more support in the Budget in March. They want the Universal Credit uplt and business rate rebates to continue until lockdown ends, VAT slashed to % for businesses in the leisure and tourism sector, and stamp duty abolished for homes under £,. Chairman Jake Berry said: Lockdowns - although necessary while we wait for the vaccine to be rolled out - only entrench and compound disadvantage already felt by those communities this Government has promised to level up. Whilst we welcome the unprecedented support provided by this Government for those impacted by this virus, to relinquish support now would cause long-term damage to large parts of the North and weaken our recovery. Tory former Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb tweeted: Good to see colleagues in the Northern Research Group of MPs join call to extend Universal Credit uplt. UC has been especially important in Red Wall seats supporting low wage workers and those losing jobs.

The situation in London is critical with rates of the virus extremely high, which is why itaposs so important that vulnerable Londoners are given access to the vaccine as soon as possible. He said he would hold talks with vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi to ensure that we urgently receive an amount of the vaccine that reflects our size, density and the level of need in our city.

A spokesman for the NHS in London said: We have more than  vaccination sites up and running across London, including the NHS Covid- vaccination centre in the ExCeL London, and more are opening all the time.

While yesterday the Department of Health reported the highest ever death toll in the coronavirus pandemic so far - , - the case rate is dipping in London and other major regions, the latest weekly surveillance report from Public Health England says. In London, which continues to have the highest rate of any region, the rate of new cases stood at . per , people in the seven days to January , down from ,. in the previous week. The other regions recording a week-on-week fall are the East Midlands, eastern England, north-east England, south-east England and Yorkshire  the Humber. Three regions recorded a week-on-week increase: north-west England, south-west England and the West Midlands. What is the situation like where you live  Have your say in the comments section Yorkshire  the Humber continues to have the lowest rate: ., down from .. In yesterdayaposs daily figures from the Department of Health, the number of new cases reported in a -hour period was , - which is down on the record number of , reported on Wednesday last week. It comes as a senior epidemiologist says some parts of England are showing a plateau in cases of Covid-, while the rate of growth across the country as a whole is slowing. Professor Neil Ferguson, whose early modelling of Covid- made him a key player in the UKaposs first lockdown, said he thinks the current wave of the epidemic may be coming under control in some regions. In an interview with BBC Radio aposs Today programme, Prof Ferguson said: I think itaposs much too early to say exactly when case numbers are going to start coming down, but in some NHS regions in England and in Wales thereaposs sign of plateauing. London in particular is seeing a drop in the number of positive coronavirus tests, alongside the South East, he said. At the moment, it looks like in London in particular, and a couple of other regions - the South East and East of England -hospital admissions may even have plateaued, though itaposs hard to tell theyaposre coming down.  It has to be said this is not being seen everywhere. Both case numbers and hospital admissions are going up in many other areas but, overall, at a national level weaposre seeing the rate of growth slow. In yesterdayaposs update of the latest Covid- case rates for every local authority area in England, for the seven days to January , of the  local areas saw a fall in their case rates and two were unchanged. While saw a rise in case rates. Prof Ferguson, who is director of the Medical Research Councilaposs Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, said he would expect to see case numbers continue to come down slowly at a national level but with regional iations.  It will take longer though for hospital admissions - daily admissions - to start coming down and even longer for hospital bed occupancy to come down, he said. Asked how many more weeks of rising hospital admissions and deaths the UK could be looking at, he said: It critically depends on whether the lockdown weaposre in the moment will actually control growth in all areas. But I would hope that hospital admissions might plateau, instead of keep going up, some time in the next week. Hospital bed occupancy may continue to rise slowly for up to two weeks and deaths maybe even for longer.Weaposre going to be well over , deaths a day, even measured by the date people die rather than the date deaths are reported, before numbers start coming down. Prof Ferguson said the total number of deaths in the UK unfortunately is going to be well over ,, thereaposs nothing we can do about that now. Only about % of the population has been infected so far, which had resulted in , deaths, he said. So we have to get to very high levels of vaccine coverage in those vulnerable groups before we can reduce the risk of having basically the same number of deaths again.  If we only get up to  per cent coverage in in the elderly, for instance, that still leaves  per cent unprotected plus everybody . We can still get a very large epidemic, which unfortunately could kill many, many people, so what the modelling and all the analysis and all the groups feeding into Sagesays is, we need to be very cautious in how we relax restrictions and try to ensure we get as high a vaccine coverage as possible. Askedthere could be restrictions for many months to come, he said: Yes, and we canapost predict all of these things in advance. We couldnapost have predicted this new iant coming up, but the new iant without doubt will make the relaxation of restrictions more dficult because it is substantially more transmissible.  So it will be a gradual process to the autumn. Prof Ferguson suggested that the requirement to isolate after coming into contact with a person with coronavirus could be relaxed for people who have recently had the virus, such as NHS workers, but said this was a question for policymakers. It comes as Health Secretary Matt Hancock said three million coronavirus vaccines have now been administered across the UK. He tweeted that he was delighted with the news, adding: Weaposre accelerating the Covid vaccine rollout across the UK.  Prof Fergusonaposs comments came as some large high street pharmacies, including Boots and Superdrug, began rolling out Covid- vaccines. Six stores across England can administer the jabs from Thursday as the Government aims to hit its target of vaccinating around  million of those most at-risk by mid-February. People who are eligible for a vaccine will be contacted and invited to make an appointment through a new national booking service. This gives them the option of having the vaccine at a pharmacy or in a GP-led vaccination centre. Elsewhere, Englandaposs deputy chief medical officer, Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, has told the Sun newspaper: We are probably in the last few furlongs of this race, like in the Grand National. We just have a couple more fences. We have just got to stick with it.  Amid the warnings of struggling hospitals, the Governmentaposs leading scientist Sir Patrick Vallance has warned the country is in for a pretty grim period of deaths which will not reduce quickly. He told ITVaposs Peston programme that high death numbers will carry on for some weeks. Elsewhere, Public Health Englandaposs Siren study found that antibodies from past infection provide % protection against reinfection for at least five months. Although reinfections in people with antibodies were rare, the researchers identied  potential reinfections among , people who had had Covid- previously, putting them at risk of transmitting the virus to others. Full list of all the latest Covid- case rates for every local authority area in England Here is Wednesdayaposs update of the latest Covid- case rates for every local authority area in England. The figures, for the seven days to January , are based on tests carried out in laboratoriesand in the wider community . The rate is expressed as the number of new cases per , people. Data for the most recent four dayshas been excluded as it is incomplete and does not reflect the true number of cases.

Kristy Horton, who found the site, said she is finding it really dficult to carry on with regular le knowing that such a terrible thing was happening so close to her home. She had been concerned about the site in Caddington, Bedfordshire, for some time, and called police after spotting a wounded dog and heard barking coming from inside a locked container.What police found was shocking, reports HertsLive.Kristy, , said: It was awful. It was probably the worst thing Iaposve ever seen. Iaposm finding it really dficult to carry on with regular le knowing that was happening so close to me and also that itaposs happening all over the country.Do you think the law is strong enough when it comes to animal cruelty  Have your say in the comments sectionIn total five dogs were removed from the alleged puppy farm outside Luton after Bedfordshire Police gained entry on January  following Kristyaposs call. Kristy, who recalled it was an incredibly distressing thing to witness but remarked that she and a group of residents had been suspicious of the site for a while - and seeing the wounded dog made her know she should act. Recalling the timeline of events, Kristy said that after phoning the police and the RSPCA she took the wounded dog to a vet. She had a horrible wound on her face and had blood everywhere, she looked seriously unwell, Kristy said. I probably could have got in a bit of trouble for deciding to take the dog straight away, but I couldnapost leave her there, my conscience just didnapost let me. Kristy said she later ed and entered the locked container with the police - who were helped by Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service - and saw five more dogs that looked extremely unwell. Their cages were full of faeces, and some didnapost even have enough space to turn around so were covered in their own filth, Kristy said. They were all very obviously underweight and they were obviously terried as well.  They were happy to see us when we came in but as we came closer they started cowering, she said. Amy Carpenter, , who also saw the site, said: I said it at the time and it still stands, this is the worst thing Iaposve ever seen. Itaposs disgusting, how someone could treat another living creature like that I donapost know. Itaposs heartbreaking. There was one Staffy in particular who was really skinny. You could see every single bone. There was also one dog there who had obviously had a huge number of litters, you could tell that her body was spent from having litters.  Both women said Caddington residents were shocked that this could happen in a small village like theirs. This is a small, dog-loving village. We all know each other really well and thereaposs a big community who love to walk their dogs together, Kristy said. I donapost think any of us could have expected something this horrible to be going on here. Itaposs something you see on the TV and in the news but this has opened my eyes a bit that this can be happening right on your doorstep.  The animals were removed from the location and placed into the care of RSPCA, which is now dealing with the incident. A spokesperson from Bedfordshire Police said: We were called at .pm on Thursdayover animal welfare concerns at a site in Caddington. Police gained access to the site with help of Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service and discovered five dogs.

Jenny Anderson had pulled over in a lay-by and was ordering medical supplies for her horse when the incident took place on Wednesday.She claimed the lorry pulled into the lay-by at an angle which made it almost impossible for traffic to pass, Plymouth Live reports. The two men then climbed out and started relieving themselves with one in full view of Jenny at the back of the lorry, she claimed. Jenny, , said the other worker was at the side of the vehicle and was only partially visible. She said: My reaction was just aposoh my God, I canapost believe they just did that.Have you seen anything similar  Let us know by contacting us at webnews@mirrorThey do these adverts to aposWalking in the Airapos but this guy was peeing in the air.

I thought aposwhat’s he doing  He put it in reverse and then left it at a strange angle for what is a country lane. I thought aposwhat a stupid place to leave a lorryapos. I thought it was a bit odd, but when him and the co-driver started walking towards me, I thought they wanted directions so I locked my door because I was a woman on my own and there is the risk of Covid too, but then the guy just undid his trousers and started peeing by the back of the lorry. She said the men spoke to each other and looked at the startled woman but carried on urinating. She said: He was just laughing and took no notice of me. I couldn’t go past without getting an eye-full so I had to wait for them to finish. I thought ‘this is a long pee’ - it took absolutely ages. The guy eventually finished, gave it a shake and then looked back at me. Then they just drove off.

Theyaposre saying aposthis is safe, youaposre safeapos, and then itaposs not, and then it is, like, I donapost think the Government knows [...] they just donapost understand it. [With coronavirus] you canapost see it. So, you know,there was a gunman on the loose outside or a sniper, you wouldnapost go outside, would you, because thereaposs a chance that youaposre going to get shot. Fortunately for Nancy, both of her childrenaposs schools have been very supportive.  Tia was due to move to secondary school in September, but after a risk assessment they agreed with Nancy that she was vulnerable and could stay at home. Weaposve just got loads of books, and weaposre teaching her le skills, Nancy said. But sheaposs happy. This is the main thing. Sheaposs got a mental age of about a five year old, so sheaposs happy to play with dolls. So sheaposs really not a problem. And Iaposm glad the school decided that sheaposs too vulnerable to go in because it saved me a massive fight. Nancy says the one-to-one interaction she is able to give Tia at home means her hand control has improved in the last year, but she does worry about her missing out on friendships at school. Tyler is currently having some one-to-one Zoom lessons at home with Nancy describing his experience as been really quite bad.  He was in school, I think, for a couple of weeks, but couldnapost cope with all the changes, all the rules, and [had a] major meltdown, said Nancy. He was put on a reduced timetable. So he was only in school for two or three hours a day. It had a massive impact on his mental health. She added: He also struggles to learn virtually. He canapost go on to a Zoom, and watch what the teacher is trying to show him. He literally has to have somebody behind him. Fortunately some money was provided by the local council to help Tyler and other children with similar needs. In addition to his one-to-one Zoom lessons he is also being given more creative and practical work to do, such as learning how to rewire a plug.

But since lockdown began, she’s enjoying more time with her husband Piyus, , and daughters Sienna, nine, and seven-year-old Isla at their Northampton home.“I really like being at home with the girls, and I know this is going to sound really bizarre, but I love home schooling,” says Sheena, .“Both girls have Zoom at am, so when they’re doing that, I’ll be doing my work. They have their designated study areas and I encourage them to work independently, but I make sure I’m present sothey need me, they can come and get me.”Sheena, who’s written a book, Perfectly Imperfect Mum, believes that it’s important for mothers to take the pressure off themselves.“Seeing people making perfect meals on Instagram can make us feel guilty and start judging ourselves,” she says. “As long as we try our best, that should be good enough. If you want to have beans on toast or chips, that’s OK.”Sheena is one of many people finding ways to embrace their time at home and make the most of lockdown.New restrictions are in place, with people all over the UK being urged to stay at home to stop the spread of coronavirus, protect the NHS and save lives.There’s light at the end of the tunnel with thousands of vulnerable people being vaccinated every week, but for now everyone must play their part by avoiding mixing with others. What’s really helping Sheena feel calm during lockdown is practising mindfulness. “Whether we’re eating meals, brushing our teeth, looking at our phones and watching TV, we’re always multi-tasking,” she says.“So we started practising mindfulness as a family and creating our own little videos so that other children could benefit. We go on little mindfulness walks, becoming more aware of our surroundings.“A simple technique is when we’re eating at home, we feel grateful for the food and then talk about where it came from. You start appreciating food you’re eating and feel fuller, rather than always thinking, ‘What can I eat next ’”As an active family who love to travel, the Tanna-Shahs have had to get creative during their time at home – and they’ve found themselves trying activities they’d never have imagined doing.“None of us are dancers at all, but we thought, ‘What can we do to make things more fun ’ so we filmed ourselves doing a dance to Super-heroes by The Script and shared it online,” says Sheena. “Before lockdown, I would have never dreamt we’d do anything like that!“My daughter loves Enid Blyton books, so we did a midnight feast outdoors and looked at shooting stars – it wasn’t something we’d normally dream of doing. And we went to Woburn Park at am last summer to watch the sunrise. We’re living in the moment, and not worrying about what everyone  is doing.” Although getting out in the fresh air is important, Sheena is happy to find alternative ways to exercise at home. “In winter, it’s really important to go outside and get your vitamin D, but maybe the weather ’s cold and wet,” she says. “So we bring that exercise indoors – as long as you’re moving and having fun, that’s great. There are so many things the kids can do online, whether it’s PE with Joe or yoga.”There are things we can all do to look after our mental wellbeing at this time.

It has been really nice – one of those things that has transferred really well from in person to online.“We’ve all made an effort to pick slightly shorter books to make it feel more relaxed. We’ve tried to choose books that are  pages tops as I think we’ve all found it hard to concentrate during lockdown.“We get to share books and we’re all able to introduce our own favourite types of books.” She says she and her friends have also tried a supper club, where they cook something over video and then sit down and eat and chat together.And evennot everything Flip has tried has been such a success, some ventures have still raised a few laughs. “Our choir also went online with hilarious results,” she says. “It might not have worked quite as well online, but it has still been fun.“The head of the choir has tried a new method where we all sing but our inidual laptops are muted, so we’re just singing at our screens.”For your mental health action plan, visit Clear Your Head today.

Their other daughter Bryoni, , is working as a paramedic, and son Ben, , is teaching in Thailand.“Now we all have more time on our hands we are looking to get fit and eat a healthier diet,” says Nettie. “We are cooking a wider range of dishes than we would usually, based on recipes from books at home and by going online. There are lots of amazing recipes out there. It’s all about trying dferent ingredients.”The family have also got a newfound interest in fitness. Nettie explains: “None of us are usually runners, but we are doing the Couch to k, which helps you build up your fitness gradually. We’ve also got a treadmill in the house. We’ve only been doing it since January , but we’re already feeling a lot better.” Rediscovering hobbies has also been important to Brian and Nettie.“Brian has taken much more of an interest in gardening,” says Nettie. “We’ve also been doing a lot of redecorating.“And I’ve made about  masks for nurses out of material around the house, using a template from the internet.“Alice is trying to set up a sustainable clothing business.

It found that those who suffered from the coronavirus and had symptoms had a  per cent chance of avoiding falling unwell again with the disease over the next five months. When people who had caught the virus but had been asymptomatic were taken into account, that number fell to  per cent. PHEaposs Siren Study will now continue to see how long natural immunity tends to last for among people whoaposve caught the bug. According to an overview of multiple dferent studies into Covid-, around one in five people who catch the virus experience no symptoms. With .million people having officially tested positive for coronavirus in the UK, according to Department of Health data, hundreds of thousands may have caught the bug and acquired immunity without suffering any symptoms. Many others who believed early last year, when scientists thought the virus was still contained in China, that they had the cold or flu, may in fact have caught coronavirus and now be immune. Here is a list of the telltale signs that you may have had Covid- and might as a result now be immune. It should be remembered that people who have caught the virus donapost have a free pass to start living like everything is normal. Professor Susan Hopkins, senior medical adviser at PHE and the Siren study lead, warned: We now know that most of those who have had the virus, and developed antibodies, are protected from reinfection, but this is not total and we do not yet know how long protection lasts. Crucially, we believe people may still be able to pass the virus on. This means, evenyou believe you already had the disease and are protected, you can be reassured it is highly unlikely you will develop severe infections, but there is still a risk that you could acquire an infection and transmit to others. Memory loss and brain fog  An unpleasant and in a lot of cases long term effect of the coronavirus is a kind of mental fogginess. Many sufferers of long Covid have reported having trouble thinking clearly for months after getting over the first part of disease. On Thursday Labouraposs Andrew Gwynne said that his memory was shot to pieces. The MP explained he began to feel grotty and run down in March, went on to display Covid- symptoms, and his initial illness lasted for about  days although he still feels the effects today. The MP for Denton and Reddish told the Commons: My condition is not as severe as it was even just a few months back, there have been real improvements, but itaposs been a hard slog to get here. For the first seven months or so the exhaustion came back frequently and to the point where doing just simple tasks around the house brought me out in massive sweats like Iaposd run the London Marathon. I had lots of dizzy spells, Iaposve never had vertigo before this, and oh the brain fog - in a job where you have to be razor sharp, my short-term memory is shot to pieces. Iaposve had to learn to pace myself, trying to push my limits would set me back. Covid tongue  According to Professor Tim Spector more and more people are heading to doctors complaining of issues with their tongue. The Kingaposs College London epidemiologist, who heads the Covid Symptom Study App, said that the disease seems to cause tongue changes including pain, discolouration, swelling or a strange texture. Seeing increasing numbers of Covid tongues and strange mouth ulcers, Professor Spector tweeted. If you have a strange symptom or even just headache and fatigue stay at home! If you are suffering from tongue issues it might be because youaposve had Covid-, or that youaposve got one of a number of other conditions which can be the result of poor mouth hygiene, smoking or an unhealthy diet. Stomach ache  Some coronavirus patients have suffered stomach aches for weeks after catching the bug. The American Journal of Gastroenterology published a study suggesting the virus could cause digestive problems such as diarrhoea. It analysed data from  patients in China, discovering that . per cent of them had tummy issues such as vomiting, abdominal pain or diarrhoea when they were first hospitalised. This is another symptom which may indicate youaposve had the coronavirus, a host of other conditions or simply too large a dinner last night. Eye infections This symptom is a relatively rare one, but still thought to impact around  per cent of the millions of people whoaposve had the coronavirus. Doctors warned eye infections may be another sign of Covid-. Chy Earnest, a nurse at the Le Care Centre in Washington, said that red eyes are the ‘single most important’ sign that patients have COVID-. Speaking to CNN she explained: “They have, like...allergy eyes. The white part of the eye is not red. Itaposs more like they have red eye shadow on the outside of their eyes.” Other people have reported symptoms like conjunctivitis. Fatigue  After weeks of lockdown in the depths of the winter, it may seem dficult to tell coronavirus linked fatigue with general burnout. Yet sufferers of this common long Covid symptom compare it more to a aposflatliningapos sense of exhaustion than typical tiredness. The symptom can have a crippling impact on peopleaposs lives and turn the simplest of tasks into a huge struggle. If youaposve been finding yourself low on energy, then you may be one of  per cent of people a World Health Organisation study found had Covid linked fatigue. Laboured breathing  The images of people struggling to breath on ventilators will be some of the most enduring of the pandemic. While the horrors acute patients suffer in intensive care wards are well understood, research into the impact seemingly mild cases of Covid- can have on lungs is only just beginning. A lot of people who were asymptomatic to begin with have found themselves struggling to breath in the months since being infected. If you are finding it hard to catch a breath oryour partner has noticed youaposre breathing more heavily than normal, then you may be suffering from Covid-linked lung damage. Hair loss  Although not one of the tell-tale signs weaposve been told to watch out for during the pandemic, hair loss may indicate youaposve had the coronavirus. Doctors have long linked unexpected balding with recovery from fevers. Enid Child shared a picture of her hair loss months after both her and her son tested positive for coronavirus The grandmother-of-four, from Pencoe, originally fell ill in mid September, and tested positive for the virus days after. But it was not until she was referred to her doctor in November that she learnt her hair loss was linked to Covid-, usually emerging in patients months after their diagnosis. The -year-old said: The photo I posted was one morningaposs brush worth. Thataposs why I bagged it - I was going to my doctors to get my first lot of bloods to check my iron levels and the rest because my iron levels had dropped. My practice nurse was quite shocked when she saw me. She asked does it come out voluntarily. I just put my hand up - by then my hair was waist- - and ran my hand through my hair and I got another handful. She said aposI think you better speak to a doctorapos. The doctor phoned me that afternoon and that was when it was confirmed it was an effect of long Covid. She added: My hair has gone really really thin. Yes it still covers my scalp and things but I have lost an awful lot of hair. Anxiety and insomnia  Another symptom that is not the easiest one to spot - given the mental strain many are under each day at the moment - but researchers believe Covid- can lead to anxiety, depression and insomnia. Scientists from the University of Oxford analysed electronic health records of  million people in the USA, including over , Covid- patients. Their analysis revealed that in the three months following a positive Covid- test, one in five survivors were found to get a diagnosis of anxiety, depression or insomnia for the first time. That’s about twice as likely as for people without Covid-, according to the researchers. Hearing loss and tinnitus In November a study was published which showed many people suffered from hearing loss for months after catching the bug. Researchers from Anglia Ruskin University looked at the hearing problems affecting Covid- patients, both in the short and long term.In the study, the team analysed , Covid- patients with tinnitus - a condition that causes a constant ringing or buzzing in the ears.The analysis revealed that  per cent of the participants experienced a worsening of their tinnitus amid their Covid- infection. And while the majority of participants had pre-existing tinnitus, a small number reported that their conditions as initially triggered by developing Covid- symptoms. Dizziness  Another classic sign of Long Covid, and one which seems to sneak up on a lot of previously asymptomatic patients, is dizziness. Feeling suddenly wobbly or unsteady on your feet may be a sign youaposve had the virus. Dean Dobson was off for work for months due to a particularly bad case of long Covid. “Itaposs the worst thing Iaposve ever had to experience in my le,” he said.

So when the property lived in by Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie was replicated in painstaking detail, viewers jumped at the chance to make it their own - but unfortunately things didnapost quite turn out as planned. Back in , Pepsi and Fox launched a competition to win the home, which had been built in Nevada, US, and at the time cost , to complete. The job, carried out by Kaufman and Broad homebuilders, was done to perfection, bringing every small detail to le both inside and out of the fictional home found at  Evergreen Terrace in Springfield, where the Simpsons have lived for more than  series.After taking every available reference from trawling more than  episodes, the orange house was designed with four bedrooms, two bathrooms, the signature bay windows and driveway at the front, as well as the treehouse and barbecue in the garden. The bright interior design was matched every step of the way, with a yellow and blue tiled kitchen floor and orange sofa with a framed picture of a boat hanging above.  Tiny details including light fittings and Duff beer cans were replicated, along with a fake peanut butter and jelly sandwich under Bartaposs bed, Homeraposs hard hat hanging on the bannister, and even food for the cat, Snowball II. When it came to make the prize draw and hand over the keys, the winner was announced to be retired factory worker Barbara Howard. But Barbara lived almost , miles away in Richmond, Kentucky, on a farm where her husband raised animals and crops, and she ultimately opted to take the , cash alternative instead.She told the LA Times : Honey, I’d give my eyeteeth to pick up and move there, but my family being in the shape it’s in, I can’t.Ultimately, the house was stripped out, given the same subdued sand colour finish as its neighbouring properties, and the interior was redecorated and refurnished to appear as a house like any other.

Whether you wanted to is a dferent matter, with many of us having watched the blockbuster reluctantly, after complaining that we know the ending already. But, like a few constants in le - death, taxes and birth - watching the three-hour film is something weaposve all done. Regardless of whether you loved the film or couldnapost stand it, youaposll definitely have a view on who was to blame for Jackaposs death. Many blame Rose for letting him freeze to death - arguing that there was *definitely* room on the wreckage for both of them to surviveonly sheaposd just moved.Even Kate Winslet agrees that he could have fitted. But director James Cameron has insisted that they wouldnapost have both fitted - and he did make the blockbuster after all. Either way, we suggest you spend some of your time in lockdown rewatching the film. Because one womanaposs theory on who is to really blame for Jackaposs death has gone viral. Shared on TikTok, the video of the woman explaining her theory has been viewed more than two million times. And itaposs certainly unlike any other theories weaposve heard on this subject.  She explains: Everyone always says that Jack could have survived the TitanicRose just scooted over a little bit on that tiny little door. But Iaposll tell you who is really at fault for Jackaposs death. She then points to a picture to Frederick Fleet, the lookout who was the first one to spot the iceberg. Butheaposd been using binoculars he would have seen it much earlier.  The woman dramatically continues: This is the man who is responsible for Jackaposs death. He is the one that failed to see the iceberg in the first place. She adds: But who really is this man you may ask  My father... before showing a photo purportedly of her dad standing in front of the TV screen while the film plays.

Arkady Aksenov was riding on moving cargo carriages in Russia when he fell onto the track and his limbs were sliced off by the wheels. The boys he was with - aged  and  - ran away and “left him for dead”, but he miraculously survived. Arkadyaposs left leg was torn off completely, up to his buttock and he also lost his right leg but the cut was lower. The youngster was saved by passing train driver Bulat Zhakeev, who disobeyed rules to stop his engine, give first aid by preventing more blood loss, and summon emergency services. The boyaposs devastated mum Maria Petrova has gone public on the horror case to publicise the acute dangers from an escapade that has become popular. The yoga teacher’s furious and heartrending post on social media is addressed to the two boys she claims bullied her son to take part in the deadly activity in St Petersburg, and their parents. “Boys, you who study at the same school as Arkady and who have been pushing him to try train surfing and make a video for YouTube ‘to become famous’,” she wrote. “You who threatened him to get on that train. “There were two of you, aged  and , your names and addresses are of course established.”  The older boy is an “experienced” train surfer with his own YouTube Channel, it is claimed. She posted: “They left him wounded, bleeding. “They didn’t panic, but quietly left, through the bushes. “They didn’t try to run towards people so that they could have been seen by the accident place. “They were certain that there were no CCTV cameras on the railway, which is true, and that Arkady would die and not say a word.  “You little idiots! “If you were to call help, you would have been heroes. “Yes, people would have said that it was a pity you started it all, but they would have said well done to you not to have left your friend in that horrible hour. “You won’t be punished for what you’ve done. “By law, you won’t be punished because you are children and you are not subject to the law.  “Your parents won’t be punished either, because there is no clause in the Criminal Code which sends you to jail for being a bastard and for raising a bastard.” Maria attacked the parents of the boys, saying: “You didn’t even call me.” The mum-of-one is training to become a lawyer, she said. “Give it up, it’s obvious that you are a **** of a lawyer. On the other mother, she said: “I wish I could tell you to stop drinking.  “But I doubt you would ever be sober enough to read my advice.” She told them: “Live with it. “I wish that every night a bloodied boy without legs comes to your nightmares, stretching his arms towards you, and begging you to help. “His nails are broken off, his fingers are dirty because he was fighting the force of the train, holding himself on so that the train didn’t pull him under completely.” Maria has watched -minute footage of Arkady - a keen martial arts fighter before the tragedy - lying by the track in -C temperatures until the passing train driver stopped “to save my son’s le”.  The driver said: “I noticed a large dark spot from the corner of my eye, and thought it was soil not covered with snow, when suddenly it moved. “It was a person who somehow lted himself off the ground, and pushed away from the track.” He thought at first it was a homeless man who had sought to cross the tracks.

The despot regime unveiled what appeared to be a new submarine-launched ballistic missilein a provocative move. The despot was pictured at the event, thought to have been held in capital Pyongyang today. A grinning Kim, clad in a leather coat and fur hat, waved as he oversaw the parade in Kim Il Sung Square, photos released by state media showed. The parade featured rows of marching soldiers, as well as a range of military hardware including tanks and rocket launchers. At the end, a number of what analysts said appeared to be new types of short-range ballistic missile and SLBMs rolled into the square on trucks. The worldaposs most powerful weapon, submarine-launch ballistic missiles, entered the square one after another, powerfully demonstrating the might of the revolutionary armed forces, news agency KCNA reported. Pyongyang is under international sanctions for its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.Military aircraft were spotted releasing fireworks information, said NK News, a website that monitors North Korea, citing a source in the city.  On Wednesday, Kim Yo Jong, the leaderaposs sister and a member of the party Central Committee, criticised South Koreaaposs military for saying it had detected signs of a parade in Pyongyang on Sunday. The move was an expression of the Southaposs hostile approach towards the North, she said in a statement. Leader Kim and other North Korean officials had packed into an indoor stadium in Pyongyang on Wednesday to watch performances from military and civilian art troupes and youth groups. The performance was the latest in a series of largegatherings this week where Kim and the other attendees did not appear to wear masks or follow other social distancing measures. North Korea has not reported any confirmed coronavirus cases, but it has imposed strict border closures, domestic travel restrictions and other measures to prevent an outbreak."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.57546805-2-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.57546805-2-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.57546805-2-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.57546805-2-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"dundee supermarket worker pleading with the shoppers to wear masks","story":"A supermarket worker is pleading with shoppers to please wear a mask while in city stores.The woman, who has asked to remain anonymous, said her plea comes after one shopper blatantly ignored mask guidelines, while wearing a t-shirt claiming there was #no pandemic.#It comes as Morrisons warned it would now ban shoppers from entering its storesthey don#t wear a mask, unless they have a medical exemption.The worker, who has worked on the checkout in one of Dundee#s major supermarkets for  years, said this latest incident was the last straw, after months of putting up with verbal abuse from customers.She added that, despite rising Covid- positive cases, the number of shoppers who refuse to wear a mask is increasing.And she said that the worse culprits are younger people in their s and s, who think they are #invincible#.Now the supermarket worker is pleading for shoppers to wear masks and to have a little bit of respect for herself and her colleagues, who are among the key workers who have worked continuously to keep essential shops open during the pandemic.She said: #This last year has been tough to say the least.

If I’m angry, you’ll see that I’m angry. If I’m excited you’ll see that I’m excited.

I have to get better at that, maybe count to  then start reacting.“It is dficult because football is very instinctive.“It is hard to control your emotion and that is why players get booked for dissent.“But I understand what the government are saying – I get that.

People tell me they are getting better and better, but # having seen players get injured on them  -they have concerned me for a number of years.When you watch games, the games that are played on these surfaces they are so dferent from matches played on grass with the way the ball bounces and the way the players move.But as I understand it the selling point of these astroturf pitches is to be able to deal with freak weather and allow games to be played.mdash Aberdeen FCJanuary , However, that hasn’t been the case at Almondvale, so what’s the point in having them Watching from home, I didn’t think the pitch looked too bad.But referee Steven McLean inspected the synthetic surface just before the game was due to kick off, he also consulted with the players about it and they felt it was unsafe.Fair play to McLean, that was sensible refereeing, because ultimately it’s the players who are taking the riskthe game had been started.Player safety is paramount, so from that perspective postponing the fixture was the right call.But the whole point of these astroturf #all-weather# pitches is they should allow more games to be on because they can withstand heavy rain like there was on Wednesday.I can’t ever recall a plastic pitch not being able to withstand rain.But, after Wednesday’s debacle, astroturf pitches should be banned from the Premiership.There are three of these surfaces in Scotland’s top flight at Livingston, Hamilton and Kilmarnock, and for me they shouldto grass.If you have a grass pitch with undersoil heating that should stop things like snow or frost putting games off and, when it comes to heavy rain, what happened at Almondvale shows astroturf can be affected by a torrential downpour as much grass.Meanwhile, Aberdeen will hope toto winning ways against Ross County tomorrow.The Reds didn’t play too badly against Rangers last weekend, but, once Ryan Hedges was sent off, it was always going to be a dficult task.Sitting third in the league, there is still plenty to be positive about for Aberdeen, but they won’t get it easy in Dingwall.John Hughes’ management style is all about hard work and getting as much as he can out of the players, as a result the Dons will have to outwork Countythey’re to pick up the points.Scott Wright’s seemingly impending Aberdeen departure is very disappointing.I’m a big fan of the attacker who has started to produce his very best this season.Wright has only really begun to cement himself as a regular in Derek McInnes’ side this term and I thought the -year-old would see himself being a key member of this Dons team for a number of years.However, that does not appear to be the case with a possible move to Rangers on the cards.If Wright was to go to Ibrox, he would have quite a task trying to play regularly given the form of Steven Gerrard’s squad at the moment.Moving to the Gers will provoke a backlash from Dons fans as well. While nobody likes to see talented players leaving Pittodrie, joining one of Aberdeen’s main rivals makes it more of a bitter pill to swallow for supporters.Wright will have his reasons for wanting move where, but it’s still frustrating from a Reds perspective.It remains to be seen whether the Aberdeen youth academy graduate will move in this month’s transfer window or whether he will leave in the summer.Although Wright still has plenty of offer on the pitch for the Dons between now and the end of the season,he has made his mind up about where he wants to go next, I think it would be best for all partieshe moved sooner rather than later.The decision has been taken to postpone football below the Championship for the rest of the month and I think it’s the right decision.With a few exceptions, the clubs, players and coaches involved are part-time and have jobs outside of football.I know some will be working from home, but not all of them can and some will be in workplaces with other people.And, with Covid- infections on the rise, cancelling football for a few weeks means one less environment where these people may be at risk of catching the virus.With the Premiership and Championship continuing, I know plenty of players and coaches in the lower leagues are keen to carry on, but hopefully come next month they will be able to.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"heathers treks from castle dounie to serpentine ridges","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world but now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. www.heatheryheightsDuring wintry weather and shorter days it can be tricky fitting in longer walks and time for exploring the outdoors.What is fantastic about Knapdale and Kintyre is that we only have to go a short distance to gain truly spectacular views. The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring. Re-join your ascent route, taking care on the way down. Turn rightat the forest road it is now an easy km back to the junction with the bench. Turn right then left after m, following the path back to Crinan harbour.*You can also drop down the firebreak and turn right on the track to join the route up to Cnoc Reamhar,continuing along the ridge does not appeal.The described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities.

Here we spotlight some of the deserving stars that Prime Minister Boris Johnson applauds as “an inspiration to us all”.Last year brought to the fore a new breed of community champions# including those working in the NHS to treat coronavirus patients, scientists developing effective vaccines and key workers keeping essential services operating.These “ordinary people” who continue to go above and beyond have been recognised for sterling work delivered in extraordinary circumstances.The  New Years Honours has recognised champions of sport as well as stars of stage and screen but this year, more than ever, it is ordinary people who have been recognised alongside them. Among the deserving recipients are leading lights who have battled to save lives and keep the NHS afloat and those who have kept the country smiling by spreading kindness.The list includes medical experts as well as volunteers working with youngsters, the elderly and those with disabilities. Those working in libraries, education and community arts also received recognition. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “In a year when so many have made sacrices to protect our NHS and save people’s lives, the outstanding eff orts of those receiving honours are a welcome reminder of the strength of human spirit and of what can be achieved through courage and compassion. “The  New Year Honours offer us an opportunity to salute their dedication and recognise many who have gone above and beyond in their contribution to our country. “As we begin a new year and continue to come together to fight this virus, may their service and stories be an inspiration to us all.”"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures a look back at 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Some do exist, however, and while not attempting to be a comprehensive history, there is a nicely illustrated booklet about the hospital and its past entitled #Up The Brae#, produced a few years ago by Brenda Bratt, Jess Grant and my former colleague Dr Grace Fergusson .These photographs are a reminder of the loss of a signicant social and economic element in the fabric of Mid Argyll, where for generations it would have been dficult to find a family without some connection to #the AB#. For those who worked there, myself included, any sadness however is much more about the loss of a self-sufficient and widely respected mental health service.I was a late participant in the story of the AB, being appointed physician superintendent in , a post I held in addition to that of clinical director for mental health services for Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire until , and I feel a duty to the many splendid colleagues with whom I worked to comment on the loss of the service in which the AB served as the nucleus.During the course of   the hospital was awarded the accolade #Best Mental Illness Hospital in Britain# as the result of a national competition launched by the King’s Fund and sponsored by the Sunday Times. This was a recognition of the multi-disciplinary spirit and enthusiasm for innovation that characterised the service, and the ethos of best clinical practice being led by academic excellence. The service went on to be recognised as a centre of excellence by many visiting accreditation bodies.My reason for making these points has nothing to do with nostalgia.The past has no utility in the present or the future except as a source for learning how best to proceed.The ingredients for a good mental health service are the same today as they were in  and they have little to do with buildings or even location. Staff have to feel they #belong# to something there must be a collegiate spirit binding together the ious disciplines shared professional development and peer support and clear lines of accountability. It is frankly hard to see any such features in the current delivery of mental health care.Someone once said #psychiatry isn’t sexy#, meaning that in any competition for resources with other clinical specialities, psychiatry will always lose, and so to get the best out of the NHS for folk with psychiatric disorder, exceptional effort is required. The achievements and values of the past can act as a springboard for such effort, but here they seem to have been squandered by a distant and disinterested health board.It is all too easy to avoid investing in a service by reorganising it into invisibility, but the people who pay the cost are those who deserve the best of specialist professional help.So I am certainly sad at the disappearance of the old AB, because it is symbolic of something having been lost that is much more important than stones and mortar.Professor Angus Mackay OBE FRCPsych, ArdrishaigSir,Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns over whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But though customers# usage of data more than doubled, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m also proud of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.We#ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland Director, Alexander Graham Bell House, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 8 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

the vaccine might contain gelatine, or other animal products and is not halal, or that it can result in modication of DNA.Around  mosques are using Friday prayers to raise coronavirus awareness and dispel myths around vaccinations, and Imams have agreed to be filmed being vaccinated in a bid to ldquoinspire confidence in their communities and show that jabs are permissible and halal.Imam Asim said: ldquoSome of the campaigns that have been run mdash we are seeing that because of the webinars, people are changing their views on these vaccines and there is a greater uptake of these vaccines

Because the coronavirus lockdown was nationally mandated, insurers argued they did not have to pay out.Other arguments hinged on a precedent set in a  High Court case which found that an insurer did not have to pay out business interruption insurance to a New Orleans hotel after hurricanes Katrina and Rita.The insurer only had to compensate the hotel for direct damage the hurricane caused, and argued that the hotelrsquos business would have been interrupted whether or not it was directly damaged, so only paid out part of the insurance.ndash What happens next The case was never meant to iron out all dficulties, just to get clarity on some common issues that many policyholders were running into when trying to get a payout.ldquoTodayrsquos judgment does not determine how much is payable under inidual policies, but provides much of the basis for doing so, the FCA said.Insurers decided to pay out claims on some policies after an earlier High Court ruling on the issue.

Thorne Security says it could have a system in operation for £,, less than half the amount the  previously thought it would cost.The system would include four cameras to cover Main Street, Longrow, Burnside Square and the area around Hall Street and the cross.Four special television screens at Campbeltown Police Station would allow the police to watch the pictures from the cameras. The images would be recorded on an industrial-quality video recorder at the station. The pictures could alert the police to trouble or help them trace offenders.The team from Thorne Security will be visiting Campbeltown at the end of January to demonstrate the equipment.The secretary of the , Sergeant Douglas Reid of Campbeltown police, has already contacted the Scottish Office for more details about the funding package. Sergeant Reid said: ‘The  is fully committed, following the tremendous public response, to go in as far as possible along this road.’The  is already planning to apply to other local and national bodies for contributions towards the cost of the system.The Scottish Office’s challenge competition will make funds available for groups representing local communities to bid for money to fund CCTV systems.Applicants from dferent areas will bid in competition with each other for a share of the government cash.The first town centre security camera system in Scotland was set up in Airdrie three years ago. New research shows that in the first two years after the system was set up, the crime rate plunged by  per cent.The Scottish Office says there is no evidence that crime was simply being shted to areas outwith the reach of the cameras. Instead the total amount of recorded crime actually fell.FIFTY YEARS AGOMcCartney again!Mr Paul McCartney, ex-bass guitarist with the Beatles, has recently purchased from Mr A Revie, Loch Ranachan Farm, which comprises  acres and adjoins his other farm, High Park.Mr McCartney has been spending a few days on the farm with his we and family over the festive season.One happy Rangers fanMr Crawford Morans of  Albyn Avenue, who is employed with the Ministry of Social Security, has had a good ending to the old year.

In the Clyde, however, the Board of Trade did not insist on this in respect of vessels trading exclusively within what is known as the smooth water area.This area was within an imaginary line drawn from Skipness Point to Fairlie. On the date in question, the accused conveyed a cargo from Glasgow to Tobermory via the Crinan Canal.As soon as he had left Crinan, he was in contravention of the regulations, having entered the more hazardous waters off the west coast.On behalf of the accused, an agent stated that he had traded with the Bloodhound for nearly  years. During the war, the ship had been requisitioned by the Ministry of Shipping, and under the orders of that department had been sent outside the limits of the smooth water area.The accused had naturally thought that what he had been doing during the war, when he traded to ports on Islay and the Ayrshire coast, he was free to do now.Sherf Macmaster Campbell imposed a penalty of £."},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 1 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They race out of their cars to help people load shopping into the boot, or help elderly people into the car, and often carry the heavy bags to customers# homes.Taxi drivers are a leline for elderly people all across the country and I hope ours know that we notice all the little things they do to go the extra mile.Name and address supplied.The fact that UNICEF, the UN’s child protection wing, will, for the first time, intervene to support those at risk of hunger in the UK, is a damning indictment on the depths to which the UK has sunk.UNICEF has put its funding behind a scheme designed to provide breakfast boxes to , families over the course of the Christmas holidays – marking the first emergency response in the UK by the organisation since it was founded in .Rising levels of food poverty in the UK are an absolute disgrace and the Tory Government should be ashamed of this.We are supposedly one of the richest countries in the world.

A year that saw so many things we took for granted taken from us – our normal family events, our employment and our interaction with our friends.In true Kintyre style, we found ways of minimising the effects of these disruptions by using technology, supporting the vulnerable and keeping in touch by telephone. But it was a scary time for all of us.When this #Thought for the Week# was in the planning stage, we imagined that in our corner of Scotland, in Kintyre, we would be well rid of strict lockdowns, have a low position on the tier system and le would be getting back to some sort of normality. We are not there yet.When parents are bringing up children, they teach them by repetition – clean your teeth tidy your bedroom I love you, you are special.God, as our Father, does exactly the same. In the Bible, more than  times He says: #Do not be afraid# or phrases that mean this. Let us take this truth into the New Year with us.Let us all pray that soon we can say we are not afraid and what a dferent year  is.#Away, then all fears.

Here we spotlight some of the deserving stars that Prime Minister Boris Johnson applauds as “an inspiration to us all”.Last year brought to the fore a new breed of community champions# including those working in the NHS to treat coronavirus patients, scientists developing effective vaccines and key workers keeping essential services operating.These “ordinary people” who continue to go above and beyond have been recognised for sterling work delivered in extraordinary circumstances.The  New Years Honours has recognised champions of sport as well as stars of stage and screen but this year, more than ever, it is ordinary people who have been recognised alongside them. Among the deserving recipients are leading lights who have battled to save lives and keep the NHS afloat and those who have kept the country smiling by spreading kindness.The list includes medical experts as well as volunteers working with youngsters, the elderly and those with disabilities. Those working in libraries, education and community arts also received recognition. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “In a year when so many have made sacrices to protect our NHS and save people’s lives, the outstanding eff orts of those receiving honours are a welcome reminder of the strength of human spirit and of what can be achieved through courage and compassion. “The  New Year Honours offer us an opportunity to salute their dedication and recognise many who have gone above and beyond in their contribution to our country. “As we begin a new year and continue to come together to fight this virus, may their service and stories be an inspiration to us all.”Jacquie Winning’s award “recognises the achievements of everyone” at Forth Valley Sensory Centre following “an exceptionally challenging year”.The  year-old from Falkirk was recognised for going the extra mile to manage “wraparound” services to people with sensory loss during the pandemic “COVID- has been challenging for everyone, but more so for people with sensory loss. Those with hearing loss face challenges due to face masks and social distancing interfering with their ability to lip read.“Those with sight loss face signicant challenges managing to maintain physical distancing while undertaking essential trips out,” explained the MBE recipient.Jacquie’s support included providing Braille copies of virus information, establishing telephone, text and email befriending lelines to address isolation and producing podcasts providing vital updates.“The impact is that some of the most vulnerable people in society have been incredibly well supported during the most challenging of times. Thanks go to the dedication, enthusiasm and willingness to adapt by our team, volunteers and partners, and tremendous support of our board of directors.”Cabinet Office confirmation of Dr Tamas Szakmany’s award made him “astonished, touched and humbled”. The  year-old from Newport explained: “I thought I was doing my job like everybody . I didn’t think for one minute it would result in this. I’m really surprised. Once I was allowed to talk about it, the first thing I said was how fortunate I was to work with this team. “ was dficult professionally. Personally, I had many successes. It was a double-edged sword. The MBE is recognition for the enormous effort everyone has made to get us through the first wave. I hope we have similar success again.”The Royal Gwent Hospital critical care consultant, recognised for exceptional service to the NHS, spearheaded Welsh Critical Care Network response during the pandemic, rapidly disseminating information on lessons learnt via traditional and social media s. Filming his personal and professional le, he helped produce an emotional deeply personal documentary “Critical: Inside Intensive Care Coronavirus” episode, broadcasted by BBC Wales and included among American Society of Chest Physicians and Society of Critical Care Medicine teaching materials.A Belfast community worker is celebrating “the surprise of his le” after being honoured. Michael Briggs’ MBE was rewarded for services beyond the call of duty in the voluntary sector and community.“Even though we’ve hardly moved out of the office, it’s all been pretty busy,” explained the EastBelfast Community Development Agency Executive Director.“We’ve been managing our COVID programme, buying bulk food to get out to groups we support. We developed a network of groups delivering small packages to people who are vulnerable, shielding or in financial need.” The  year-old continued: “There are so many stories from older people who say ‘it’s just good to know people are thinking about us.”Thinking the honour email was promotional, Michael initially “didn’t actually take it seriously”.He revealed: “I nearly didn’t open it. Then I saw it was from the Cabinet Office. “For me, it’s about the efforts of other people as well.“So many people have been very supportive over the years. I’m the one who ends up getting the award, but other people have been involved in the success of my work.”A British Red Cross refugee support staff emergency responder initially thought his honour announcement email was spam! Golam Chowdhury was then “humbled” when his British Empire Medal was confirmed. “I had no idea I had even been nominated,” said the -year-old from Portsmouth.“It’s been challenging, both personally and professionally, but I am always amazed by human resilience and community spirit. Watching how people come together to support each other has been incredible.”Involved in active frontline response to COVID- in Hampshire as a Refugee Support staff member, Crisis Response South East tactical cell weekend coordinator and local Emergency Response, City of Sanctuary and Cycling UK volunteer, Golam received his accolade for outstanding achievements in healthcare during the virus pandemic.“I don’t do my job – or my volunteering – for praise,” said the father-of-two. “I do it because,the tables were turned and I was the one that needed help, then I would hope that there was someone out there to support me. “I’d like to dedicate my award to everyone in all communities who are helping others.”For more information on Honours recipients, go to gov.uk honours"},{"url":null,"title":"leader january 8 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

More than £ million of this we have been grateful to receive at Sightsavers.Money raised by players has been indispensable in helping Sightsavers to fund, in  alone, eye services for more than , people and more than  sight-saving cataract surgeries.In , funding also helped us to support the Covid- response. Children with disabilities kept learning throughout the pandemic, thanks to distance learning equipment and teacher training, PPE and hygiene kits.Children like Marie in Sierra Leone, who is blind and was in danger of being left behind when schools closed, until she was given a typewriter, a radio and assistance so that she could keep studying.So, once again, a big thank you to all the players in Scotland for your generosity.To find out about some of the lives being turned around by players# support, please head on over to www.sightsavers.org ppl or give Sightsavers a call on   .Dr Caroline Harper CBE, Sightsavers CEO.Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns on whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But, although customers’ usage of data more than doubled during the period, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m proud also of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.While BT Group continues to invest billions in these networks, we know that we can’t do this alone. We’ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland director.The  Covid crisis has prompted a greater sense of social cohesion and solidarity but it also exposed and exacerbated some of the barriers that blind and partially sighted people still face.Access to online shopping slots, a lack of essential health information in formats such as audio and braille, and confusion over whether social distancing allowed for blind and partially sighted people to still be guided added to the distress many felt.The first lockdown came out of the blue when we had little real-le experience of managing a national emergency, but it is now more essential than ever that we learn the lessons and ensure no one falls through the safety-net. Another period of enforced confinement during the winter months could hit some particularly hard.During the first lockdown, RNIB Scotland and other charities worked extremely hard to ensure the needs of the most vulnerable were met # at a time when even the most able in society were thrown by the suddenness and uncertainty the crisis had created.We negotiated set online shopping slots for people with sight loss, worked with public bodies to ensure the often vital information they put out was available in formats accessible to everyone, and claried the rules on guiding people with a visual impairment.These gains must be reinforced  we are ing to another nationwide lockdown.Currently, around , people are living in Scotland with signicant sight loss. Although most are over the age of , around , children and young people also have a visual impairment.The RNIB Helpline remains available on    and information continues to be broadcast on RNIB#s Connect Radio station. The RNIB Talking Book library posts and downloads thousands of titles in audio and other formats.Find out more at www.rnib.org.uk scotlandJames Adams, director, RNIB Scotland.As always in such matters, the UK-EU Brexit deal will iniably throw up more than a few surprises aside from the usual headlines heralding a British #victory# in negotiations.The fact that, for example, seed potatoes are not to be included in the deal will be deeply damaging to our rural economy. Scottish seed potato farmers are one of the biggest exporters of potatoes, used in the production of chips and crisps, in the world.The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, Edinburgh."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 8 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

First Minister Alex Salmond, speaking in an exclusive interview with the Campbeltown Courier, said thathe and his government fail to save the Skykon factory, it won’t be for want of trying.Negotiations are taking place behind the scenes and he has met with potential buyers.The Courier asked the first minister the question that everyone in Kintyre would ask him, especially the -plus workforce left in the lurch at the wind turbine tower manufacturer at Machrihanish after the collapse of its Danish owners: ‘Can you save the factory ’Mr Salmond said: ‘Nobody can give an absolute promise. At this stage, these are dficult negotiations but I am deeply committed to this plant and I am going to strain every sinew to save these jobs, not for the first time but for a second time. I am hopeful that it can be done.’He added: ‘I have been personally in touch with potential buyers of the Machrihanish factory.

And the effects are far from over.Even with social distancing, there are still many ways you can fundraise for us. From hosting a virtual quiz or coffee morning to selling handmade crafts, cakes or old clothes, we’ve got lots of great virtual fundraising ideas you can try while following the Scottish Government’s advice on social distancing.By volunteering just a couple of hours each month, fundraising in your local area, you can help make  a better year for children.So please think about using your new year passion and enthusiasm to come up with some ideas to fundraise and help us be there when children need us most.To find out more or to request your fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk support-us events-fundraising new-year-challenge or email jen.lindsay@nspcc.org,ukJen Lindsay, community fundraising manager for NSPCC Scotland.A new survey by the Stroke Association shows that  per cent of people in Scotland don’t know that high blood pressure is the biggest risk factor for stroke, one of the leading causes of death and disability in Scotland.This is really worrying because . per cent of people in Scotland have high blood pressure.Smoking, drinking alcohol, being physically inactive and sitting for long periods, can contribute to high blood pressure, diabetes, and being an unhealthy weight, all of which increase your risk of stroke.You can start to reduce your risk of stroke by making small changes to your lestyle.To launch the first ever national Stroke Prevention Day on January , we’ve worked with our partners at the Rotary Club, LoSalt and OMRON Healthcare to help you make #OneSmallChange to reduce your risk of stroke.It’s often easiest to start off small and pick something that’s achievable for you.This may be swapping your after-work alcoholic drink for a soft one, getting up and moving regularly during the day, cutting down on salt or sugar, or joining an online exercise group.Just go to our website www.stroke.org.uk PreventionDay and receive tailored advice plus monthly emails with hints and tips.We would like you to pledge to make the change for three months, then let us know how you get on and how you found ways of sticking to your pledge.The things you tell us will help others across the UK to reduce their risk of stroke and lead a healthier lestyle in .Juliet Bouverie, chief executive, The Stroke Association. "},{"url":null,"title":"theres light at the end of the tunnel but for now embrace lockdown life","story":"Wyvex MediaUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

which are located on the seaward side of Musselburgh Racecourse.A large part of the -hectare ash lagoons has already been reclaimed, grassed and transferred to East Lothian Council ownership, providing a habitat for wildle, with the last two lagoons also earmarked for the haven.However, Mr Jamieson says the wildle proposals are a \"wasted opportunity\" and is urging council bosses to look again at the trusts race track proposal.He said: \"It is scandalous that this valuable site will not generate any local income from birdwatchers, butterflies and seagulls.\"The opportunity to generate income from millions of visitors to support local businesses and the local economy will be lost.\"Two years ago, a proposal to bring a world-class Formula  race circuitwas presented to the council.\"I

I had predicted this protest but explained my reasons.ldquoItrsquos a really ancient tale, made by someone called Aesop, who made lots of stories we know. They are fables, which means they are short tales with a moral, and so many of them have become famous with dferent versions and...Skye interrupted my flow: ldquoI know, dad, like the lion and the mouse story.ldquoYes, well remembered.ldquoAnd the hare and the tortoise, she added with a grin.ldquoYes, well there are lots of them, all with their dferent morals.ldquoAnyway, as I was about to say, we donrsquot really know much about who Aesop really was, but it is said he was a slave in ancient Greece two-and-a-half-thousand years ago, and he won his freedom because of his cleverness, but wersquoll never know for sure. There are remarkable stories about his le, who knowsthese are true.ldquoCan you tell one of those stories then, dad  said Skye, not missing a trick.ldquoOh, er, well I will, but not tonight, because tonight I am retelling one of his famous tales in a dferent way, to show that stories can be told from dferent points of view, and then the moral we take from them may be a dferent one.The tale for this evening was the boy who cried wolf, a very well-known Aesop fable which has evolved and changed over the centuries, but the essentials have remained.ldquoWhatrsquos the moral in this story  I asked the kids.ldquoIf you keep telling lies then people will stop believing you, even when you tell the truth, said my -year-old Manja.ldquoYes, and thatrsquos a good moral. But now I want to tell the same story in a dferent way, and letrsquos seeyou find any dferent morals in it,ldquoOK, as long as you tell us the stories about Aesop tomorrow, bargained Skye.ldquoAgreed, I said and the kids settled for the tale.lsquoOnce there was a lad called Peter, who because he was  years old was given the responsibility of looking after the sheep on the hill above the village.He was told by his father: ldquoIf a wolf comes, blow this horn as loud as you can and we will come running to help you.He was proud to be given the responsibility and sat by the fire keeping warm, feeling very grown up. But as it got dark the moon came out and Peter saw strange shapes on the hillside. They were moving slightly and he couldnrsquot decide what they were. It seemed they were crawling towards him. It wasnrsquot a wolf but he became very scared.So he blew the horn as hard as he could. He heard the sound of shouting and running feet as his father and other villagers came running up the hill.ldquoWherersquos the wolf  asked Peterrsquos father.ldquoI donrsquot think they are wolves but therersquos something scary over there, he replied. His father looked and shook his head.ldquoThey are just bushes and trees, swaying in the breeze, explained his father angrily. ldquoYou have called us up here for nothing. Irsquom angry and disappointed in you. Do not do that again.He left with the villagers and reminded Peter: ldquoBlow that horn only when there is a wolf.Peter felt angry and disappointed with himself. But now he understood that it was just the outline of the trees and bushes in the moonlight, so he wasnrsquot scared of the shapes anymore.He sat by the fire eating his supper. It was a warm, cosy fire and it made him miss home and his family. His father had always told him that the warmth of a fire was for sharing, but he had no one to share his with. His head began to fill with stories and riddles, but there was no one to share these with either.He wasnrsquot scared anymore but Peter began to feel lonely. He had the sheep but they couldnrsquot solve riddles or listen to stories like his younger siblings, or sit with him by the fire and share its warmth. The fireside was always a place where his father told stories and his mother sang. Now he was alone and sadness overcame him. Hersquod never felt lonely like this.So he picked up the horn and blew it as loud as he could. Once again, the sound of shouting and running feet was heard as Peterrsquos father and his neighbours came running up the hill.ldquoWherersquos the wolf  asked his father.Peter looked down at the ground: ldquoWell, therersquos is no wolf, father, itrsquos just I was so lonely by the fire all by myself and...But he didnrsquot get the chance to explain. ldquoThere is no wolf  said his father angrily. ldquoI can hardly believe you have called us up here once again for nothing!Peter looked down at the ground and apologised, and promised he wouldnrsquot call them for nothing again. His father and the neighbours ed to the village in an unhappy mood.Peter settled down by the fire once again but this time he heard growling and when he looked up there really was a wolf. So he blew the horn as hard as he could. But there was no sound of shouting and running feet. So he blew again. Still nothing.So he shouted ldquowolf, wolf! in between blowing the horn, but his cry of wolf was ignored, because his father and the villagers didnrsquot believe him.The wolf seemed to understand the opportunity and so ate or killed all the sheep.rsquoSo the story ended. I sat back and looked at the kids for their reaction.ldquoWell, thatrsquos a dferent way to tell the story are there dferent morals in it  I asked.ldquoWell, Peter did blow the horn when there wasnrsquot a wolf, just like in the story in the book, but it wasnrsquot really for nothing was it  It was because he was scared, and then lonely and sad. It is the same story, but then again isnrsquot, reflected Manja.ldquoItrsquos from a dferent point of view, added Skye.ldquoAnd what morals or lessons do you see in this version  I asked.Well we had quite a discussion and I think an important one for the children at this time. Irsquoll leave you to have your thoughts on it.Except to say that we are all Peter sometimes, and whatever reason we feel the need to call for help ndash and there will be many dferent ones for dferent people in dferent circumstances ndash they are all legitimate, eventhere is no lsquowolfrsquo."},{"url":null,"title":"dunbars-abbey-ruins-mystery-friars-walk","story":"THE celebrated North Berwick postcard artist Reginald Phillimore was fond of painting scenes from his home town and from Gullane, Dirleton and the Bass Rock, ranging from the castle ruins of the mighty to the humble cottages of the poor.Since he also liked Dunbar, not less than  of his postcards are from this East Lothian coastal town, which was popular among the tourists in Edwardian times.Some of his cards depict standard sights like the Castle Ruins and the Town Hall one has a quaint little cottage at Cleikum Toll and another the Loverrsquos Walk, a rump of which still exists.One of his most interesting cards , from a historical point of view, depicts the ancient Abbey Ruins at Friarscroft: they were quite a rural scene in Edwardian times, with sheep grazing and some old cottages in the background.This Trinitarian abbey was founded by the Countess of Dunbar in , as one of eight known houses to have been located in Scotland.The abbey still stood in  but it fell into a gradual decline the remaining friars moved away, and most of the stoneware of the church was taken away for local building projects.A  map shows that by this time, only the tower stood, being used as a dovecot.In , a group of archaeologists and antiquaries made excavations near the dovecot tower, finding the original tiled floor of the church, but no trace of an original dwelling-house for the friars anywhere nearby.Since the old friars had built their tower sturdy and strong, it still stands today , looking virtually unchanged since Phillimorersquos time.The only sheep to be found anywhere in the vicinity are the lamb chops for sale at the Co-op supermarket, although the cottages in the background remain more or less unchanged.Friarrsquos Walk, also known as the Monkrsquos Walk of Dunbar, is a more mysterious matter.This structure is still largely in existence, consisting of two parallel ancient sandstone rubble walls stretching southwards from West Port.It has been presumed that Friarrsquos Walk must have some connection with the Trinitarian abbey, and that the part connecting it with West Port is a later addition.The northern part of Friars WalkAlready in Victorian times, Friarrsquos Walk was used to dump rubbish and garden refuse from the gardens of the houses on High Street, but the entirewas passable within living memory.When examined by the archaeologists in , it was largely filled with earth and quite overgrown when I explored it in , things had not improved in the slightest.What might have been, through the deployment of a sergeant-major and  unemployed youngsters armed with shovels and saws, one of the leading tourist attractions of Dunbar has been left to fight a losing battle against decay.There does not appear to be any other instances of ancient double walls with a narrow walkway between them, and the Dunbar local historians have speculated what use had been made of Friarrsquos Walk in olden times.One rather adventurous hypothesis is that the Trinitarian monks used the walls as a walkway from their abbey to another building, perhaps their dwelling-house.When ended at its southern extremityby the construction of a Georgian or early Victorian building, Friarrsquos Walk is heading straight for what is today the grounds of the Priory, my own house in Dunbar.No ancient ruins ever existed in these parts, as far as can be discerned: a postcard from Edwardian times, stamped and posted before work on the Priory was begun in , merely shows farmland and market gardens.Maybe the friars had their garden here, growing fruit and medicinal plants Another speculation is that one of the walls of Friarrsquos Walk represents a substantial fragment of the post-medieval western town wall.Since at least the western wall of Friarrsquos Walk has several blocked doorways, a rationalist would instead suspect that it was intended as a rear lane to the houses on High Street, used for the removal of rubbish and garden waste.The mystery of Friarrsquos Walk is a profound one, and unlikely ever to be solved."},{"url":null,"title":"chance-say-proposed-crematorium-old-craighall","story":"Westerleigh Group wants to build the facility off the A, on the opposite side of the carriageway from the Musselburgh Service Area, close to the junction of the A with the City of Edinburgh Bypass at Old Craighall.The -acre site ndash sandwiched between the eastbound carriageway of the Bypass and westbound carriageway of the A ndash would include a chapel, parking and a landscaped garden of remembrance.

elite football being given an exemption to continue amid the pandemic.ldquoNonetheless, the continuation of football at all levels has weighed increasingly heavy on me as president, my colleagues on

mass transportation of untested, largely part-time players is something that cannot be sustained as the cases continue to rise and available hospital beds become increasingly scarce.ldquoAfter discussions with the SPFL, the Premiership and Championship will continue on the proviso that both adhere to the existing testing regime.ldquoThe vast majority of teams in those isions are full-time

Tranent, had asked East Lothian Council planners to change a condition demanding access roads from the A into the new housing were upgraded before any residents moved in.Instead, it argued that a new study had shown that up to  houses could be occupied before any work was needed to improve the major access routes.Concern about the impact of the new town, which will be accessed off the Bankton interchange on the A, has been raised repeatedly by concerned members of the local community as the project progresses.But at a virtual meeting of the councilrsquos planning committee this week, the change to the condition was approved, after elected members ruled that the need to see houses on the ground at the settlement took priority.Despite some misgivings about the study, which insisted the traffic created by the first  homes being occupied would have a minimal impact on current movement, councillors backed the move.Councillor Kenny McLeod told the committee: ldquoNow is the time to get the foot down on this [project] and get it moving.The first residents of Blindwells, which will eventually see an initial population of ,, are expected to move in this September.East Lothian planners initially approved the building of the first phase of houses with a condition which required upgrades to the Bankton interchange, including traffic control signals at the roundabouts and additional

committee that Blindwells was ldquoone of the most important developments in our local plan.He said: ldquoIt is important this site moves forward, it has been so long in the waiting.ldquoIt is also important not to impose conditions on applicants that are onerous and can prevent it going forward.Some elected members voiced disappointment that no representative of Hargreaves took part in the

they are not the only supermarketscracking down on shoppers not wearing face coverings whilst shopping, a number of supermarkets have also announced that they will be doing the same.Tesco, Asda, Aldi and Waitrose are the latest to tighten their rules around shoppers wearing face coverings, stating that shoppers without medical exemptions will be refused entry to their stores.An Asda spokesperson said: ldquoIf a customer has forgotten their face covering, we will continue to offer them one free of charge.ldquoBut should a customer refuse to wear a covering without a valid medical reason and be

coverings, customers are also being urged to shop alone.They said: ldquoWe are also asking our customers to shop alone, unless theyrsquore a carer or with children.ldquoTo support our colleagues, we

refuses to comply.Andrew Murphy, executive director of operations at Waitrose parent company, the John Lewis Partnership, said: ldquoBy insisting on the wearing of face coverings, over and above the social distancing measures we already have in place, we aim to make our shops even safer for customers.Aldi chief executive Giles Hurley also said: ldquoThe safety of our colleagues and customers is our number one priority.ldquoWearing a mask is mandatory for everyone that shops at Aldi, except for the small number of people who have a medical exemption.While a number of supermarkets have clamped

customers ldquomust take responsibility for wearing a face mask.She said: ldquoWersquove increased our in store messaging to remind customers and government guidance does state that the police can

responsibility to keep themselves and others safe.The renewed dedication to ensuring shoppers comply with government rules regarding face masks comes after supermarket staff revealed the abuse theyrsquove faced for challenging customers for not wearing a face covering.A Tesco worker from Gloucestershire said she was ldquohorried by responses she had received after challenging customers, adding: ldquoI find, and so do my colleagues, that itrsquos not as strict as the first lockdown.ldquoWe have people refusing to wear masks, customers not social distancing.ldquoI asked a customer where his mask was and he hit the roof, telling me [Covid-] is not real, and itrsquos the government making it all up - I was horried.An Asda staff member at a store in north-west Meryside added:

But this adversity will create opportunity, rebuilding and rethinking the way we do business and how we support our communities.While calls to focus on the social aspects of the economy have become more insistent in recent years, Covid- has fuelled their urgency. Our norms have been questioned and there is a real desire for change. Business leaders have prioritised wellbeing, communities have responded by supporting each other through the crisis, and new and innovative ways of being economically viable have come to the fore.Research by Co-operatives UK showed community ownership models are helping to create a new generation of UK businesses that are better equipped to withstand the Covid- crisis, or any economic crisis of this scale. Focusing on community shares, a way of funding community co-operatives, the study finds that of those businesses who have raised finance this way, a remarkable % are still trading.Since , pound million has been raised by more than , community share investors across the UK to save and create more than  vital community spaces and businesses.Community co-operatives are run by and for their community, with profits generated invested back into those communities. They can have a signicant positive impact whether they provide a service, deliver economic growth, or contribute towards the health and wellbeing of the local community.The model is particularly suited to Scotlandrsquos economy due to the prevalence of rural communities. Sectors including retail, hospitality and tourism can be the main employer in rural locations, particularly for young people, playing a key role in safeguarding jobs and retaining young residents. Businesses within these sectors can be run as community co-operatives allowing the communities, sometimes overlooked by traditional businesses, to create new jobs while protecting vital services or developing exciting new opportunities.During the initial response to the pandemic many of these businesses had a greater understanding of their communitiesrsquo needs, helping them to adapt and innovate during the crisis and putting them in a strong position to not only weather the economic storm but to thrive.The Community Carrot, a community-run shop in Dunbar, East Lothian, went from supplying  vegetable boxes per week before the pandemic to  during the first lockdown. Strong and well-established local supply chains with mills and farms, something local chain shops didnrsquot have, meant all orders were fulfilled and deliveries to vulnerable customers were guaranteed. The Community Carrot has signicantly grown its customer base on the back of the reliable and reassuring service it is able to provide during dficult times.The economic and social potential of community co-operatives is signicant and should be more widely adopted in Scotland. Combined with the greater community spirit that has been cultivated during Covid-, now is the right time to champion community co-operatives that can sustain jobs and communities and deliver wider economic, social and environmental benefits.Clare Alexander is Head of Co-operative Development Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"rosemary-goring-surely-unsung-supermarket-heroes-bumped-list-vaccination","story":"Being on the retail front line during the pandemic cannot be much fun. Shortly before Christmas a weary-looking assistant in Tesco told me that he gets regular abuse from customers. ldquoYou wouldnrsquot believe it, he said. Before reaching me, he had been serving a woman who appeared to be anticipating Armageddon rather than lockdown. Her elderly companion in a mobility scooter was helping her to pack, setting each item as carefully into the bags asit were a Ming vase. Despite the queue building up, the till assistant was a model of patience and cheer, and the feel-good effect rippled down the line, putting everyone in a better mood.As customers grow lax about safety, and shops grow overcrowded, staff are starting to protest against the daily health risks they are obliged to run. With people abandoning masks, refusing to sanitise and licking their fingers before counting out money, you understand why they might be anxious. :Country Le with Rosemary Goring: Snow brings cold comforts Stores are among the riskiest places you can be, in terms of catching Covid. Before the virus had begun spreading as fast as it presently is, a study in England last November showed almost a fth of infections were linked to a shopping trip.With the new iant now galloping across the British Isles, it is sobering to reflect that every outing for groceries is like running a gauntlet. Whether you emerge unscathed depends on factors completely out of your hands ndash namely, other people. Most of us are now schooled in donning a mask, wiping trolleys and sanitising our hands on entering, but once over the door, the threat multiplies.: Country Le with Rosemary Goring: Snow brings cold comfortsSome remain oblivious to social distancing, seeming determined to encroach on your patch. Filthy looks over the rim of a mask make no impression whatsoever. What can you do but step back  Yet while I try to stick to the rules, occasionally I struggle with one-way systems, and find myself backtracking at speed. Taking a wrong turning and discovering yoursquore going against the flow reminds me of the day when, oblivious to a no-entry sign, I drove down an Edinburgh street to find a tram heading straight for me.In shops, the people Irsquove seen who donrsquot follow the prescribed route around the aisles are not usually deliberately breaching the code or ignoring the signage, but are elderly and a little bewildered. Being vintage does not, of course, mean you cannot be carrying the virus, but such slip-ups do not inspire the same outrage as the aggressive attitude of wilful rebels. In this category I include folk taking children around the store, asthey were on a trip to a theme park.Recent announcements by Morrisons and Sainsburyrsquos that they will bar anyone not wearing a face covering, without proof of medical exemption, have been swtly followed by Asda, Tesco and Waitrose. This is to be welcomed, above all by their staff. It is one thing for most of us to do a swt weekly raid for essentials, quite another to be in contact with the public for hours on end. Nor should shop workers have to act as law enforcers.:From a winter wonderland to an ice-bound hell In light of the Selkirkincident, itrsquos understandable why someone would hesitate to confront a customer without a mask, or urge them to keep a distance. Some shops say they tell staff not to challenge those who wonrsquot wear face coverings, since it might be for valid medical reasons. Presumably they also donrsquot want them to run any risk of verbal or physical abuse. Sadly, that is little comfort for shoppers in their vicinity, and even less for the checkout operative who, despite screens, masks, visors and gloves, has no alternative but to be uncomfortably close to them for as long as it takes to ring through their goods. Since supermarkets have done well during this crisis ndash and eventhey had not ndash they should have trained security personnel at every branch, to enforce the rules.Given the level of contact shop staff have with the public, should they be prioritised for vaccinations  All who fall into the higher risk categories, whether by age or medical vulnerability, will already be among the first to receive it. But what about the rest  If staff in care homes and the NHS are getting the jab, should not supermarket workers too  Thatrsquos certainly the argument of Usdaw, the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, whose concerns on this front have been heightened by the recent deaths from Covid  of two staff from Tesco in Greenock. Usdaw is also urging ato the stricter protocols of the original lockdown in March, when, among other measures, the numbers of customers was closely monitored.In an ideal world, shop workers would be protected ahead of those who can continue to work from home or in isolation until the pandemic is under control. Realistically, in the current race to deploy supplies of vaccine most effectively, I donrsquot see them being bumped up the queue. Defining who would be eligible would be a mammoth task in itself.Nevertheless, therersquos no doubt that supermarket staff should be recognised in the same breath as those who work in the NHS. Ask someone what they do, andthe answer is a nurse or doctor, peoplersquos faces tend to light up. If they say they work in Asda, the response tends not to be so enthusiastic. Yet it should. They might not be dealing with patients in intensive care, but now, more than ever, the shelf stackers, online order processors, delivery drivers and those at the tills deserve utmost respect and admiration. Without them, the cogs of our lives would cease to turn within a matter of days, and where would that leave us "},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12221179.jpg?type=article-full","title":"uighurs-china-stands-accused-genocide---must-raise-voices-late","story":"Then in November, Genocide Watch said Chinese actions against the Uighur people should be considered ldquoacts of genocide, and issued a Genocide Emergency Alert.Since then ndash what  Almost deafening silence globally.

Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab also proposed a review of export controls to Xinjiang province ndash the epicentre of the Chinese onslaught against Uighurs.British politicians, ever slow to lt their eyes beyond their own limited horizons, have at least taken some action and brought the issue to public attention. But in truth, this is a shamefully weak response. If we could get in a time machine andto , how might we want our political class to act towards Nazi Germany Uighurs prayChina is engaged in a policy of mass incarceration of the Uighur people within an archipelago of concentration camps, where therersquos forced sterilisation, slave labour and torture.

Chinese officials have the power to live in Uighur family homes to lsquoaid assimilationrsquo. Prisoners have been used for organ harvesting. Uighurs are subject to mass state surveillance. Chinese firms use advanced technology to track Uighurs. Huawei is among a number of companies which have refined articial intelligence so that Uighur characteristics can be spotted in a crowd.The Uighur people are being wiped out one way or another. Not only is their culture being destroyed, China appears to be literally culling Uighurs via medicine ndash sterilising them into oblivion. Rendering women infertile ndash or lsquoencouragingrsquo marriage to Han Chinese men ndash can have only one intent: the destruction of an entire race of people. Some have stopped sort of calling whatrsquos happening in China lsquogenocidersquo, preferring to refer to it as lsquocultural genocidersquo. Semantics, though, mean little to those behind the barbed wire of a concentration camp.Uighur prisoners are subjected to mass indoctrination and brain-washing within Chinarsquos gulags. The objective is clear:these people are ever released, their minds are no longer Uighur. At least . million people ndash but perhaps as many as three million ndash are prisoners in these concentration camps. Children left without parents are taken to state orphanages.Leaked documents show Xi Jinping making comments such as ldquowe must be harsh on them and show absolutely no mercy.

Money stops mouths.: Rosemary Goring: Surely our unsung supermarket heroes should be bumped up the list for vaccination So far,  countries have denounced China at the UN, including the UK, America, Australia, Belgium, Denmark, Canada, Italy, Ireland, Japan, Spain, Poland, Norway and Sweden. Some  countries defend China, including: Russia, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Belarus, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Morocco, Myanmar, North Korea, Sudan, Syria and Zimbabwe.The bitter irony is that many Western governments have shorn themselves of much of their moral authority over the last two decades. Think of Guantanamo Bay and lsquoBlack Site prisonsrsquo ndash the Westrsquos own gulag extraordinary rendition ndash state-sponsored kidnapping of suspects without trial enhanced interrogation techniques or torture, such as waterboarding colluding with repressive regimes in the abduction, detention and torture of overseas terror suspects.

Deal with the mote in your own eye, China says, before pointing out the beam in ours.Human rights groups have called on the International Criminal Court to investigate allegations of genocide. The ICC declined as Beijing isnrsquot a signatory to the Rome Statute which established the court, and so prosecutors have no jurisdiction over the regime.Where does this leave people of conscience  Our politicians may have sullied themselves with their collusion in the war on terror, or the blind eye they turned to its excesses, but we havenrsquot.Regardless of the moral failures of Western governments, we as citizens can compel our leaders to take action against China.

The vaccine will reduce your risk of getting Covid-. If you do get it again, the vaccine can reduce how serious the symptoms will be.I had the virus in late November. Although I am old , I was fortunate in not suffering unduly. A couple of days feeling ldquounder the weather and food delivered to the door and so on sufficed.But according to information I have looked out, some highly respectable research indicates that I will have acquired an immunity that should last around six months. Furthermore that immunity includes the inability to spread the virus to others, which the vaccination does not. Therefore NHS Scotland, the Scottish Government and Public Health Scotland are colluding in sending out information that is not strictly  but is not strictly accurate either. Yes, I could get it again, but it is highly unlikely within six months, by which time it seems that the effect of the vaccination might have worn off anyhow.I can understand why they would want to send out that message, as the alternative complicates the management of the administration of the vaccine. Easier by far to just jab us all in order.However, according to the figures I looked up today, , people have had and recovered from Covid-. That is potentially , wasted vaccinations. And no one has attempted to clary what is the impact of either of the vaccines on natural immunity.This raises some interesting questions ndash like could the natural immunity provided by Covid- infection take the place of the first injection, and simply be boosted by the second In any case I would much prefer teachers to be given priority for vaccination and let the kids get back some sort of le ndash, vaccines would go some way toward that.Clare Darlaston, Glasgow G.WHEN DO WE GET TO CHOOSE AS the vaccines are rolled out, the death and hospitalisation rates for Covid- will decrease. Despite what the Scottish and UK governments say about statistics not changing until end of March, we will soon see a decrease in these awful numbers. For example, in two to three weeks time, the . million people already vaccinated will be immune. The fundamental issue is who underwrites the risk when the infection rate decreases In the UK, there are , deaths from heart disease each year, and , serious or fatal car accidents, yet inidual rather than state responsibility prevails on preventative measures. What gives the Government the right to endlessly control peoples lives with draconian restrictions, when the risk from Covid- reduces to an acceptable level  I submit that in a free and democratic society, when the risk to society in general becomes less than the risk to the inidual, citizens should have the right to control their own destiny rather than submitting to long-lasting, however well-intentioned, state intervention.Dr Ian Forbes, Glasgow GCONCENTRATE ON THE ROLL-OUTWITH its usual alacrity the Scottish Government has managed to make us just that bit more miserable by its toughening and likely extension of the current lockdown. It may be necessary but that doesnt make it any less depressing.Meanwhile, its distribution of the vaccine seems to be progressing with all the speed and urgency of a somewhat arthritic snail.Would it perhaps be too much to ask that it now concentrates on spending as much,not more, effort and time in rolling out its best hope of restoring our freedoms as it seems to do on the process of removing them Dave Henderson, Glasgow G.THANKS FOR STERLING SERVICETODAYI took my dad to his local village hall for his Covid- vaccination.

My we is a merchandiser who has to go into supermarkets and maintain and replenish stock and has commented many times recently on how much busier the stores are and on the free-for-all in supermarkets where some folk appear to be treating store visits as a three-generation family outing and letting children treat stores as play areas.When she and the store workers are trying to rearrange and replenish stock the phrase ldquoexcuse me is noticeably absent as customers barge into you to get what they want with no thoughts of social distancing whatsoever. Hopefully the new restrictions will help those working in stores to stay safe and reduce possible spread of infections.I often wonder, though: is the definition of ldquoessential goods needing redefined so that some areas of large stores should be closed off  I was recently in a large clothing food store where clothes on the same level as food were for sale but for some strange reason clothes on the upper level were blocked off yet stores selling clothing only are closed. Why Surelya store is open for food and has to restrict upper floor access the same products on lower floors should also be restricted.Dougie Jardine, Bishopbriggs.HELP TEACHERS WHO ARE IN SCHOOLROSEMARY Goring is absolutely correct. Her views can apply also to a further vital group apparently forgotten.Two members of my family are teaching children of frontline workers. If they and others like them did not turn up to educate these children, their parents could no longer work and valuable services, essential to our well-being in the battle against Covid, would cease.Why are these hard-working teachers, in particular as they are in continually open schools, not on any priority vaccination list Patricia Dewar Gibb, Glasgow G.THINK TANK FIGURES DONT ADD UPTHE claim from Gordon Browns think tank Our Scottish Future that Scotlandrsquos Covid- test and protect system is failingis highly questionable. It is certainly not supported by the statistical analyses it published.To assess the performance of the system, you would need to estimate the numbers of infections prevented by isolating infected cases and their close contacts, whether positive or not. This is not what the published estimates purport to do. Instead, they base their calculations on a simplistic assessment of the proportion of prevalent infections identied by tests. This tells us precisely nothing about infections prevented.In fact, the published estimates ndash % for Scotland ndash do not even correctly identy the proportions of infections identied by testing. To obtain these figures, the authors of the report cumulate tests over  days, when in fact the average duration of a Covid- infection is closer to  days, as indicated by ONS incidence and prevalence estimates. This alone produces a large underestimate.However, the underpinning methodology is more fundamentally flawed, as demonstrated by the reportrsquos data for Northern Ireland, which indicates that on some days there were more positive tests than infections. Something is seriously wrong here, and itrsquos most likely not with Scotlandrsquos test and protect system.Paddy Farrington, Emeritus Professor of Statistics at the Open University, Edinburgh EH.Read more: NHS Lothian drops policy blamed for slowing down care home vaccinations"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12225157.jpg?type=article-full","title":"closures-pupil-teacher-absences-covid-impacted-scotlands-schools","story":"The information showsstudent and staff attendance and absences, what reasons were provided for absences,the percentage attendance of pupilsat each level of education from Primary  to S and the percentage of childcare services open in Scotland.Since schools started to reopen on August , , data has been collected on pupil attendance and absence, staff absence and schools closed due to coronavirus.This shows key trends in how the virus has taken its toll on our education system and how it has been affected at each stage.For example, the data shows that. per centof pupils did notattendschool on December , and .%stated Covid- related reasons for this.Secondary school students were the worst impacted, with data showing that only .% of S pupils attended school on December .Information was also gathered from % of all childcare services,which includes data on attendance, absences and services forced to close from Covid-.Here are  charts which show how Covid- impacted Scotlands schoolsWhat do you think         name : ballot,target: ballot_,params:.push"},{"url":null,"title":"bbc-question-time-tonight","story":"Tonight will see a wide range of MPs and representatives from across the nation appear on the show on BBC One.We take a look at who is on the  tonight and what viewers can expect.Vicky Ford - Conservative,Minister for Children and FamiliesThe Government representative on the show tonight will be Vicky Ford, the Minister for Children and Families.

For example, I believe that tax haven loopholes must be closed. I believe that we should have a second governing chamber which is elected.It is the responsibility of our elected representatives to govern for the benefit of every citizen, not just the rich and powerful.The people who take part in Citizens Assemblies should be given expenses to cover any loss they might experience I do not believe they should be paid a salary.

He asked Ms Forbes to clary whether or not island councils will be free to use the top up funding to support any businesses, including accommodation providers, to provide parity with support available in the rest of the country.In response, Ms Forbes confirmed that the #top up# announced by the First Minister would ensure businesses in island communities receive the same support, on the same level, as those in Level Four areas.Afterwards, Mr McArthur said: “While the announcement earlier this week of a ‘top up’ fund for island authorities was welcome, it soon became apparent that many businesses, including accommodation providers, were at risk of being excluded.“That was unacceptable and out of step with the assurances I received from the Finance Secretary last week. I’m pleased Kate Forbes has now set the record straight in a response to me at Finance Questions by confirming that island businesses will have access to the same ongoing funding as those in Level Four areas.“This support may be delivered through a Discretionary Fund rather than the Strategic Framework Business Fund, but Ms Forbes could not have been clearer that the effect should be the same.“Hopefully, Orkney Islands Council is now able to put a process in place to allow businesses to begin applying for the support they so desperately need.#He added: “The Finance Secretary also helpfully claried that the ‘top up’ support is over and above what can be accessed through the sector-specic funds, announced at the end of last year.“Details for most of the sector specic funds have not yet been published, but are expected later this month.

This comes on top of £m already committed for education recovery since the start of the pandemic, bringing the total additional support provided to more than £ million since the start of the pandemic.#I appreciate only too well the additional burden home learning is placing on many of our children and their families,# Mr Swinney said.#After the last period of school building closures we commissioned an Equity Audit, published today, to better understand the impact on children’s learning and health and wellbeing, particularly disadvantaged pupils.“Since the start of the pandemic our funding has led to an additional , teachers and over  support staff being appointed. The new funding can be used to recruit further staff # which might include teachers, classroom assistants, administrative staff, home school link workers or other support workers — as well as the resources that families and schools need to support home learning, including additional digital devices where there is any remaining unmet need, and other home learning resources.#Mr Swinney has also asked HM Inspectors of Education to commence with a national review of the quality and effectiveness of remote learning across the country with the first report published next Friday, January .He said: “The quality and effectiveness of remote learning across the country will be reviewed by HM Inspectors of Education. A programme of ‘national overviews’, will commence immediately and last for the duration of remote learning.##These will seek to identy what is working well and where further improvement is required. These overviews will be published weekly to ensure they are available for everyone to learn and build from, starting week ending  January.#Private and third sector day care of children settings are also set to receive almost £ million in temporary financial support.The education secretary added: “I am aware that remaining open for very small numbers of children creates pressure for some childcare providers, and I can therefore confirm we will make temporary financial support of up to £. million available for each four week period of restrictions to day care of children providers and childminding settings caring for  or more children who remain open for vulnerable and keyworker children during these restrictions.#We will confirm details as soon as possible.“If the evidence tells us we can get some pupils back safely, we will do that, and we will ensure the package of mitigations in schools remains robust and tailored to the circumstances we face.

Vaccines offer us hope and a way out but, until then, we must all play our part in together beating the virus. We look at the many ways we can continue to stay at home and enjoy le.There are things we can all do to look after our mental wellbeing at this time. The Clear Your Head website has some great tips to help you feel calmer, create a routine, keep active, look after yourself and support each other. For more information go to gov.scot coronavirus vw, px\"  As COVID- tightens its grip, lockdown restrictions have again been put in place, and are likely to remain for some time to come. Schools to shops, work to pubs, restaurants, cinemas and gyms – all aspects of our lives are affected amid the UK Government and Devolved Administrations’ clear, clarion calls to stay at home. Those on the NHS frontline continue to bear the brunt of the pandemic while other key workers are keeping operating essential services such as supermarkets, pharmacies, waste collection and deliveries.We can all play our part on the path to freedom. All we have to do is obey the rules. Le in lockdown is undoubtedly dferent. But, embrace it, and it can offer new opportunities. Take up a hobby, learn a skill, exercise, read, bake, take up a craft and complete jobs around the house you have been putting off. New technologies allow us to keep in touch with family and friends as well as connecting on virtual pub quizzes and classes. There is light at the end of the tunnel with rules regularly reviewed and the vaccination programme being rolled out apace. But for now we are in this together, all having a vital part to play. vw, px\"  Husband and we Tim and Angela Hoehave embraced le in lockdown.The Yorkshire couple has exercised more, completed DIY jobs around the house and garden and become well-read.“All our shopping is supermarket click-and-collect or from our local independents and farm shop.”They have two adult children. Daughter Charlotte lives with her partner nearby while son Lewis lives with his we Lucy and two children Harry, aged six, and Lily,  months, in Bournemouth. Angela has not seen them or her parents, who also live in Yorkshire, for ten months.The couple love to exercise and have continued to do so within updated rules.“With gyms closing, it was a case of keeping ourselves fit with running, biking and YouTube yoga and fitness classes online. Reading and crosswords have also filled our days,” confirmed Angela. “The mobile library has provided a fantastic service allowing us to choose and order books online and collect locally. Danielle Steel has been a particular favourite for me while my husband has continued with his love of Dickens, Steinbeck and Hemingway.”Despite not visiting family, they have kept in touch. “FaceTime calling has become a regular occurrence with calls to our grandchildren and listening to our grandson read stories from his school book.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This aimed to allow a quick ruling which could act as guidance to other insurers and other policies on whether they should pay out.ndash What kind of policies did businesses have Before the pandemic, many businesses only had insurance covering direct damage to their property.However some had policies designed to pay outtheir business was interrupted by disease, and others had paid for policies that would activateaccess to their business was prevented by a public authority, orthey were ordered to close.There were many dferent policies, but the ones tested by the courts included some of the most common wording.ndash Why were insurers not paying out The insurance companies had several arguments why they should not have to pay. Some said their business interruption clauses were only activateda local disease caused a business to suffer. Because the coronavirus lockdown was nationally mandated, insurers argued they did not have to pay out.Other arguments hinged on a precedent set in a  High Court case which found that an insurer did not have to pay out business interruption insurance to a New Orleans hotel after hurricanes Katrina and Rita.The insurer only had to compensate the hotel for direct damage the hurricane caused, and argued that the hotelrsquos business would have been interrupted whether or not it was directly damaged, so only paid out part of the insurance.ndash What happens next The case was never meant to iron out all dficulties, just to get clarity on some common issues that many policyholders were running into when trying to get a payout.ldquoTodayrsquos judgment does not determine how much is payable under inidual policies, but provides much of the basis for doing so, the FCA said.Insurers decided to pay out claims on some policies after an earlier High Court ruling on the issue. They had also been asked by the FCA to progress some applications so they were ready to be settled rapidly when the Supreme Court ruled.Policyholders who are affected can expect to hear from their insurer soon, the FCA said, and should approach their advisers or insurers with any questions.The FCA has already published draft guidance on how a business can prove Covid- was present in their local area, which is required for some policies.Comments are closed on this article.copy -.

As ordinary folk, none of these three ‘coves’ come with the egotism associatedwith this level of stardom. Their down-to-earth attitude, gentle humility and self-confessed naivety of the wider music industry is part of their unique charm and connects them to their fans across the generations who reward them with unwavering loyalty.“The Barrowlands was booked but that sold out just as quickly. Suddenly all the venues sold out, including gigs in London and Manchester. It was unbelievable.”“We are not the type of band that can sit down and invent new materials,” said Innes.“Everything comes out of Boydie’s head and, until it’s ready to be released, it’s not coming. You don’t ask him to do anything. He has a heart of gold and means well to everyone but,you ask him to do something, and he’s not ready for, it will not get done. We are waiting to see what happens with live gigs next year.”Innes confesses to feeling nervous about the uncertainty of the future of live performances. He said: “Over the summer, a lot of people believed the situation with the pandemic would be better but I realised things were getting worse for live music. I really wondered whether Peat  Diesel would ever play live again.“I am, however, a positive person who always sees good things in bad situations. Watching pre-Covid TV programmes where people are sitting closely together does put fear through us though. Until maybe everyone takes this vaccine and Covid goes away, I think live music is really going to struggle.“When we are playing, the crowd sucks up the atmosphere we have created.“If that atmosphere is not there, I don’t think people will enjoy it. For the  tour, I am not sure whether people will be ready to gather or whether they would rather wait that extra while to attend a gig. We will have to wait and see how it goes.”The  tour has been rescheduled for next year, with a gig booked for Skye in the autumn.Innes says he is looking forward to coming back to Skye: “We have played on Skye before and were not sure how they would get us. It was an amazing experience for us, though, as people sang along to the words and really enjoyed the performance.“Despite the sea between us, Skye people are very like us and understand our music.“We decided the tour had to include a venue on Skye as we feel they are our friends and family and a place where we feel at home to be ourselves and enjoy our time there.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/XMAS-HAMPERS-PORTREE-1-scaled.jpg","title":"skye community response well","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSCR chair Ross Cowie

aiming to make a clean sweep across","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineSkye Lockdown Litterpick was set up to encourage people to clean up their local area during the tier  lockdown from Christmas into the New Year, and to date more than  people have become members of the Facebook group.With the conditions of lockdown now tightened until at least the end of January, Dunvegan resident Jennie Chapman, who set up the group, believes that the virtual community of litter pickers is empowering people on Skye to do their bit inidually for a collective cause.: “The Facebook group provides a virtual community where anyone living on Skye can get involved in picking up litter in their local area during this — now extended — lockdown period.“We will then collate all the information about quantities collected and map the areas covered so that we can see an ever growing picture of community involvement in making the island cleaner.“You will see, on the page announcements, a map that is updated every couple of days at least.” Commenting on the response to the group, she said: “At the time of writing there are  members of the group.“Many of these are people who I am sure have been concerned about this issue for some time and may well have already been regularly picking up litter on walks.“However, it can feel like a bit of an uphill battle when you do it on your own so this virtual community is so encouraging when you begin to see how many others care and are also wanting to do their part.”Highlighting the scope of the problem, she added: “We are certainly finding that across the island some of the worst spots for littering include along road verges, especially on the larger roads, around parking areas and lay bys and in popular walking spots.“The range of things that we are collecting includes absolutely huge numbers of drinks bottles, cans, coffee cups and snack wrappers — especially those thrown from car windows along verges — and random items such as huge builders bags, car exhaust pipes and even dirty nappies and used condoms.”Addressing the tightened restrictions now in place, Jennie said: “Everyone taking part is doing so either on their own or in accordance with all now further tightened legal requirements for meeting outside — so from now that will be only with one other person at most and remaining at full social distance.“We have found that two people working to collect from either side of a road verge works well.“All collections are then reported into the group on Facebook for mapping.“At the time of writing we have so far logged  large bin bags full of rubbish being removed from  dferent locations around the island as well as at least  large objects – and we have at least all of January to go!“You will see from the map that the project has now spread to all four corners of the island.”While Jennie acknowledges that the group itself is not a stand-alone solution to the issue, she does hope that it might have a positive effect and persuade people to think twice about littering.She said: “Although this is a short-term project the longer-term issue is unlikely to go away anytime soon so we hope that at least the project raises awareness of the issue.“And maybe it will encourage some people to take their rubbish home rather than littering the countryside and encourages everyone who takes part in trying to keep their local area clean.“There are lots of us out there and we are all part of a bigger picture.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3584276.jpg--.jpg?1610715452000\n","title":"chief medical officers urge everyone to stay home","story":"Chief

However, people from the RoI Revenue are saying something dferent at the moment.We are trying to work it out as we speak. Earlier this week local dealers learned with relief that they will avoid having to pay % Vat on the value of used vehicles imported from Britain under the Brexit protocol.Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said the Government would instead reinstate Vat on profits, saving dealers thousands of pounds.Cars bought new here, then sold second-hand in the Republic, will face Vehicle Registration Taxand NOx emission costs already in place, but nothing extra.However,a dealer from the Republic travels to Britain, buys a car second-hand and brings it back, a % tarf and % customs fee will be added to the cost.The potential advantage for local used car dealers over those based in the rest of the UK is clearthey can sell cars on in the Republic.Dealers are trying to clary whether they are able to buy in Britain, bring the vehicle over, then sell across the border without incurring the extra cost.There is a brisk trade between Britain and the Republic, but that is going to be disrupted, said Mr Hetherington.For buyers of used cars in the south, the net effect will be higher prices and less choice in used cars as a current source of supply is being cut off, he added.Representatives were told by the Republic#s Revenue officials that it is all based on rules of origin - thatthe vehicle is manufactured in, or has passed through Britain, then it will be subject to the increased cost, Mr Hetherington said.But the Withdrawal Agreement wording suggests to him we can bring them through Northern Ireland without facing tarfs and customs costs.He added there is the possibility the Republic#s tax collectors could face a legal challengethey do impose the charges.Meanwhile, Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy has welcomed confirmation that used cars imported from Britain and sold to businesses and consumers here will not incur the higher Vat charges.This additional % would have crippled many businesses in the North, resulted in the loss of jobs and resulted in families paying extra money for cars, the Mid Ulster MP said.DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has already welcomed the move, saying the protocol was on the verge of destroying practically every second-hand car business in Northern Ireland.Belfast Related ContentNorthern Ireland PremiumNorthern Ireland produce can feed  million, Poots told after his #no food# warningsNorthern Ireland produces enough to feed its entire population five times over, a supplier has said after a Stormont minister claimed hospitals and schools faced the prospect of being unable to feed patients and children.Northern IrelandUncertainty for NI#s steel industry as #surprise# % tarf to be imposed on non-GB importsThe steel sector in Northern Ireland is confused and uncertain after it emerged a surprise % tarf will be imposed on imports not from Great Britain.Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Executive introduces pre-departure testing for international arrivals as  further deaths reportedBlaze at Belfast Multi-Cultural Association building a #devastating blow# for its volunteers, says Lord Mayor Frank McCoubreyWitness to assault that resulted in death of Darren O#Neill at Tyrella beach breaks down giving evidence Three people taken to hospital after car plunges into Strangford LoughNorthern Ireland likely to miss #Beast from the East# next week, says Met OfficeLatest BrexitWe have given blood for Union: Paisley launches scathing attack on Boris Johnson over post-Brexit supply issuesUncertainty for NI#s steel industry as #surprise# % tarf to be imposed on non-GB importsNorthern Ireland produce can feed  million, Poots told after his #no food# warningsProtocol promise: PM in vow to trigger Article trading dficulties worsenLatest from Belfast Bangor UDA man jailed for running #signicant# drug dealing operation in North DownWayne Rooney’s playing career in numbersJoint stay-at-home plea over ‘unsustainably high level’ of CovidLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp insists he has ‘no skills for playing mind games’Wayne Rooney ends playing career and becomes full-time Derby manager,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It#s a while ago now, but, as a student of English, one of the books we all had to study was Animal Farm.And one line has always stood out - All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.It#s a phrase that has been transferred to so many walks of le since George Orwell penned it on August , .The transfer test, the old -plus exam, was born just two years later. It stood the test of time, until time caught up.Of course no one wants to limit any parent#s choice in what school to send their child to. But are parents the best people to choose  We all fall into the mode of pushing our children to be the best that they can be and there#s nothing wrong with that.Time has allowed those using the system to work the system, find shortcuts, workarounds, make the system work for them.The academic selection of children aged - has had a business built around it.For a business to work, you need capital funds. Not everyone has those funds.You wonder just how many children went to a dferent school because someone , who might not have started out as academically proficient, overtook them through intense, specialised tutoring, paid for by parents who could afford it, taught by former teachers who knew the tricks of the trade.And there emerged a new breed of parents.In counselling terms, they are referred to as #helicopter parents#. They hover over their child#s every move, dissect work in microscopic details.Ask any counsellor working in the school environment and they will tell you the pressure to succeed has never been greater, and it is having a detrimental effect on the mental health of so many pupils. They are left with little room to breathe, strangled by these new #Tiger parents# - a phrase coined in  in a Yale University study of academic achievement, using all means possible to ensure the future success of a child.Earlier this week, before AQE finally pulled out of holding a single transfer test, Stranmillis University published research into the inequalities of the education system. These are the educators, turning the spotlight on the profession they have excelled in. They warned of the widening #lockdown learning gap#. Those who have, swim, those who haven#t start to drown. The educational waters have been stirred and the ship is listing.I#m reminded of another book, Robinson Crusoe. Shipwrecked on a desert island he had to learn a new way of living. Time is fast approaching where the whole education system needs a similar restructuring.There will always be a place for grammar schools. Some pupils naturally thrive in that environment, but they should not be pushed into it aged . It has to be the right thing for them, not for their social status in adulthood. Teachers should know the academic merits of their pupils. Intensive tutoring for a transfer test shouldn#t bypass that. With the AQE washing hands of any involvement in the transfer of pupils this year, it#s been left up to the schools themselves to chart a course through the waves. There are many rocks lurking under the surface, no less in the form of legalities.All post-primaries were to submit their admissions criteria to the Education Authority by today but following the AQE#s move that has been extended until Friday, January .It is not a lot of time to get things right, close all exploitable loopholes and take a steamroller to level that playing field cut up further by a turbulent winter - which is why this process should have been planned for before we got to this stage.And though the utopia of #all schools are equal# may never be reached, surely now is the window of opportunity to make sure that all schools are a little less more equal than others Belfast Related ContentGalleryEducationPeter Weir#s #clumsy# tweet slammed by heads of NI secondary schoolsSecondary school principals in Northern Ireland have slammed the Education Minister for implying they provide a second class option for pupils.Education PremiumTim CairnsOpinionExecutive didn#t have courage to lead and have failed the class of Everyone in Northern Ireland has a transfer test story to share.

Happy birthday mum.”So lucky to be in this position â¤ï¸ Happy birthday mum 🎉🚗 pic AiRrYYcV— Adam BJanuary , Adam, who has more than three million subscribers to his YouTube channel, landed a presenter’s post with Blue Peter last year.Purchasing his mum a new car is the not the first time Adam has shared expensive gts.In December, he surprised -year-old Stewart O’Doherty after finding out he was being bullied in school.After reading a tweet from Stewart’s sister Molly about his ordeal, Adam bought Stewart £, worth of birthday gts to help him in his YouTube career.It was a moment caught on video which the internet star plans to use as part of an anti-bullying campaign.Stewart was stunned when Adam turned up at his Londonderry home with a laptop, cameras, microphones, speakers, GoPros and numerous other gadgets to help him start out.Talking about his own and Stewart#s experience of bullying he said at the time: Stewart should be proud of himself for doing something dferent and escaping that #small town# mentality of being ridiculed for doing something dferent.It angers me so much that bullying is still happening. I started doing YouTube in  periodically until  when I devoted a lot of my time to it.Being in an all-boy school, back when there were no big Northern Irish YouTubers to look up to - it was very dficult to stay on that path.It was dficult to keep believing when everyone  was slagging you off, making fun, calling you names as you walked past them in school corridors. It was horrible and I wish it on no one.Stewart#s case hit a nerve. I know exactly what he is going through. Being from the same town, same school and even having the same passion, I can fully relate to Stewart#s situation.I was very close to giving up so many times when I was at school. Being told by both pupils and even teachers to stop YouTube - it was a very stressful environment.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Executive introduces pre-departure testing for international arrivals as  further deaths reportedBlaze at Belfast Multi-Cultural Association building a #devastating blow# for its volunteers, says Lord Mayor Frank McCoubreyThree people taken to hospital after car plunges into Strangford LoughWitness to assault that resulted in death of Darren O#Neill at Tyrella beach breaks down giving evidence Northern Ireland likely to miss #Beast from the East# next week, says Met OfficeLatest Northern IrelandBangor UDA man jailed for running #signicant# drug dealing operation in North DownJoint stay-at-home plea over ‘unsustainably high level’ of CovidSupreme Court insurance claim ruling #welcome relief# for small businesses, says Hospitality UlsterBelfast republican secures High Court permission to challenge police decision to question him at airportLatest from Belfast Rejection of Covid jab by ethnic minorities ‘could fan flames of Islamophobia’Uganda’s opposition candidate says military has entered his homeScottish Health Secretary apologises for publishing ‘sensitive’ vaccine detailsDutch PM and Cabinet quit over child welfare payments scandalPolice hunt after man tries to snatch five-year-old boy from park,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But negotiators did not include NI in the quota arrangement, according to market watchers.Analysts Argus flagged up the extra charge after a briefing by UK customs and HMRC. Traders were informed in a conference call with government agencies.The duty has been imposed without warning, Argus said in a briefing paper.Following Brexit, the UK has its own quarterly steel safeguard for January-June , mirroring the European system, the company said.The quota started on  January, after the end of the Brexit transition period. Northern Ireland is not included in the quota, but all steel - unless it originates in the UK - will still incur % safeguard duties. Seamus Murchan, co-owner of Lambeg-based KME Steelworks, said his firm attempted to secure as much product as possible ahead of the end of the transition period, because of the uncertainty.But when we went to our main suppliers, reliable and of quality, we found the supply was limited, said Mr Murchan, whose company sources from suppliers where in the UK so will be affected by the % tarf.It has been no better since the start of the year and still waiting on some.Mr Murchan said the firm, which designs and manufactures steel moulds for the construction and agriculture sector among other products, said customers are aware of the global price issues, but the company has tried to hold off increases as long as possible.He warned that there will be price hikes in the near future.The safeguard refers to protecting European steel from US imports, in place for several years.At least one trader has already been charged % duty for material that cleared into the Republic of Ireland, while others have been sending steel into Northern Ireland without realising they would have to make such a payment, the analysts reported.This highlights the uncertainty and confusion surrounding steel sold into Northern Ireland that does not originate in Great Britain.Belfast Related ContentNorthern Ireland PremiumNorthern Ireland produce can feed  million, Poots told after his #no food# warningsNorthern Ireland produces enough to feed its entire population five times over, a supplier has said after a Stormont minister claimed hospitals and schools faced the prospect of being unable to feed patients and children.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph business uk-world a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cab-f-f-aa-bacff_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph business uk-world a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cab-f-f-aa-bacff_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph business uk-world a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cab-f-f-aa-bacff_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph business uk-world a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cab-f-f-aa-bacff_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph business uk-world a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cab-f-f-aa-bacff_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"UK and WorldCost a Lidl less: Lidl narrowly beats Aldi to be named cheapest supermarket Lidl has narrowly beaten Aldi to be named the cheapest supermarket of , according to Which  analysis.Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Executive introduces pre-departure testing for international arrivals as  further deaths reportedBlaze at Belfast Multi-Cultural Association building a #devastating blow# for its volunteers, says Lord Mayor Frank McCoubreyThree people taken to hospital after car plunges into Strangford LoughWitness to assault that resulted in death of Darren O#Neill at Tyrella beach breaks down giving evidence Northern Ireland likely to miss #Beast from the East# next week, says Met OfficeLatest Northern IrelandJoint stay-at-home plea over ‘unsustainably high level’ of CovidSupreme Court insurance claim ruling #welcome relief# for small businesses, says Hospitality UlsterBelfast republican secures High Court permission to challenge police decision to question him at airportPartnership between UK defence firm and India could boost Belfast plantSentence increased for dissident republican convicted of police murder bidLatest from Belfast Joint stay-at-home plea over ‘unsustainably high level’ of CovidLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp insists he has ‘no skills for playing mind games’Wayne Rooney ends playing career and becomes full-time Derby managerIn Pictures: Wintry weather brings floods and snowAnita Rani welcomes listeners to ‘new-look’ Friday Woman’s Hour,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Glenullin man looked back on the special year. Michael McMullan writes... *** Its the Friday before the  All-Ireland minor final and Gerard OKane waits impatiently for the final bell in St Patricks College Maghera. Like a child on Christmas Eve. As the clock drags its way towards four oclock, ious teachers drop by to wish him luck on the Everest of Sundays in Irelands sporting calendar. A genuine warmth, willing him to bring back the silverware. Exactly  months earlier, OKane was a spectator in Croke Park as the Tyrone minor team that handed Derry a - to - hammering earlier in the summer were held by Dublin. The Red Hands won the replay by  points, a side that produced eight All-Ireland senior winners, including Sean Cavanagh, Joe McMahon and Martin Penrose, who OKane marked. googletag.cmd.push When the next season swung into action, Tyrone ran Derry to a point in the Ulster Final. It was the closest anyone came, as Derrys unstoppable force romped to the All-Ireland with an average winning margin of  points across their six-game odyssey. It was the first year of the back door and it included a -point mauling of Munster finalists Tipperary in the All-Ireland Quarter-Final. OKane remembers a message from Dermot McNicholl, his club mate and fellow All-Ireland winning captain. “He called to the house around that time and was just saying we had to beat what was in front of us,” OKane states. googletag.cmd.push One of the final knocks on OKanes classroom door on that everlasting Friday afternoon was from McNicholl. Standing outside in the corridor, the message was two-fold. First, came the wish of good luck. It was followed by a word of advice. In , McNicholl was left all alone in the Hogan Stand presentation area while the rest of the squad danced a jig of delight on Croke Parks hallowed turf. “If you are lucky enough to win,” was the theme of McNicholls warning. “There will be a guy come on the pitch and his job is to get the winning captain for the presentation of the cup....dont go to him.”     The man was head Croke Park steward John Leonard and as result, McNicholl missed the two minutes of joy with his team mates. “I was conscious of that,” OKane now knew. “The fella wouldve been just looking for the Derry number three.” Thankfully for OKane and Derry, the prophecy came to pass. He got offside long enough to embrace manager Chris Brown and his father Gerard – then the County Chairman – before bouncing around Croke Park with the squad. The bliss of success. “There is usually a rush to get the minor teams off the field,” OKane says. “But it didnt seem to be like that for us. We had half an hour after the final whistle. We had that time to spend with ourselves and do a lap of honour.” They soaked up every lasting memory of an afternoon that saw Armagh wrestle their way past Kerry in an epic encounter to win their first senior title. The following afternoon, the teams victory cavalcades would coincide at the Carrickdale, among thongs of fans and the sirens of the Garda escort, as both cups passed into the six counties, in the same year, for the first time. “Both teams were in big Chambers buses and when we arrived the Armagh people thought we were the Armagh team,” OKane recalls. Both Kieran McGeeney and OKane, with the respective cups, flanked by owner hotel John McParland, a huge GAA man, they exited through a fire escape and onto a flat roof above the fans outside. A moment to remember. “There were literally thousands upon thousands of people,” OKane adds. It was a moment worth waiting for. *** The unique aspect of that minor team was the spread of clubs. OKane and goalkeeper Eoin McNicholl hailed from Glenullin, but the rest were from across the county. “The  outfield players were from dferent clubs, so we had a better balance,” said OKane. Paul Young was the only survivor from the  Ulster winning team. OKane was one of a handful on the  squad. The rest were assembled by Chris Brown and his management team of Paddy Crozier, Charlie OKane, Bernie Henry and the late Aidan OBrien. In February, St Patricks Maghera exited the MacRory Cup and  players were called up for county duty, as Derry began their assault on Ulster. Mickey Drumm, as OKane recalls, was very unlucky, having dislocated his shoulder and missed out. It was never said, but the group knew they had the tools to give Ulster a shake. The management kept their powder dry and the squad grounded. After a convincing - to - win over Antrim in Casement Park, thanks to - from Barry McGoldrick and a Ciaran Mullan goal, they were up against Cavan who were hotly tipped after a seven-point victory over Down. Ciaran Mullan in action against Joe Ball of Tyrone in the Ulster final  “Cavan had a strong team, with Seanie Johnson, Mark McKeever, Anthony Gaynor, Paddy Brady and Sean Brady,” rolled the litany of names effortlessly off OKanes tongue. It was the first season of the back door. Getting to a provincial final offered a safety net, guaranteeing a passage into the All-Ireland series. “I remember Paddy and Chris saying to me,we got over this game we wouldnt be far away from the All-Ireland. “Cavan was a tough one, even though we only beat Tyrone by a point in the final,” Gerard offers. It was a standalone tie on a Saturday evening in Enniskillen, due to GAAs accommodation of the Leaving Cert examinations. In a tight encounter, Derry pulled away and ran out four-point winners, - to -. It was their passport to the summer. Waiting in the final was a Tyrone team Derry had beaten in a challenge match in the lull before their Cavan showdown. “They knew us inside out,” OKane states. It was a game Derry looked like leaving behind them, with Tyrone five points ahead entering the final  minutes. “We looked dead and buried, we didnt play well, but something just clicked. We clawed back one or two points,” said OKane. Aaron Cassidy came of the bench to kick a beauty, one of the six unanswered points as Derry clawed to victory, - to -. There was another moment, the key one. Seated in the dugout, beside Gerard senior, was Derry selector, the Aidan OBrien. “One of the points came after a turnover by Paul Young. He made a block on their full-back on his way out and won a free,” states Gerard junior. “It wouldnt have been Pauls style and Aidan turned to Daddy and said we were going to win it... that was the turning point. We were probably the better team, but didnt show it in the first  minutes.” By the time the giddy Derry squad filed out of the minor dressing rooms in Clones, the senior decider was under way and Armagh had the ball in the back of the net after an early error by Donegal goalkeeper Tony Blake. The Derry players took up their seats and watched Joe Kernans Armagh team of gladiators pick up the Anglo Celt Cup, a group that became the main billing ahead of Derry in Croker later in the summer. Before celebrating with the team, later that night in Magheras Walshs Hotel, it was back home to Glenullin for OKane. “My father was heavily involved and our house was a ceili house anyway,” Gerard states. “I can remember Danny McNicholl was there...and a few others waiting on me and the cup was there.” For now, it was time to swap the tracksuit for the disco clothes and meet with the squad in Maghera. On the way home from Walshs Hotel, in the wee small hours, there was a stop off in Slaughtneil to finish off the celebrations. “Id say, and Im not exaggerating,  of us stayed in Patsy Bradleys house that night,” he laughs. “They have a third or fourth floor and his mother had blankets for us. I remember Mickeyand three or four aul hands sitting around the kitchen table.” Derrys battles for supremacy were over, but they only just getting into their stride. It was time for their All-Ireland victory procession. *** Tipperary were the first victims of that Derry machine in a - to - hammering in Navan, with Paul Young hitting -. Longford beat Meath in the Leinster Final, with - from dangerman Michael Hussey who was the championship top scorer that year, with a tally of -. He got no change from Michael McGoldrick in defence, as Derry ran out winners by another big margin, - to -. “It left us feeling a bit undercooked going into the final, but minor football is a bit like that where you can build up big scores on a team,” said OKane “We were still quietly confident thatLongford could beat Meath and we beat Longford by the margin we did, we would give Meath a game.” Eoin McNicholl celebrates the semi-final win over Longford  The Royals were a more imposing team. None more so than at full forward, where OKane was tasked with marking man mountain Joe Sheridan. “I was ” and luckyI was ten stone and he was built like a man. Theyd a couple of boys at midfield who were the same and a strong half back line,” OKane adds. “Maybe the wide open spaces suited us, we were full of footballers and had a lot of speed on our team.” Time and time again, OKane would play in front and cut off the supply. It wasnt a tactic of the management. It was OKanes natural game and he had the experience of playing there for Glenullin seniors who reached the last four of the championship that season. Earlier in the year he played at centre back in the MacRory Cup, in front of full-back Mark Lynch. When Conleth Moran came back to fitness after the Ulster championship, he forced his way back into the attack for the All-Ireland campaign. The unlucky man to lose out was Glenullin man Neal Mullan. “I think theywere toying with the idea of putting Mark to full-back, but I was playing well there,so they let it be and put Mark at six.” Ciaran McCallion moved from centre back to the wing and Derrys formula was complete. As with any final, comes the sideshow of free gloves and boots, getting measured up for suits and the arrangements for the banquet. In the background, Paddy Croziers eye for detail picked up a distraction seeping into the squad. On the Monday before the final, he called the captain to one side. It was time for a quiet word, one that would have a greater impactit didnt come from the management. Another small detail in their quest for glory. “In some ways it was a bit manufactured,” OKane admits. The squad headed to a corner of Owenbeg. “We went and did our own stretching. We said we could buy all the tracksuits and suits, but you cant buy a medal. Is it about a night out in Dublin, or going down to win an All-Ireland  It meant more coming from us than the management.” All the pieces were in place as the squad departed for their Burlington Hotel base on Saturday afternoon. It was packed with people and a strange change from their semi-final base out in Portmarnock. Any background noise didnt filter into a group on a mission. A goal from Ruairi Convery put Derry into a position of strength and with Sheridan starved of possession, Meath moved him outfield to get him into the game. It was a mark of Derrys defence and in particular their full-back line of OKane, Michael McGoldrick and Joe Keenan, who didnt concede a score from play on their way to the final. “I sort of let the side down,” Gerard jokes about the final. “I conceded a point of Brian Farrell, who was moved across to me when they took Sheridan out.” By that stage, Derry had one hand and four fingers of the other on the Tom Markham Cup. Title number four was in the bag. “I remember standing with my back to the Hill in the second half and I could hear people I knew shouting behind me,” said OKane. “We were comfortable in the last five or ten minutes, you were able to take in the atmosphere rather than being in the zone all the time.” Referee Michael Ryans final whistle made it official. Derry were champions and Gerard remembered to escape the clutches of John Leonard. It was celebration time. The Derry players celebrate victory over Meath in the All-Ireland Final  Back at the Burlington, the staff had a guard of honour in place and upstairs, their suits were all laid out for the banquet. After leaving the Carrickdale on the Monday evening, the squad were ferried up a packed Maghera street on an open top bus. A tradition that began with the  minors. At Glen club, Gerard senior took the microphone to introduce the entire  and management. A homecoming befitting of All-Ireland champions. The following night, the cup was taken back to Derry City, before ing to Glenullin, the first club to host the squad. It was the start of a whistle-stop tour of every club in the county. “We did every club in the county for the next four or five nights,” Gerard adds. “Wed get on the bus in Dungiven around half four or five oclock and wouldnt be back til around . Looking back on it now, it was a bit mad with boys having to go back to school.” It was striking while the iron was hot and inspiring the next generation of players. The Derry squad joined Armagh for a civic reception at Stormont. John Dallat took the young Oakleafers on a tour of the building. “I remember meeting Mark Durkan at the banquet in Dublin, and these were boys you saw on TV,” OKane adds. “The week before the final, MrsOHagan handed me a letter in class, addressed to me at the school from Martin McGuinness who was the Minister for Education at the time. “I have pulled out that letter and have got it framed during lockdown, as well as the photos and all the jersies. Im thinking how lucky I was. I have great experiences out of it and made great friends out of it...you instantly click with them straight away.” A team that swatted all in its path to an All-Ireland title.

In an feature interview in this weeks County Derry Post, the Glenullin man – who also captained St Patricks Maghera to MacRory and Hogan Cup glory – looks back on  and the countys last of their four All-Ireland minor wins. OKane made his debut, under Mickey Moran, in a NFL league clash with Waterford at Ballinascreen in , with his first championship coming later in the season against Wicklow in Round  of the qualiers as Derry went all the way to the All-Ireland semi-final where they lost to eventual champions Kerry. googletag.cmd.push His last outing was a substitute appearance, replacing Kevin Johnston, in Derrys  Ulster SFC defeat to Tyrone at Celtic Park under Damian Barton. “All our boyswere playing club senior football,” OKane points out. “I got called into the squad towards the end of  and I still had a year of school to do at that stage. It didnt suit and I remember Dublin ending Derrys summer down in Clones. “I remember Mickey and Harry Joecalling me in for a ween of training games and with my A-Levels, it just didnt suit. “I came in the following year and I was still only , but by that time I had three years of senior club championship football, at first isionduring my minor days.” googletag.cmd.push In OKanes opinion, it prepared him for a -year career at inter-county senior level. He feels that some players are coming onto the inter-county senior scene with no club senior championship football. “I think you need that two or three years playing senior club football,” he states. “Nowadays their senior club career only begins at  or  andyou give them two or three years it would mean they are not ready for county senior until they are  or , then so be it.” After Derrys  All-Ireland success, it took  years for the county to win an Ulster minor title. Conor Glass was the next winning captain and OKane feels he needs to be given time to grow into round ball game after five seasons with Hawthorn and that a lot of pressure has being put on the Glen mans shoulders.     “He needs to find his feet in thatenvironment. I had three years behind me. I remember marking Paul Young, Enda Gormley and Glenullin beat Bellaghy. I was marking Joe Cassidy, who was a Derry senior at that time,” OKane points out. OKane was joint captain of QUBs Sigerson winning team of  and coaches the university Freshers team, another avenue he said also helps players develop. “I know fellas are being plucked from minor squads into senior squads as a development pathway, but there is no better pathway than playing club senior football regularly. “You have to impress at club senior level, before you play county and I dont know that it is happening at the minute.” OKane continued by saying that while it might sound harsh, players are being picked because so much time has been invested in them through development squads. “The same boys might not play senior football for their club regularly, yet they are in and around a county senior squad. “If you take an American tourist, its quite simplistic, and took them a club senior game in Derry and ask him to pick out the county senior players, he should be able to do it.” On the night OKane and his teammates took the Tom Markham Cup back to Maghera in , he made a grand statement that a senior title would follow in six or seven years. “I remember standing in Maghera – and I cringe looking back on it,” he recalls. “It just wasnt going to happen like that. I didnt know that as a  year-old, but once I stepped into the environment I realised its not that easy.” The former Derry defender does see the countys stock rising. In his role with Queens he has been taking a wide look across underage in Ulster in recent time. “Now one of the first questions I am always asking is what is Derry like this year ” he admits. “For years, it was Tyrone and Cavan, but Derry are now seen as one of the teams that people in Ulster are looking to straight away and Im sure Derry minors wouldve given it a good push this year. “That Lavey team is one of the best minor teams I have seen, I saw them playing Glenullin and winning Ulster last year, and you take the otherteams in around them.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Reading and crosswords have also filled our days,” said Angela. “The mobile library has provided a fantastic service, allowing us to choose and order books online and collect locally. Danielle Steel has been a particular favourite for me, while my husband has continued with his love of Dickens, Steinbeck and Hemingway.”  Despite not visiting family, they have kept in touch. “FaceTime calling has become a regular occurrence, with calls to our grandchildren and listening to our grandson read stories from his school book.”--If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

As Covid- tightens its grip, lockdown restrictions have again been put in place and are likely to remain for some time to come. Schools to shops, work to pubs, restaurants, cinemas and gyms – all aspects of our lives are affected amid the UK Government and Devolved Administrations’ clear clarion calls to stay at home.  Those on the NHS frontline continue to bear the brunt of the pandemic, while other key workers are keeping operating essential services such as supermarkets, pharmacies, waste collection and deliveries.  We can all play our part on the path to freedom. All we have to do is obey the rules. Le in lockdown is undoubtedly dferent. But, embrace it, and it can offer new opportunities.

The Yorkshire couple has exercised more, completed DIY jobs around the house and garden and become well-read. “Like everyone , our world has completely changed,” said Angela. “Work has stopped, usual places we visited closed, and we are not allowed to visit friends and family.     “All our shopping is supermarket click-and-collect or from our local independents and farm shop.” They have two adult children. Daughter Charlotte lives with her partner nearby, while son Lewis lives with his we Lucy and children Harry, aged six, and Lily,  months, in Bournemouth. Angela has not seen them or her parents, who also live in Yorkshire, for  months. The couple love to exercise and have continued to do so within updated rules. “With gyms closing, it was a case of keeping ourselves fit with running, biking, and YouTube yoga and fitness classes online. Reading and crosswords have also filled our days,” said Angela. “The mobile library has provided a fantastic service, allowing us to choose and order books online and collect locally. Danielle Steel has been a particular favourite for me, while my husband has continued with his love of Dickens, Steinbeck and Hemingway.”  Despite not visiting family, they have kept in touch. “FaceTime calling has become a regular occurrence, with calls to our grandchildren and listening to our grandson read stories from his school book.”--If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Although only detailed family history research will confirm the actual Irish origins of your ancestors, surname histories can provide clues and insight into family origins. The  Foyle Community Directory lists , unique surnames in Derry city. Each of these surnames bears a distinctive history and taken as a whole they are a record of population movements into the Derry area over the past  years. Derry’s dynamic history can be seen in the richness and iety of her surnames. googletag.cmd.push The three commonest names have Donegal origins with Doherty heading the way with  entries, followed by McLaughlin on  and Gallagher with  entries. By way of contrast,  surnames occur only once.  Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan and sept names. From the th century each family began to adopt its own distinctive family name generally derived from the first name of an ancestor who lived in or about the th century. The surname was formed by prefixing either ‘Mac’or ‘O’to the ancestor’s name. googletag.cmd.push Surnames in Ireland, therefore, tended to identy membership of a ‘sept’. A sept can be identied as ‘a group of persons who, or whose immediate and known ancestors, bore a common surname and inhabited the same locality’. As a consequence, Gaelic-Irish surnames are still very dominant and numerous in the very districts where their names originated. By tradition, many of the prominent surnames of Gaelic origin in Counties Derry, Donegal and Tyrone today trace their descent from either Eoghan or Conal Gulban, two of the sons of Niall of the Nine Hostages, King of Tara who was slain in  AD.     Those tracing descent from Eoghan include: Brolly, Carlin, Devlin, Donnelly, Duddy, Duffy, Farren, Gormley, Hegarty, McCloskey, McLaughlin, Mellon, Mullen, O’Hagan, O’Kane, O’Neill, Quinn and Toner. From Conall Gulban: Doherty, Friel, Gallagher, McCafferty, McDaid, McDevitt and O’Donnell. By tradition, Eoghan and Conall Gulban conquered northwest Ireland about  AD, and in the process captured the great hill-top fortication of Grianaacuten of Aileach in Inishowen, County Donegal which overlooks the city of Derry and the surrounding countryside. Although Gaelic society was one of the first to adopt a system of hereditary surnames it was also one of the last to perpetuate fixed surnames. People in these societies, in the early th century, were often designated by their genealogies stretching back five or more generations. For example, Shane O’Neill of Shane’s Castle, County Antrim, styled himself on the family vault, which he built in , as ‘Shane McBrien McPhelim McShane McBrien McPhelim O’Neill Esq’. Here is family history in one name stretching back over  years. The last-named Phelim was Felim ‘The Lame’ who was Prince of Clanaboy from  to . The Genealogical Office manuscript collections in Office of the Chief Herald at National Library of Ireland, Dublin are the most important source for the genealogies of Gaelic families and of those families entitled to bear arms either by hereditary right or by grant. On th July , Dr Ramon Salvador O’Dogherty of San Fernando, near Cadiz, Spain was inaugurated as the th O’Dochartaigh, chief of Inishowen, County Donegal. The inauguration ceremony took place on the original ‘crowning stone’, known today as ‘St Columb’s Stone’, inside the walled garden in the grounds of the former Belmont House School, Racecourse Road, Derry, using the ancient ceremonial ritual of the clan: the claimant to the title of ‘The O’Doherty’ standing barefoot on the stone, holding a white wand of hazel wood. By tradition, the crowning stone, blessed by Saint Columba, was carried to Belmont from Grianan of Aileach. By tradition, Grianan is identied as being the great “royal fort” of Aileach, the citadel of the northern Ui Neill from the th to the th century. With the Genealogical Office manuscript collections a family chart can be constructed which, on the male line, records the ancestors of Ramon O’Dogherty, “Chief of the Name”, back through  generations to Niall of the Nine Hostages, th century High King of Ireland Ramon O’Dogherty is descended from Sean, brother of Sir Cahir O’Doherty , who fled from Inishowen to County Cavan and whose descendants settled in Spain, as nobility, in the th century. The founder of the Spanish branch of the O’Doghertys was John who, on the death of his father Eoghan in , came out with his brothers Henry and Clinton Dillon to pursue a career in the Spanish Navy, the most exclusive branch of the Spanish armed forces. Entry required them to show their genealogy, proving noble origin. In  the King of Arms in Dublin Castle confirmed the three brothers as being “descended in a direct line from Shane or Sir John O’Dogherty, Chief of Innish-Owen”. In the th century substantial numbers of English and Scottish families settled in the northern part of Ireland during the so-called Plantation of Ulster. These settlers came to Ulster, by and large, in three waves: with the granting of the initial leases in the period  to  after  and Cromwell’s crushing of the Irish rebellion and, finally, in the fteen years after  and the Glorious Revolution. Famine in Scotlandfrom -, together with landlords in Ulster actively seeking new tenants, resulted in a massive influx of Scottish settlers to Ulster in the s. Substantial numbers of Scottish families entered Ulster through Derry and settled in the Foyle Valley which includes much of the fertile lands of Counties Donegal, Londonderry and Tyrone. The lands along the Firth of Clyde in Ayrshire the Clyde Valley Wigtown, Kirkcudbright and Dumfries in Galloway and the Border Lands of Berwick, Peebles, Selkirk and Roxburgh were home to many of these Scottish settlers. Hence surnames such as Anderson, Arbuckle, Armstrong, Barr, Beattie, Bell, Buchanan, Burns, Campbell, Carruthers, Colhoun, Craig, Cunningham, Dunlop, Elliott, Ferguson, Finlay, Fleming, Frazer, Gillespie, Graham, Grant, Hamilton, Hanna, Haslett, Henderson, Holmes, Houston, Irvine, Irwin, Johnston, Kennedy, Kilgore, Lindsay, McAllister, McCartney, McClean, McClelland, McClintock, McCorkell, McCormick, McDonald, Miller, Mitchell, Montgomery, Moore, Olphert, Orr, Parkhill, Patterson, Patton, Rankin, Robb, Rosborough, Ross, Scott, Starrett, Stewart, Thompson, Wallace, Wilson and Young have been established in northwest Ireland for well over three centuries. More recent arrivals from outside the British Isles have also contributed a small but interesting collection of surnames in the Derry area. An Italian community with surnames such as Battisti, Caffola, Cassoni, Centra, Corrieri, Del Pinto, Fiorentini, Forte, Macari, Vaccaro and Yannarelli settled in Derry in the s.

In this, the first of a series of articles on the most common  local surnames, he explores the background of the names Doherty, McLaughlin, Gallagher and Kelly.  - DOHERTY The surname Doherty, which is by far the most popular name in the city of Derry and the Inishowen peninsula, County Donegal, illustrates the very close links between these two areas. As Derry developed an industrial base in the th century in shirt making, shipbuilding and distilling it attracted much of its workforce from Inishowen. googletag.cmd.push The Doherty sept trace their lineage to Conall Gulban, son of the th century High King of Ireland, Niall of the Nine Hostages, who ruled from the Hill of Tara, County Meath. Conall and his brother Eogan conquered northwest Ireland, ca. AD, capturing the great hill-fort of Grianan of Ailech which commanded the entrance to Inishowen between Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. googletag.cmd.push The Dohertys take their name from Dochartach, twelfth in lineal descent from Conall Gulban and were thus in Gaelic O Dochartaigh. The word dochartach means ‘hurtful’. The original seat of the Doherty clan was at Ardmire or Ard Miodhair, a district to the west of Ballybofey near Lough Finn, County Donegal. In  Donnell Carragh O’Doherty was styled ‘Royal Chieftain of Ardmire’. As the original homeland of the Cenel Eoghainin Inishowen became more and more a northern outpost, as they expanded south and east, the O’Dohertys, a powerful branch of the Cenel Conaill , forced their way into Inishowen.     When Conor O’Doherty died in  he was styled ‘Chief of Ardmire, and Lord of Inishowen’. The Dohertys remained the chief family of Inishowen until their influence was broken after the rebellion of Sir Cahir O’Doherty in , which included the ransacking of the city of Derry. The defeat and execution of Sir Cahir O’Doherty marked the end of Doherty power and paved the way for the th century Plantation of Ulster with English and Scottish settlers. In the centuries that followed the name was anglicised with many iant spellings and in nearly all cases the O prefix was dropped. By  only  per cent were still using it. However, in the th century, many resumed it and by  half of the Dohertys in Ireland had become O’Doherty again.In the th and th centuries many descendants of the old Gaelic order in Ireland emigrated, as the so-called Wild Geese, to Europe, and, in particular, to Spain and France. Dr Ramon Salvador O’Dogherty of San Fernando, near Cadiz, Spain was inaugurated in July  as the th O’Dochartaigh, chief of Inishowen. Ramon O’Dogherty is descended from Sir Cahir’s brother John who fled from Inishowen to County Cavan and whose descendants settled in Spain, as nobility, in the th century. The inauguration ceremony took place on the original ‘crowning stone’, which tradition states was carried from Grianan, in the grounds of the former Belmont House School in Derry, using the ancient ceremonial ritual of the clan: The claimant to the title of ‘The O’Doherty’ standing barefoot on the stone, holding a white wand of hazel wood.   – MCLAUGHLIN  The surname McLaughlin, which is second to Doherty in both Derry city and Inishowen, County Donegal, illustrates the very close links between these two areas. As Derry developed an industrial base in the th century in shirt making, shipbuilding and distilling it attracted much of its workforce from Inishowen. Today, % of Donegal McLaughlins are still concentrated in the Inishowen peninsula. The McLaughlin sept trace their lineage to Eogan, son of the th century High King of Ireland, Niall of the Nine Hostages, who ruled from the Hill of Tara, County Meath. Eogan and his brother Conall Gulban conquered northwest Ireland, ca. AD, capturing the great hill-fort of Grianan of Ailech which commanded the entrance to the Inishowen peninsula between Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. Eogan, styled ‘King of Ailech’, established his own kingdom in the peninsula still called after him Inishowen . Eogan was converted to Christianity by St Patrick, when he travelled to Ailech, ca.  AD. His descendants, known as the Cenel Eoghain , became the principal branch of the Northern Ui Neill . The Cenel Eoghain in the next five centuries expanded to the east and south from their focal point in Inishowen. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. The McLaughlins take their name from Lochlainn, which in turn was derived from a Norse personal name, and were thus in Gaelic Mac Lochlainn, i.e. son of Lochlainn. The McLaughlins were initially the senior branch of the Northern Ui Neill and their territory was in Inishowen. In the th century the McLaughlins, ruling from their royal palace at Ailech in Inishowen, were High Kings of Ireland and patrons of the monastic settlement in Derry. Domhnall Mac Lochlainn, styled ‘King of Ireland’, died at Doire-Choluim-Chillein . After a decisive battle in  at Caimeirgethe O’Neills of Tyrone ousted the McLaughlins as the leading power in Ulster. Brian O’Neill was now ‘installed in the lordship of the Kinel-Owen’. In the th century the Dohertys ousted the McLaughlins as Lords of Inishowen. Some McLaughlins in Ulster, particularly Antrim, may derive from the Argyllshire clan known in Scotland as MacLachlan. The O’Melaghlins of north Leinster have also changed their name to McLaughlin.   - GALLAGHER  Gallagher is the third most common name in Ulster and two-thirds of the Ulster total are in the sept’s homeland of County Donegal where it is the most numerous name. Although it is only the thirteenth most common name in County Derry, it is the third most numerous in the city of Derry. This name illustrates the very close links between the city of Derry and County Donegal. As Derry developed an industrial base in the th century in shirt making, shipbuilding and distilling it attracted much of its workforce from Donegal. The Gallagher sept trace their lineage to Conall Gulban, son of the th century High King of Ireland, Niall of the Nine Hostages, who ruled from the Hill of Tara, County Meath. Conall and his brother Eogan conquered northwest Ireland, ca. AD, capturing the great hill-fort of Grianan of Ailech in County Donegal which commanded the entrance to Inishowen between Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. Conall, styled ‘King of Tir Conaill’, established his own kingdom in County Donegal called after him Tyrconnel, i.e. the ‘Land of Conall’, which was the ancient name of Donegal. His descendants, known as the Cenel Conaill , formed one of the principal branches of the Northern Ui Neill . The septs of the Cenel Conaill firmly established themselves in County Donegal while those descended from Conal’s brother Eogan expanded to the east and south into Counties Derry and Tyrone. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. The Gallaghers take their name from Gallchobhair, and were thus in Gaelic O Gallchobhair, i.e. descendant of Gallagher. This name is derived from gallchobhar, meaning ‘foreign help’. The O’Gallaghers claim to be the senior and most loyal family of the Cenel Conaill. Their territory extended over a wide area in the baronies of Raphoe and Tirhugh in the east and south of County Donegal. The O’Gallaghers, from their bases at Ballybeit and Ballynaglack, were chief marshals and commanders of O’Donnell’s military forces from the th to the th centuries. The O’Gallaghers also provided many wives for the O’Donnell sept. As well as being a military family the Gallaghers have produced many churchmen. Six O’Gallaghers were bishops of Raphoe in the th and th centuries, and Redmond O Gallagher, the th century Bishop of Derry, befriended the survivors of the Spanish Armada. Today the name is found widely in Scotland where it often takes the form Gallacher. It also occurs in the English cities of Liverpool, Manchester and Leeds where it is pronounced ‘Gallocher’.   – KELLY  Kelly is the second commonest family name in Ireland, after Murphy, and part of the reason is that, at least seven and possibly as many as ten distinct septs of the same name arose in dferent parts of the country. Kelly is the sixth most common name in Ulster, and the third most numerous in Counties Derry and Tyrone. The Kelly sept of County Derry trace their lineage to Eogan, son of the th century High King of Ireland, Niall of the Nine Hostages, who ruled from the Hill of Tara, County Meath. Eogan and his brother Conall Gulban conquered northwest Ireland, ca. AD, capturing the great hill-fort of Grianan of Ailech in County Donegal. Eogan, styled ‘King of Ailech’, established his own kingdom in the peninsula in County Donegal still called after him Inishowen . His descendants, known as the Cenel Eoghain , became the principal branch of the Northern Ui Neill . The Cenel Eoghain in the next five centuries expanded to the east and south from their focal point in Inishowen. Ireland was one of the first countries to adopt a system of hereditary surnames which developed from a more ancient system of clan or sept names. The surname was formed by prefixing either Macor Oto the ancestor’s name. Kelly is derived from Gaelic O Ceallaigh, the root word possibly being ceallach meaning stre. The O’Kellys were one of the leading septs of Clan Binnypossessing territory on the banks of the River Foyle near Lford in County Donegal. The first outward thrust of the Owen clan was that of Clan Binny in the th century AD who thrust southeast into County Tyrone, bypassing a hard core of resistance in County Derry of the Cianachta, as far as the river Blackwater on the borders of Tyrone and Armagh. Clan Binny eventually ousted the Oriella clans from the district lying west of the river Bann from Coleraine to beside Lough Neagh, and drove them across the river. In the course of time the O’Kellys moved eastwards into County Derry and were based in the barony of Loughinsholin in south Derry. The most powerful Kelly sept was that of Ui Maine, often called Hy Many, who ruled O’Kelly’s Country in Counties Galway and Roscommon. This sept claims descent from the th century Colla da Crioch, King of Ulster and first King of Oriel. Other O’Kelly septs originated in Counties Kilkenny, Leix, Meath, Sligo and Wicklow. Kelly was known as a surname in Scotland long before th century Irish immigration really established the name there. There was, for example, a Kelly sept attached to Clan Donald. In Thursdays Derry News, Brian Mitchell looks at the history of the names Moore, Coyle, Harkin and Bradley.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was announced last night that the AQE transfer test for primary seven pupils in Northern Ireland, which had been scheduled to take place on February , has been cancelled. AQE have also said that no test will take place this school year. The single test was scheduled after the three tests due to take place in January were cancelled. Post-primary transfer tests are used to select pupils by the majority of NI grammar schools. A number of grammar schools had already said they would not use the test to select pupils this year. googletag.cmd.push Grammar schools who were planning to use the AQE test will now have to find alternative arrangements to admit pupils in . After the announcement was made last night, Education Minister Peter Weir tweeted: “AQE have decided, due to COVID-, that the transfer tests cannot proceed this year. This severely limits parental choice  children’s opportunities, with disappointment for many children  parents. I will continue to work with all stakeholders in these dficult circumstances.” However, his comments were taken by some as criticism of non-grammar schools. In response, Katrina Crilly, principal of Oakgrove College in Derry, wrote: “What a limited comment! This may be your perspective Minister narrow as it is, are you not the Education Minister for all our children and all our schools ” googletag.cmd.push Deirdre OKane, principal of St Patricks and St Brigids in Claudy, wrote: “Mr Weir. As principal of an exceptional non selective school, I an saddened by such a disgraceful, insensitive remark. Having attended a non- selective school myself, I was not, limited.” Martine Mulhern, principal of St Cecilias College in Derry, wrote: “This year we were named ‘UK Secondary School of the Year’ but here in N Ireland our education system will always deem us ‘second class’ because we are a secondary school and not grammar! Described by our own Education Minister as ‘limiting children’s opportunities’ - HOW DARE HE!” Mr Weir later tried to clary his comments by tweeting: “Great opportunities exist throughout our education system, thru both selective and non selective schools, all of which have produced the best of Northern Ireland.

The upgrade at the station, situated at Richill Park off the Crescent Link road in the Lisnagelvin area, includes  custody cells, offices, briefing rooms, catering, changing, storage and ancillary services as well as  parking spaces.The refurbishment also includes a fully automatic addressable fire alarm and detection, public address bomb alert system, fully integrated security, CCTV, perimeter detection, security lighting, electronic access control and staff alarm systems.As a result, nine custody suites at the PSNIs headquarters in the city on Strand Road will close on completion of the Waterside development. The work follows a review by the PSNI of its facilities across the North which will also see the closure of cutody suites in Bangor and Armagh.The PSNI said it had reviewed its custody suites because some were under-used and several needed to be updated to ensure they met health and safety requirements.More than , people are held in police cells every year, many of whom suffer from addiction and mental health problems.The PSNI say the aim is create a more effective and efficient custody service consisting of a fewer number of better-equipped suites, each of which will see the introduction of embedded healthcare and support services to help keep people safe. The PSNI estimate the closures will save around pound million in maintenance costs.It had been hoped to have the Waterside scheme completed later this year but no date has been put on a finish of the local work due to Covid-.. googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Minister McConalogue said: “I am looking at what options might be available to address the situation. “Essentially, this situation is one of the signicant implications of the Brexit negotiations. However, we could have been in a much worse, a much more challenging scenariothere had not been a deal on Christmas Eve past. “It was a possibility access for Irish boats to British waters, which are obviously very close to the Donegal coast, could have been blocked off to our fishermen, and we catch one third of the national catch of fish in British waters. googletag.cmd.push “Also, in that scenario the Northern Irish-registered boats, which are the vessels we are talking about here, would not have had access or permission to come into Irish waters at all. Thankfully, as a result of the deal, that very stark scenario was avoided for our fishing sector,” said Minister McConalogue. Admitting the outcomes were “challenging”, Minister McConalogue they had to be “examined and addressed”. He added: “This [the situation in Greencastle] is one of those outcomes, which has resulted from the international legal status of Britain no longer being a member of the EU. “It requires any boats which are British-registered or Northern Irish-registered to land into designated ports in the Republic. I am very much aware of the issue this creates for local fishermen who fish using Northern Ireland boats. However, Northern Ireland boats now come under the UK fisheries policy rather than the EU Common Fisheries Policy. googletag.cmd.push “I am looking at what options might be available to address the situation. I am looking at them, obviously, with urgency. What we are talking about is the designation of ports, which would meet international criteria and any regulatory infrastructural requirements around that. I am currently investigating what would be required and what it would be possible to do. “I have been taking to many of the fishermen involved and very much understand the implications for them being able to carry out their livelihoods as they had done up until Brexit,” said Minister McConalogue.        --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Derry News has learned that it has become such an issue that Northern Ireland Waterhas recommended that no further connections be made to the networkuntil the necessary work has been carried out to increase thecapacity. This will impact on any planning applications for new properties in the Culmore area. Details of the issues at Culmore Road have emerged after plans were put forward to build  new propertieson a site at  Culmore Road. At present, the site is home to one property, which is called Derrianna. googletag.cmd.push However, the owners of the site want to knock this house down and build  new propertieson the land. The plans for the Culmore Road site were lodged with Derry City and Strabane District Councilsplanning department in November . As part of the planning process, the council contacta range of agencies to ask for theirinputon the proposals. One of the agencies contacted was NI Water. In their response to the council about the plans for  Culmore Road,Robert O’Hare, from Ni Waters Developer Services, said they would have issues with the sewage system in the area. There is a mm diameter public foul sewer which is located on Culmore Road, that is adjacent and near the boundary of the proposed development site, Mr OHare wrote. googletag.cmd.push However, due to the sewer network being at capacity in the Culmore catchment and sewer flows spilling from CSOsinto the environment, NI Water is recommending to council planners that no further connections should be made to this network or a condition should be incorporated which requires an alternative drainage  treatment solution for the proposed site. It is understood that the owners of the site at  Culmore Road are now in discussions with NI Water to look at alternative ways of dealing with sewage from the proposed housing development. However, the fact that the sewage network in the area is at full capacity will continue to have an impact on proposed developments in the area.     The problems being caused by the restricted sewage system in Derry were discussed at Northern Ireland Executive level last year. In March last year, Foyle Sinn Fein MLA Martina Anderson asked Infra- structure Minister Nichola Mallon what stepsshe would be taking to ensure sewerage and wastewater capacity issues did not put building planning applications in Derry on hold. In response, the Minister said NI Water was progressing a Drainage Area Planin the Culmore area. The current forecast completion date for the DAP is summer autumn , she said. NI Waters role in the planning process is that of a statutory consultee. “It has been engaging with Derry City and Strabane District Council on wastewater system capacity issues over several years Over the last two years, substantial survey  investigative work has been undertaken throughout Derry to inform the DAP process, including flow survey, network asset surveys and CCTV investigations. At this point, NI Water will have a more detailed understanding of the capacity issues and as such be better positioned to provide outline solutions. Ms Mallon added: As Minister, I aim to ensure that my Department will do all it can to assist in tackling these capacity issues.However, my budget is subject to a number of competing priorities. “I have, therefore, engaged with the Finance Minister to highlight the critical need to secure the funding that I require to ensure sewerage and wastewater capacity issues do not put building planning applications in Derry and across the north on hold,” the Infrastructure Minister added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

While all of this is well rehearsed, it is no less important because it has been said so many times before.ldquoOne of the first things for me is about all of us behaving aswe have Covid, in terms of social distancing, hand washing and minimising contacts.She appealed to people to only come to hospital when they need to and not to turn up when they donrsquot need to.ldquoWe know that there are instances where it is absolutely vitally important that people present themselvesthey have chest pain orthey think they are having a stroke. It is really important to emphasise that the service is still here for you, continued Ms Patterson.ldquoBut equally for those who do not require an emergency service or hospital at this point in time, we are appealing to you to make these measured judgements.The nursing director said as the coming weeks are going to be dficult, hospitals are not going to be able to care for everyone in the way they normally would, insisting that everyone will do their very best across the organisation to help and support staff to do their best.Ms Patterson added: ldquoWe want to thank those people who have complied with all the guidance. There are many people who have been very good, especially those who are vulnerable and face challenging conditions. What we now need is for more people to follow public health advice to help stop the spread of the virus.Mr Charlie Martyn, the health trustrsquos medical director, said people needed to do more to contain the virus.ldquoWe have all seen people out walking, congregating and meeting up. What we are seeing now around the mixing that has occurred and people meeting over Christmas and New Year is pressures on the wider health system, he said.ldquoWe all need to do better as iniduals and ask people to look at their inidual and collective compliance because we need to get out of this. None of us has faced this situation before. We will do the best we can when patients come into us, buttoo many people come in and there is too big a demand then that poses dficult questions..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th January 2021 Brian.jpg","title":"Brian raises £1%2C250 with charity reindeer and book  ","story":"A LOCAL man has raised pound, for the Motor Neurone Disease Association.Brian Johnston, who lives near Temple, raised the money through the sales of his hand-crafted wooden reindeer and the proceeds of his humour-filled book.Brian Johnston, who recently handed over the money to the charity, says he is overwhelmed by the generosity of many people.Brian has been making his reindeer in the run-up to Christmas for the past five years.Sales in  far outstripped those in previous years, causing Brian to joke that over  reindeer have now found pastures new.Brianrsquos book of humour was also a popular Christmas present for many and sales of the books added to the total raised.

If they had taken one of the other goal chances they mightrsquove cruised home in that game then went in against Donegal.ldquoTherersquos loads of potential, there really is. Irsquom actually looking forward to being a fan this year and going to watch them,wersquore allowed.ldquoTheyrsquove a very exciting forward line and Paddy will always have them well organised defensively.ldquoGetting back up to Division  is big as well. Going up to that level will help bring the squad on and hopefully see us being competitive at Ulster Championship level.ldquoSeeing what Cavan did will have given all the other counties a boost. It should be something that spurs Down on to try and do something similar.Maginn had been one of the Downrsquos main creative forces over the past decade as they battled to make a mark on the Championship scene.Named Down Supportersrsquo Club player of the year in , the classy playmaker was also a pivotal figure as the county saw off Armagh and Monaghan en-route to an unexpected Ulster decider appearance in ,falling to Tyrone at the final hurdle.Under Tally though Down have favoured the raw pace of men like Liam Kerr, Barry OrsquoHagan and Ceilum Doherty in the half-forward line. Maginn felt the time was right to bring his county career to an end.ldquoI pretty much knew towards the end of last season. Obviously Irsquod only really played a fairly minor role towards the end of last season.ldquoI wasnrsquot really featuring in the Championship run. So I had a conversation with Paddy and it was mutual probably.ldquoTheyrsquove a great forward line, a lot of pace, so my time has come to an end. Itrsquos the way the game has evolved - you look at the current Down team, itrsquos full of pace.He added: ldquoIt was a tough call to make, of course. It plays on your head because you always want that big day in the Championship, and we never got that bit of silverware wersquod all have craved.ldquoFor me though, itrsquos just time to move on.

It is also something that we must get right given that this is the last remaining town centre site available for development, he continued. ldquoI firmly believe that this eagerly-awaited regeneration scheme can provide a boost for existing businesses.It has been reported that several High Street retailers have expressed an interest in opening stores at this part of the town and it remains to be seenthis interest remains in the light of the continuing coronavirus pandemic.Cllr Curran hopes these leading retailers remain committed to Downpatrick to trade alongside existing businesses, many of them family-owned.He continued: ldquoThe Irish Street redevelopment proposal offers great potential and can provide a vibrant retail hub that will benefit the business community increasing footfall.ldquoAs I have previously said, the redevelopment of this large, town centre area provides a unique opportunity, the like of which is simply never going to be available again.

Hospitality businesses would have joined them on pm Christmas Day, with a level four lockdown coming into place on Monday, December . The five day lsquorelaxationrsquo period would have still been in place according to these rules, but a change from three households mixing to two.But on Saturday, December , all this changed as prime minister Boris Johnson held a press conference to update the UK on the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus and announcing that the South East of England, including London would be moved into tier four.Tier four means residents must stay at home with some limited exemptions ndash which includes workunable to do so from home, however, working from home is strongly advisedit is possible. Non-essential services must also close. People also must not enter or leave a tier four area.This also saw a change to Englandrsquos Christmas restrictions, with households banned from mixing, apart from single households, which would be allowed to form a bubble to avoid isolation.Areas in the lower tiers were still allowed to continue to mix with up to three households ndash however, only on Christmas Day.So, what did this announcement mean for Wales The announcement by the prime minister was focused specically on England, but it was followed by Walesrsquo first minister making an announcement of his own the same evening. He announced that the tier four lockdown would come into place from midnight on Saturday, December , meaning businesses had a matter of hours to come to terms with the news and people rushed out to do some last-minute Christmas shopping before all the non-essential retail closed.Some of the supermarkets across Wales have now taken their lsquonon-essentialrsquo items off sale.The festive period bubble rule has also changed, with a maximum of two households allowed to mix on Christmas Day.MORE NEWS:Mr Drakeford said in a statement on Saturday evening that the pattern of transmission in London and the South East of England, which is linked to the new iant of coronavirus, is ldquoremarkably consistent with the rapid acceleration of transmission in Wales in recent weeks.Also in the statement, the first minister said that latest evidence had suggested the new strain is present throughout Wales and that it needed an ldquoimmediate response.After meeting with the Welsh Governmentrsquos Cabinet on Saturday and taking into consideration advice from senior medical and scientic advisors, he said: ldquoThe situation is incredibly serious. I cannot overstate this.ldquoWe have therefore reached the dficult decision to bring forward the alert level four restrictions for Wales, in line with the action being taken in London and the South East of England.Dr Chris Williams, incident director for the Novel Coronavirusoutbreak at Public Health Wales said in a statement: ldquoAs indicated by the Welsh Government, the immediate introduction of new restrictions is related to the identication of a new more transmissible iant of Coronavirus. Public Health Wales has been working with UK partners to investigate and respond to this iant.ldquoIt is normal for viruses to undergo mutations, and we expect this to happen. Although the iant is easier to transmit, there is currently no evidence that it is more severe.ldquoWe are reminding people that all current guidance relating to Coronavirus continues to apply to the new iant, including advice relating to symptoms, social distancing, self-isolation, and vaccination.ldquoThe new iant shows up as positive in Public Health Walesrsquo existing Coronavirus tests, and people must continue to seek a test in the usual waythey develop Coronavirus symptoms.ldquoIf you or a member of your household develop a cough, fever or change in sense of taste or smell, you must self-isolate immediately and book a free Coronavirus test by calling .ldquoPublic Health Wales urges everyone to follow the rules, to avoid transmission of Coronavirus and to protect everyone in our communities, including the most vulnerable. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

As with other nursing pioneers like Mary Seacole, Florence Nightingale shone a lamp of hope across the world.ldquoToday, our frontline services still shine that lamp for us ndash supported by the amazing achievements of modern science ndash and we owe them a debt of gratitude.ldquoWe continue to be inspired by the kindness of strangers and draw comfort that ndash even on the darkest nights ndash there is hope in the new dawn.MORE NEWS:Do you know what happened to this poor kitten How Sully came together at Christmas through the power of the artsAll the supermarket opening times over Christmas and New YearldquoJesus touched on this with the parable of the Good Samaritan. The man who is robbed and left at the roadside is saved by someone who did not share his religion or culture. This wonderful story of kindness is still as relevant today.ldquoGood Samaritans have emerged across society showing care and respect for all, regardless of gender, race or background, reminding us that each one of us is special and equal in the eyes of God.ldquoThe teachings of Christ have served as my inner light, as has the sense of purpose we can find in coming together to worship.ldquoIn November, we commemorated another hero ndash though nobody knows his name. The Tomb of the Unknown Warrior isnrsquot a large memorial, but everyone entering Westminster Abbey has to walk around his resting place, honouring this unnamed combatant of the First World War mdash a symbol of selfless duty and ultimate sacrice.ldquoThe Unknown Warrior was not exceptional. Thatrsquos the point. He represents millions like him who throughout our history have put the lives of others above their own, and will be doing so today. For me, this is a source of enduring hope in dficult and unpredictable times.ldquoOf course, for many, this time of year will be tinged with sadness: some mourning the loss of those dear to them, and others missing friends and family members distanced for safety, when all theyrsquod really want for Christmas is a simple hug or a squeeze of the hand.ldquoIf you are among them, you are not alone, and let me assure you of my thoughts and prayers.ldquoThe Bible tells how a star appeared in the sky, its light guiding the shepherds and wise men to the scene of Jesusrsquos birth.

This aimed to allow a quick ruling which could act as guidance to other insurers and other policies on whether they should pay out.ndash What kind of policies did businesses have Before the pandemic, many businesses only had insurance covering direct damage to their property.However some had policies designed to pay outtheir business was interrupted by disease, and others had paid for policies that would activateaccess to their business was prevented by a public authority, orthey were ordered to close.There were many dferent policies, but the ones tested by the courts included some of the most common wording.ndash Why were insurers not paying out The insurance companies had several arguments why they should not have to pay. Some said their business interruption clauses were only activateda local disease caused a business to suffer. Because the coronavirus lockdown was nationally mandated, insurers argued they did not have to pay out.Other arguments hinged on a precedent set in a  High Court case which found that an insurer did not have to pay out business interruption insurance to a New Orleans hotel after hurricanes Katrina and Rita.The insurer only had to compensate the hotel for direct damage the hurricane caused, and argued that the hotelrsquos business would have been interrupted whether or not it was directly damaged, so only paid out part of the insurance.ndash What happens next The case was never meant to iron out all dficulties, just to get clarity on some common issues that many policyholders were running into when trying to get a payout.ldquoTodayrsquos judgment does not determine how much is payable under inidual policies, but provides much of the basis for doing so, the FCA said.Insurers decided to pay out claims on some policies after an earlier High Court ruling on the issue. They had also been asked by the FCA to progress some applications so they were ready to be settled rapidly when the Supreme Court ruled.Policyholders who are affected can expect to hear from their insurer soon, the FCA said, and should approach their advisers or insurers with any questions.The FCA has already published draft guidance on how a business can prove Covid- was present in their local area, which is required for some policies..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Covid- insurance ruling: How did we get here and what next  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments are closed on this article. -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

A spokesperson said: Due to the very high levels of COVID- transmission across our community, the four UK Chief Medical Officers have advised that we now move into alert level , which requires the strictest of social distancing given the threat that health and social care services could become overwhelmed and therefore impacts on visiting to all care settings across Northern Ireland. Subsequently the Western Health and Social Care Trust have assessed all elements of risk and in order to protect patients, visitors and staff, the decision has been made to temporarily suspend visiting on all sites and facilities within the Western Trust. This suspension will now apply from midnight on Thursday, January . While we recognise that restriction to visiting is a very emotive and dficult issue, often causing distress for families, patients and residents, it is essential that these updated visiting restrictions are effectively applied to help bring the transmission of COVID- under control. There will becertain exceptional circumstances which will continue to apply. If you are permitted to visit hospital or a care facility under any of the special circumstances above you MUST wear a face covering, thoroughly wash your hands or use sanitiser when entering and exiting that facility. PLEASE DO NOT visityou are feeling unwell, especiallyyou have a high temperature or new persistent cough or have a sudden loss of taste or smell, the spokesperson continued. Children are not permitted to visit. The Trust acknowledges that this is a very dficult time for the public and we ask you to work with us and appeal to patients and visitors to respect our staff and the guidance they give you at all times. The Trust operates a ‘Zero Tolerance’ policy and we will not accept any form of abuse towards our staff. You can also continue to arrange a ‘virtual visit’ with your relative or friend on a smartphone or tablet. Our hospitals have access to free Wi-Fi and our staff can help set this up. Please be patient. Our staff will have to prioritise clinical work and patient care. We are very sorry to have to move to this position of suspending visiting to all our hospitals and facilities as we understand how important this is for people, but we must immediately apply this in the best interest of the health and safety for everyone until such time as the transmission of COVID- reduces. The Trust said the guidance will be kept under constant review. A breakdown of all exceptional circumstances included as part of the temporary suspension of visiting to Western Trust facilities is available to view on the Trust website.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_affcafaadae   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ebbccdbcc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
