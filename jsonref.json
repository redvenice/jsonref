Young people, who spend an hour a day on YouTube, are leading this shift in habits.Yih-Choung Teh, from Ofcom, said: ‘The way we watch TV is changing faster than ever before. In the space of seven years, streaming services have grown from nothing to reach nearly half of British homes.         Some 38 per cent of online viewers can imagine not watching traditional TV at all in five years’ time‘But traditional broadcasters still have a vital role to play, producing the kind of brilliant UK programmes that overseas tech giants struggle to match.’The survey found 38 per cent of online users can imagine not watching broadcast TV at all within five years.UK-made drama still resonates with audiences, with Bodyguard on BBC One the most-watched show in 2018.But Ofcom said ‘a few popular drama and entertainment programmes are not enough on their own to stem the overall decline in broadcast TV viewing’.It said ITV was heavily reliant on its top ten regular programmes, including Coronation Street, Emmerdale, The Chase, ITV News and Tipping Point. In 2018, these accounted for 50 per cent of total minutes viewed on the channel but only 8 per cent of total output.The public service channels were still the preferred place to watch national events and viewers felt broadly satisfied with the quality of broadcast TV, according to Ofcom.Bad language, violence, discrimination and sexual content remained the top four concerns in terms of offensiveness."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc73cfedc33de8b14cb08ad3730ce701c4f656d7/0_701_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d583f7f61e38c17f6562fdd6fe4d9606","title":"tips links and suggestions what are you reading this week","story":"Your space to discuss the books you are reading and what you think of them Welcome to this week’s blogpost. Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.“It’s Mark Twain these days,” says voicefrombelgrade, “I’m rereading his short story collection”:Every time I read The Experience Of The McWilliamses With Membranous Croup, Extracts from Adam’s Diary, Eve’s Diary, The Stolen White Elephant... I just love them. Also, I pilfered Tom Sawyer from my late father’s library (all right, I’ll take it back, my mom won’t even know that I took it...) – it’s a masterful Serbian translation from the 1949 (the author is Stanislav Vinaver). It’s relatively rare to find a translation that’s as good as the original, but this one really is, and I just have to revisit it every so often.BaddHamster is “finishing up” The House Of Sleep by Jonathan Coe:Warm, funny, breezily paced (as always with him) and a few interesting thoughts on the nature of sleep. Basically, if you like Coe, you’ll probably enjoy it. I do and I am.And CharlieBing “just finished” Judith Schalansky’s Pocket Atlas of Remote Islands:As a cartographer by training and a sometime graphic artist by trade, I just loved almost every bit of this beautifully designed book ... a minor quibble with the occasional use of yellow text on white pages, but the typography is exquisite, the whole conceit just wonderful.Michael, a retired headmaster grieving for his wife, the victim of a terrorist attack, asks himself the question of who is really responsible for what happened, not the bombers themselves, not the bomb makers, but the ‘bomb-triggerers’ – the politician enriching himself from his time in office. There’s much more to this story than vengeance though the narration soon reveals darker aspects of Michael’s character as he recalls his career. Good’s skill is in the narrator considering himself as a realist struggling with difficult pupils, but coming over to the reader as anything but that, and a cruel authoritarian.As an ex-teacher of 31 years, this is an admirably accurate portrayal of some headteacher’s traits I have seen all too frequently.Reading Isabel Allende’s Daughter Of Fortune has been “an exquisite pleasure” for PatLux:Such a rich historical novel in which I, like one of the main protagonists Tao Chi’en, learned lots. I loved the lyrical evocative prose which stimulated all my senses. One of those books that makes you feel you are on a delightful journey with the characters and evokes laughter and sadness. And it stays with you in the intervals between when you put it down and pick it up again. I will definitely be reading more Allende.MachenBach recommends Augustus Carp, Esq., By Himself: Being the Autobiography of a Really Good Man:A satirical mock-autobiography, published anonymously by Sir Henry Howarth Bashford in 1924. Anthony Burgess singled it out as one of the 20th century’s funniest books, but I would say that it’s consistently amusing, rather than LOL funny. Still, that’s rare enough to be noteworthy. Carp is possessed of a Pooterishly inflated sense of his own (and his father’s) importance, and almost total blindness to his own limitations and motivations. He’s a hilariously sanctimonious self-professed Christian (or “Xtian”), who frequently goes out into the streets to lecture smokers, drinkers and music hall artistes on the evils of their ways, but who seems hypocritically blind to his own acts of bullying, blackmail, and greed. Like a monstrous cross between Pooter and Ignatius J Reilly, his voice is impressively realised, and the irony well sustained. I’m not sure how much real satirical bite it had at the time – it seems rather more 1890s than 1920s in many ways, and the joke does wear a little thin long before he gets his comeuppance, but it’s very well-written (in a pretentiously archaic register) and generally good fun.Finally, Dennis89 suggests we give “serious thought” to reading An Armenian Sketchbook by Vasily Grossman:A 200-page account detailing the writer’s reflections, thoughts and wanderings during his visit to Armenia at the twilight of his life. Justification for the journey is provided by the task of editing a Russian translation of a local Armenian novel though the trip allows Grossman to explore and delve far more deeply into this marginalised and often overlooked country.Faith, patriotism, oppression, comradeship and other such topics are beautifully mused upon in this life-affirming gem of a book.Sounds fantastic. (That’s also an excellent excuse to link to Linda Grant’s fine article on reading Grossman: “It took me three weeks to read it and three weeks to recover from the experience.”)If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Not one of the vast caverns like Old Trafford or Wembley, but somewhere rather smaller and more bijou. Somewhere like Fulham’s Craven Cottage, which, once its new stand is completed, will pack in only about 30,000 fans. Now imagine this stadium of 30,000 souls rising up into the air and hovering unnoticed over central London. Thirty thousand men in late middle-age living the high life with the capital at their feet – and there, stuck way below on terra firma are their 66 million fellow Britons, tearing lumps out of each other.Congratulations: you’ve just pictured the central problem stalking the UK today. Not Brexit. Not the breakdown in civil debate. Not the dark money contaminating Westminster. These are urgent and vitally important, but there is one big factor that forms a large part of the backdrop to all of them. It can be summed up by that gulf between a mid-sized football stadium of super-rich men in their 50s, and the rest of us spread out across our suburbs, our towns, our unpretty stretches of urban sprawl.This isn’t a story of the capital versus the rest. Among the parliamentary seats with the highest concentration of top earners is Hornsey and Wood Green in north London: it butts right up against Edmonton, where I was born and raised and which today suffers some of the worst deprivation in the UK, and sees none of the power and glory of the global metropolis.At heart, this is about how relatively few people in a small cluster of professions and industries, living in a tiny number of neighbourhoods, are enjoying riches beyond belief. And all this while wages for the median worker barely rise, and the schools and hospitals and libraries and parks on which the rest of us depend are run down to breaking point.And this, mark you, is without factoring in wealth. Indeed, what’s striking about the super-rich is how little we know about them – including how much they really earn. Those at the bottom, on the other hand – well, we intrude on their lives all the time. We interrogate that asylum seeker for graphic detail on how she was raped, or that benefits claimant for why he’d spent that amount of money on seeing his family.Whatever the critics might allege, Jeremy Corbyn’s complaints about a rigged economy aren’t populism at all they are a fundamentally accurate depiction of a vastly unpopular system. And until it is dealt with, the chaos that Britain is now in will not go away. Real material grievances sparked the vote to leave, and they make the chess-playing indulged in by the politicians and pundits (national unity! Cross-party alliances!) look just that – indulgent.Instead, we are now run by the chief wealth apologist of our times. The man now buffooning around No 10 not so long ago claimed that “a pound spent in Croydon is of far more value … than a pound spent in Strathclyde”. When overlord of City Hall, he rejoiced that “London is to billionaires what the jungles of Sumatra are to the orangutan. It is their natural habitat.” And his government is about to follow the same trickle-down economics that got Britain to this political and economic dead end. His trade secretary, Liz Truss, jaunts off to America on fact-finding trips about Reaganomics when the best bit of research she could read on that grotesque failure comes from researchers at the IMF, who found that the more money goes to the rich in any country, the slower an economy grows. They concluded: “The benefits do not trickle down. In contrast, an increase in the income share of the poor is associated with higher GDP growth.”A few weeks before the 2016 Brexit referendum, I spent a morning at Newport’s Covered Market. So bored did I get with the number of people telling me they were voting to leave that I started asking a supplementary question: do you consider yourself a winner or a loser? It was a deliberately vague question. A winner how? A loser to whom? But the thing that struck me was how many of the leavers instantly told a complete stranger that they were losers. And they knew who the winners were: those refugees on the other side of the city the next-door neighbour who’d got a cushy number on benefits.Well, it turns out that we’re all losers – but instead of looking down or across at those getting ahead, we should really have been looking up. “Up through the atmosphere!  Up where the air is clear!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/673ffd0bd82dfc5e93c4dd5100fe13bb212fa6bd/0_62_5469_3283/master/5469.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3766a9245539f4dfa2540efb101dcb21","title":"summer job pork rolls country show","story":"Thanks to a dead pig on a spit, I befriended strangers, blagged free biscuits and learned to wield power from the lowliest of positionsA hot pork roll stand in Peterborough isn’t the most obvious place to find out you’re a natural despot, but it’s where my inner dictator first emerged in the working world. I was benevolent yet damning. I ruled with an iron fist (and fork). In essence, I was the Catherine the Great of country shows in the 90s. And I loved it.I didn’t start off that way. The world of work terrified me. I wasn’t remotely practical, I found other humans largely terrifying and an onslaught of hungry strangers pressed a lot of anxiety buttons in my brain. But in front of a spit I discovered the full force of my naturally loud voice, my instinctive girl-boss spirit and the fact I adored being in charge of just about anything.When you’re dishing out pork crackling you have power. Real power. People get feudal about crispy animal skin. Standing in front of a twirling dead pig doesn’t sound like a situation from which to dish out summary justice but as summer jobs go it was simple: I was the Pork Tsar. I made my own laws and customs. My task was simple enough – pick up a cob, place stuffing, roast pork and crackling on top and ladle in a bit of gravy. But the quantities of that concoction could be subtly changed to reflect the qualities of the customer. A “please” and a smile earned more crackling. A lack of manners got fatty meat and a gravy overdose that would lead to a soggy bap – and that’s hard to handle in a field with one napkin. It’s a movable punishment of a feast.I may have been just the girl serving in a blue and white apron that made me look like a demented butcher but there should have been a crown on my head: I could make or break lunches. And I did. I was the Porcine Queen. Three days in, I’d gone full Stalin. Stuffing could be reduced to a scant scraping. Crackling quantities became even more arbitrary. Polite women with children and good-looking men got piles of the stuff. Grunting young farmers who I suspected had Tory leanings got none at all. I was out of control. It was fantastic. No one complained. And I discovered a beautiful thing: I could be friendly but intimidating.Sadly the country show gig economy meant that you leapt from one event to another. The fiefdom I had lovingly created stopped as soon as it had started. My next job was looking after the campsite at a three-day event, which meant serving the middle and upper horsey classes. I had a working-class chip on my shoulder the size of the country park the thing was being held in and the thought of being looked down on made me incandescent, especially now I knew I was born to rule.A mound of students were paired up at random. Andy from Oakham (dark hair, Leeds University, funny, liked Suede and Björk, had girlfriend – damn) was a congenial companion. Things could be distasteful but there was satisfaction in tackling the unspeakable on a strictly temporary basis. Once you’ve cleaned the toilets and emptied the bins of people who eat a lot of game, most things in life seem manageable. Assumptions about the appalling snobbery of dressage fans were tossed aside as various old ladies in Barbour jackets and Hunter wellies invited us in for tea and snacks to escape the rain. Sitting on heavily patterned deckchairs in blue overalls being offered a cursory read of Horse and Hound was a surreal experience, especially when you smelt of bleach. The campers were partly being kind but Andy and I knew they were also eyeing our toilet rolls. It worked. The tents that gave us fruitcake got extra stock in their nearest portable toilets. Equestrianism is not a cheap pursuit. You’re always trying to make savings. This was a symbiotic relationship – biscuits for toiletries.We became very adept at getting fed for free. We gorged ourselves on free samples from the Phileas Fogg snack stand and ate endless chutneys on wafer-thin biscuits. Ingenuity, blagging and, at times, total cheek: vital skills for a life in the creative industries were being primed.Once the event finished we were the ones cleaning up, and we got to collect the spoils. Disappointingly, this amounted to a six-foot cardboard cutout of a man in lederhosen advertising Emmental cheese. I took it back to my student house in Hull, where it lived on the stairs to deter burglars.At the time, my summer jobs seemed inconsequential – but this rural work boosted my confidence, blew apart some long-held assumptions and taught me some valuable life lessons. Most notably, that you can’t judge a woman by her chosen sport, that free food is good food, and that power can be created and seized just by dishing up dead pig. I will for ever embrace my inner crackling dictator (despite being a vegetarian). She’s won me some notable professional battles, far away from any field in Cambridgeshire.• Rae Earl is a writer and broadcaster"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8d0b275be96fc94f793eb55349124d27e5c920f/51_0_5215_3129/master/5215.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a148c41b4f550614f707644b1718ed8","title":"parents devastated by closure of bristol special needs school","story":"Children ‘traumatised’ by sudden closure of St Christopher’s over safeguarding concernsParents have expressed their devastation at the sudden closure of a special needs residential school in Bristol, which left their children – who have severe and complex learning difficulties – distraught and without suitable alternative placements.Parents were called at work and summoned to pick up their children from St Christopher’s – an independent special school and care home in Westbury Park in the north of the city – after the schools’ regulator Ofsted suspended its registration because of safeguarding concerns.Police have confirmed they are investigating allegations of child cruelty and a number of staff have been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation. However, parents are furious at the way the closure was handled, with little warning or apparent forethought.Parents were handed their children’s belongings in black binbags, while some children were bussed to emergency placements around the country. Other parents, who have not lived with their children for years due to their extreme, challenging behaviour, had no choice but to take them home.One parent described witnessing an “auction”, as alternative providers selected pupils they were willing to take on while rejecting others. Some parents said they were having to give up work to look after their children others said their children had been traumatised by the experience and had regressed.“I feel they have left the children in a more vulnerable position than if they would have stayed there,” said James Cole, whose 13-year-old son Jacob has lived at St Christopher’s for a year and a half. “To just pull the plug without any due care to the lives of those children is unbelievable.”Jacob, who has autism, epilepsy and displays challenging behaviour, is now at home while his parents struggle to find an alternative place. “St Christopher’s was quite unique in that it took so many children with so many complexities because they had such good services there. It’s hard to find that replicated elsewhere.”Cole said it took months of careful investigations for parents with children like Jacob to find suitable placements, which can cost around £300,000 a year. Yet the sudden closure of St Christopher’s meant some children were moved elsewhere in hours. “It was absolutely dreadful,” he said.One mother, who asked to remain anonymous, described seeing her 15-year-old son lying on the grass sobbing, his carers lying alongside, cuddling him and crying too. “These poor children. It’s had a massive impact on them,” she said.Her son is now at home, which will have an enormous impact on family life. “He is very stressed. He is going to miss all the really good carers who looked after him. He had an amazing team around him. We will not let our son go anywhere else now.”Other parents are having to contemplate travelling huge distances to find a suitable placement. “We live in Bath and we’ve been offered a place in Northumberland or Shrewsbury,” said Kevin Maxwell, whose 16-year-old son, Jonah, is one of the 27 pupils moved out of St Christopher’s last week.An Ofsted spokesperson said St Christopher’s was inspected in June and judged to be inadequate. The inspection related to the residential part of the provision, rather than the school. “On Monday 29 July, we issued St Christopher’s with a suspension of registration notice because of serious concerns about safeguarding.”Avon and Somerset police confirmed: “We’re investigating allegations of child cruelty offences relating to a special education school in the north Bristol area. We’re working with our multi-agency partners to ensure that safeguarding measures are being put in place and Ofsted has been notified. Parents have been contacted. Some members of staff have been suspended while our investigation continues.”In 2016 St Christopher’s was threatened with closure because it had become economically unviable and was taken over by the Aurora Group, a private company specialising in special education care. An Aurora spokeswoman said: “We are deeply concerned about the serious allegations against a small number of staff who were immediately suspended,” a spokesperson said.“They were reported to the authorities straight away in line with our safeguarding procedures. We are now focused on doing all that we can to support the children, young people, their families and carers, and the many caring and dedicated staff who are affected during this difficult time.”Dr Jacqui Jensen, executive director of people services at Bristol city council, which is one of the local authorities responsible for pupils at the schools, said: “We are working with the families, other local authorities and a range of partners to review everyone’s inidual care plans and make alternative arrangements for the provision of care and education.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5b07a4d795bc4ba68449bddc798164d0d0c71ca/0_234_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1e3d72e7814090d2739019abe280016","title":"whaley bridge dam reconstruction could take years locals told","story":"News comes as some evacuated residents are told they will be able to return homeIt could take years to reconstruct the damaged dam above the Derbyshire town of Whaley Bridge, residents have been told, as some of the 1,500 evacuated were promised that they would now be allowed to return to their homes.At a community meeting, Derbyshire police said that residents of one part of the town could begin to go back to the village after water levels in Toddbrook reservoir dropped rapidly. But some still face waiting until after a Wednesday inspection to be certain that their homes are absolutely safe.A spokesman for the Environment Agency at the meeting in nearby Chapel-en-le-Firth said that it was hard to know how long the reconstruction of the dam would take.“We are very much in the emergency phase now and we are currently repairing and carrying out construction work,” he said. “It is a long-term construction project, but we will not have started from scratch. It could take 18 months, two years, three years, who knows?”Rachel Swann, deputy chief constable of Derbyshire police, told the meeting that residents of the Horwich End area could return home.“I have got a meeting at 12pm tomorrow where I am expecting we will have good news,” she said. “We have obviously been pumping the water out and it has gone down at a fast speed. It is now beyond 9.5 metres. We will keep draining the water until it is safe to stop.”Earlier emergency crews who had pumped 1.2m tonnes of water from the damaged reservoir were told they had reached their target.The Canal and River Trust had said it needed to drop the water level by eight metres and confirmed the level was now down to 8.4 metres.The trust said: “The water has been pumped out at a controlled rate and good progress is being made.”Nonetheless, Derbyshire fire and rescue service urged caution after residents were given false hope of being able to return to their homes.In response to a tweet saying “the dam is considered safe”, the fire service said: “Nowhere have we said that the dam is safe now. Work is ongoing, and road closures and evacuations are still in place to preserve life.“We will open roads and let people return home as soon as we can, but we have no way of knowing when this will be.”Fire crews have been using dozens of high-volume pumps to remove the reservoir’s water since part of its spillway collapsed on Thursday afternoon following days of heavy rainfall.As residents were evacuated an RAF Chinook helicopter was drafted in and began to drop hundreds of bags of sand and aggregate to shore up the slipped pieces of concrete.Since then seven tonnes of water a minute have been pumped out of the structure, built in 1831, drastically lowering the threat of flooding across the valley down towards the towns and villages of the High Peak.The water taken out of the reservoir has been directed into a sluice channel before being dropped into the River Goyt. The Environment Agency confirmed it was monitoring water levels in the river.Meanwhile, work on the damaged dam was hampered by subsidence overnight. Tonnes of gravel and stone that had been loaded into the damaged section of the dam since Friday had “settled” resulting in the Chinook returning and dropping a further 50 tonnes of aggregate to repair the area.Previously police and local authorities criticised around 31 residents who decided to stay in their homes within the evacuation zone, saying they were “taking their lives into their own hands” and jeopardising the safety of the emergency services.Malcolm Venton and Lorraine Ellis told the  they could not leave their two border collies, Meg and Amy. The couple were asked to leave on Saturday when the evacuation zone was extended, but decided to hunker down, despite the threat of a huge wave rushing out of the reservoir."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19bffc0d0c0368b98a848e2b108703c005ba132f/0_41_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a61c5a9991520ca3f588aaa7763e0411","title":"derby sign wayne rooney player coach","story":"• England’s record goalscorer will arrive in January• ‘I have a lot of quality I can bring to the squad’Hours after flying into the country to announce a sensational return to English football by signing for Derby, Wayne Rooney said his appetite for success remains as intense as ever. “I’m delighted to be back and to try to help the team go forward and hopefully push for promotion,” said the 33-year-old. “It’s football, it’s been my whole life, it’s what I love.”England’s record goalscorer has agreed an 18-month contract with the Championship side, with the option of another year. He will start in J-anuary after completing the MLS season with DC United. His role at Pride Park will involve coaching as well as playing but he is adamant the emphasis will be on the latter, being careful to spell out that, although he has ambitions to manage one day, here he will be a pupil of the manager, Phillip Cocu, and not a threat.“I feel I have a lot of quality I can bring to the squad so, first and foremost, I want to play and help the team,” said Rooney as he sat beside Cocu.Cocu, who oversaw a victory at Huddersfield on Monday in his first match in charge, professed to being excited by the recruitment coup. “He’s a star player with extreme quality,” said the Dutchman.Rooney added: “Derby is a club with great ambitions. They’ve put a lot of money into the squad over the years and I felt my experience could help them take that next step.”Rooney will be paid around £90,000 per week and will wear a shirt bearing 32, the same number that appears in the name of the online betting casino that signed a record sponsorship contract with Derby this month. “The number is no big deal,” said Rooney when asked about its significance.Rooney is stepping up his pursuit of his coaching qualifications and revealed that an instructor from the Football Association will fly to the United States next week to oversee his progress. “I started doing my coaching badges a few years ago, but through my children I couldn’t always find time to fit them in,” he said. “The FA are flying out next Monday to continue them, and when I’m back in England I’ll have more time to fulfil the requirements. Your badges are obviously important, every coach needs to go through that process. Even during the coaching badges you can learn new things.”Rooney said he has been thinking about moving into management for at least five years and started gaining hands-on experience while at Old Trafford. “When Louis van Gaal was manager at Manchester United, Ryan Giggs was analysing the opponents and I used to go in there a lot for a few hours after training. Then at Everton I’d speak to the coaches.“I’ve always been interested in it. At DC I speak to the coaches a lot about how we’re going to prepare the game and set up. It’s something which, when you’re interested and have an open mind, you always speak to your teammates or coaches about it.”He said the manager with whom he spent most of his playing career made the comment that made the deepest impression on him. “There’s a lot of things that stick with you from managers but I remember Alex Ferguson saying: ‘The hardest thing to do in life is to work hard.’ That’s true, no matter what you do. Whether it’s football or a job in an office, the most difficult thing is to stay motivated and work hard. If you can do that, it’s a great quality to have.”He has no doubt he has that quality. “That comes from where you grow up and how you’re brought up. It was instilled in me as a child.”As for what type of manager he envisages himself becoming, he was not about to make any grand claims. “That’s in the future. We all want to be like the great managers.”His next main influence will be Cocu, a distinguished former player who has forged a fine career as a manager, including three Dutch league titles. He said he is familiar with the process Rooney is set to go through."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16cafb7c55497fae1acd3767a94af9f8cb9ecc0d/168_119_5343_3206/master/5343.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2d854ab5bbf3cc3e7e575ba2e51a56c","title":"moise kean responsibilty everton premier league","story":"Everton fans have raised more than £2,700 for a banner that will proclaim they stand side-by-side with Moise Kean in his fight against racism. It represents a show of unity that was sorely lacking in April when the 19-year-old faced down his abusers while playing for Juventus against Cagliari, although the £29m striker insists that sorry episode is not why Italian football has lost one of its finest young talents.“No, absolutely not,” the teenager says when asked whether the racist abuse he suffered at Cagliari, and the fall-out from it, is why he swapped the Old Lady of Turin for the Grand Old Lady of Goodison Park. “I like Everton. This is the reason I came here. I recognise myself in this team. Everton are looking ahead to the future and so am I.”Kean’s determination to look ahead to a new start in a new country should not, however, be seen as an attempt to draw a veil over the recent past. The Italy international is quite willing to discuss his stand against racism and what occurred in the seconds, hours and weeks after his goal against Cagliari last season.Kean celebrated that close-range strike with a defiant stare, arms aloft, in front of the home fans who had jeered his every touch. Instead of support he was rebuked for the celebration by the then Juventus coach, Massimiliano Allegri. His teammate Leonardo Bonucci went further, claiming “the blame is 50-50” for the abuse that intensified after Kean’s goal.Bonucci later backtracked and was condemned by Allegri. Serie A officials described the chants as “certainly reprehensible”, but took no action against Cagliari on the grounds they “had an objectively limited relevance to race”.Kean insists he was not left isolated by his former club. “Juventus were on my side, they helped me,” he says. “We have to fight against racism, everybody knows that, and the club was very helpful to me in that situation.”But what of Bonucci, his senior colleague for club and country? “I didn’t pay any attention to that comment. I was concentrating strongly on playing to the best of my ability so that I could repay Juventus for the support they gave me. I spoke with him later and he apologised. He told me he was wrong and that he didn’t know what he was talking about.”Kean repaid Juventus with six goals in 13 league appearances last season as they took the Italian title for an eighth year in a row. He scored eight goals in 21 games in total for Juventus, was the club’s youngest debutant at 16 years and 23 days, yet was allowed to leave an ageing side despite long being heralded as their future. The teenager, who comes across as a thoughtful and determined character, explains it was his decision to leave a Champions League contender, a Serie A winning regular, in search of greater responsibility with Everton.Kean claims he has not turned his back on Champions League football by joining a team that finished eighth last season. “It is part of the ambition of any player to help bring his team to the Champions League,” he says. “What I want is to bring Everton into the Champions League.” Evertonians launched a JustGiving campaign on the day Kean signed to raise £1,000 for a banner that will be unveiled at his home debut against Watford on Saturday week. The target was surpassed in 24 hours and the extra money raised will be split equally between Kick It Out and Everton In The Community.“It’s beautiful because racism is horrendous and we have to fight against it,” Kean says. “I’m going to repay the fans for all they do for me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2852a0d9675e7c585c4723b0dcacd1cd497c6736/0_0_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffbf0a0916b8516d2613ac4b596e9e1f","title":"tottenham prepare 644m bid for juventuss paulo dybala","story":"Tottenham are preparing a €70m (£64.4m) bid for Juventus’s Paulo Dybala and have also been offered the chance to sign Barcelona’s Coutinho on loan.The Serie A club are willing to consider the sale of the talented but inconsistent Argentinian but are holding out for around £70m for the 25-year-old. A much bigger problem for Spurs would be to agree personal terms with Dybala.The Argentinian is earning more than £300,000 a week at Juventus before tax and would not want to earn less at Spurs. A further complication is his image rights, which are expensive, as well as agents’ fees of up to £12m.Spurs are also one of the clubs who have been sounded out on whether they would be interested in signing Philippe Coutinho on loan. The Brazilian is considering a move away from Barcelona for the new season and the player’s representatives have made contact with several clubs, including Arsenal, to see whether there is any interest in the player who left Liverpool in January 2018 in a deal worth €142 million.Manchester United were also interested in signing Dybala this summer but walked away from the deal when the total cost became apparent. The Argentinian would prefer to stay at Juventus but the Italian champions are keen to offload him because of his high wages.The Tottenham manager, Mauricio Pochettino, is a huge admirer of Dybala but he too realises that it will be very difficult to get a deal over the line before Thursday’s deadline.Tottenham would have to sell Christian Eriksen, possibly to Manchester United, in order to finance the Dybala deal. Eriksen has just one year left on his contract and could leave for free next summer. Juventus are not interested in signing the Dane as any part of a deal for Dybala.Spurs have already broken their transfer record this summer with the signing of Tanguy Ndombele from Lyon for £55.5m. Despite this, Pochettino recently said that his job title should change from manager to coach as he has very little input into transfers.“The club need to change my title and description. Of course I am the boss deciding the strategic play, but in another area I don’t know. Today, I feel like I am the coach.”Tottenham start their Premier League campaign against Aston Villa on Saturday. The Premier League transfer window closes at 5pm on Thursday whereas Serie A clubs have until September 2 to conclude this summer’s business."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b43095e6b19ac006792a8dd0f33ceedae681fc35/0_745_7425_4456/master/7425.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3178d75d1f500243ec34a5582c388b31","title":"ayurvedic massage with sound therapy is this how it feels to be a posh pot noodle","story":"It is unlike anything I have ever experienced like being massaged from the insideSound massage? Sounds like woo-woo to me. I have been to a gong bath before, lying at the back of a sweaty studio for an hour, confused in the dark while a yogi fingered a large gong. It was a pleasant soundscape, but nothing more. I’d only gone because the event description promised participants would be wrapped in a carpet at the end, which sounded amazing when it came to it, we were told to cover our legs with a blanket in shavasana (AKA corpse pose) if we were chilly. I had pictured someone rolling me up like a cigarillo – not something a grown man can request with any dignity. I didn’t go back.Only fair to give it another go, this time one-on-one. Michelle Cade, the founder of Mind Like Water (£90 for 90 minutes) leads various sound therapies, and today I’m experiencing it with a full-body ayurvedic massage. I clamber on to the table, ungainly, clammy, full of unrelated anxieties. Luckily, Cade is an innately soothing presence. She is also a composer of binaural beats, and describes brain entrainment to me the theory by which brainwaves supposedly align with the frequency of a supplied beat. This allows you to shift your brainwaves to, say, a frequency associated with a meditative state. A nicer way of putting it than “getting mashed to a trippy jam”. I like jam. Thoughts like this wash through me and away.The transporting massage is intended to put me in an optimal state to receive the good vibrations, and it’s working. She sprinkles an ayurvedic powder over me like seasoning, works warm sesame oil into my legs. Is this is how it feels to be a posh Pot Noodle? Smells far nicer. She is burning resin to cleanse whatever energy is clearing my system. Essential oils twist through my brain: bergamot, peppermint, something … something.I wake myself up with the tickling graze of a light snore, dignity once again nowhere to be seen. Cade tells me that in sleep we access the delta brainwave, at which point internal healing can occur. It’s a nicer way of putting it than: “You fell asleep on the job, you worthless sack.” Now that I am totally relaxed – perhaps too much – it’s time for the sound portion of the therapy. Tibetan singing bowls are placed on my chest. Eyes closed, I feel their vibrato in my body as much as my ears. Cade has many instruments, most of which I can’t identify. She even sings at one point, so in tune with them that I’m not sure the tone is human.There’s a drum, more boom than volume, which reverberates pleasurably in my belly a particular soothing, shushing noise that makes me feel like a baby. I take a peek to find myself staring down the business end of a seeded baguette (which I’m later told is actually a rain stick). Most extraordinary of all: surgical-looking tuning forks, like something out of Marathon Man, placed at points around my head. I can feel their muscular thrum resonating against the walls of my skull, long after any audible noise has died away. It is like being massaged from the inside.This is what I didn’t understand before that sound therapy is about feeling, not hearing. Does it do any good? You have to believe in healing frequencies, which for many is a big ask. But you don’t need peer-reviewed science to know that relaxation feels nice, and is more healing than being majorly stressed out. I can’t think of another treatment as absurdly relaxing as this. The sound portion makes it more holistically sensual, every sense touched and calmed. Cade doesn’t wrap me up in a carpet (is my fantasy to be thrown into a boot, like a rival gangster in a Guy Ritchie film? Unclear), but I feel so much lighter. The day’s anxieties have evaporated. When I walk out, it is on a cloud. I don’t know if I should be banging the drum for sound therapy in general – I’m not sure how strongly the experience would have resonated without the massage. Yet I can’t deny it has done me a power of good. I sleep soundly that night, too – the best therapy of all.I’ve been caught napping in every job I’ve ever had.

The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, whose popularity has helped soften public perception of socialism though he is not directly involved with DSA , is a top-tier candidate for the 2020 Democratic nomination while Donald Trump is running for re-election on campaign slogans portraying socialism as a direct threat to America.The DSA, founded in 1982, has never had more of a national presence in US politics. Now, as socialism moves from the margins of American political life to the center of presidential politics, the movement faces a new and welcome challenge: where to go from here?“We’re not interested in losing and we’re not interested in performing our politics,” Maria Svart, DSA’s national director told the more than 1,000 democratic socialists who gathered in Atlanta last week for DSA’s largest-ever conference. “We’re here to win. And at a grand scale we want to transform society.”Over the course of four days, in a conference room at the Westin Peachtree Plaza, a unionized hotel in downtown Atlanta, members, ecstatic over their growing ranks and electoral victories, envisioned a society untethered from traditional capitalism. But more immediately, they debated strategy and structure. The isions over how DSA can best capitalize on a surge of interest echoed the central debate over the future of the Democratic party pitting pragmatism against ideological purity.“Right now so much is possible and it’s incredibly exciting,” said David Duhalde, the former deputy director of DSA who recently worked for the Sanders-aligned, Our Revolution. “But that also begets many, many more debates and questions about how we move forward and that is a great problem to have.”In a series of votes, members approved measures to prioritize electing democratic socialists at every level of government and to grow membership, currently at 56,000, to 100,000 while rejecting a proposal to adopt national political “litmus tests” for candidates. They will continue to run primary challenges against centrist Democrats and to organize low-income, working people, including in communities that voted for Trump.Amid much debate, DSA, which enthusiastically backed Sanders earlier this year, passed a resolution titled “In the event of a Sanders loss,” stipulating that the group would not formally endorse another Democratic presidential nominee if the Vermont senator does not win the primary. Members also voted to support the Green New Deal, universal childcare, the decriminalization of sex work and “open borders” –\u0026nbspa radical idea that goes far beyond what any Democratic presidential candidate would endorse. They also reaffirmed their support for the controversial Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement to protest against Israel’s treatment of Palestine and narrowly voted to establish an “anti-fascist working group”.But even for veterans, the hours-long debate – frequently interrupted by arcane procedural inquiries strictly governed by Robert’s Rules of Order – was a slog. Efforts to keep the discussion “comradely” by stifling side chatter and using gender-neutral terms drew snickers from conservative media.At one point during a back and forth over whether to expand the organization’s national staff, an irritated delegate stepped to the microphone to raise a point of order.“Can we please use ‘comrade’ as an honorific instead of ‘sir’ or ‘madam’?” the delegate asked tersely. The chair quickly apologized and thanked the “comrade” for raising the point.DSA’s numbers are relatively small, but its outsized impact on the conversation has caused a political headache for mainstream Democrats who reject any association with socialism.During the presidential debate in Detroit, centrist John Hickenlooper, the former governor of Colorado, said Sanders’ policies, including Medicare for All and a Green New Deal would be a “disaster at the ballot box”.“You might as well FedEx the election to Donald Trump,” he said.Not far from the Westin, where DSA members made plans to grow their ranks, Vice-President Mike Pence implored conservative youth to resist the “siren song of socialism”.“It’s not going to be enough just to win the next election,” he said at the Resurgent Gathering in Atlanta on Friday. “We got to win the next generation. We got to go tell the story to younger Americans about the truth – the truth about socialist policies.”But a May Gallup poll found an increasing number of Americans – four in 10 – believe some form of socialism would be good for the country, though more than half still disagree. At rallies and on social media, Trump has sought to portray all his Democrat adversaries as socialists intent on bringing “unAmerican”, European-style welfare programs across the Atlantic. These ideological attacks, which he has paired with racist and anti-immigrant rhetoric, are part of a political strategy to galvanize his core followers.“Trump is attacking us because the socialist movement offers an alternative vision to what he is offering, which is essentially neo-fascism,” said Svart, DSA’s national director. “He is threatened by us. And so are the Wall Street Democrats.”She continued: “What we’re saying as democratic socialists is that none of it has to be this way.”Most new DSA members are young, millennials who came of age during the global financial crisis, like Rachel Kahn. But the group’s numbers didn’t start to rise until Sanders ran for president in 2016.“He was the person who made me realize that I’m a socialist,” Kahn, 29, said on a break during the conference.Polling suggest that young people are increasingly disillusioned by capitalism and more open to socialism than previous generations. At the same time, young people are more likely to associate socialism with the Scandinavian-style social welfare state than with Soviet communism.Though it was her first time attending a DSA conference since she joined a local Atlanta chapter, Kahn spoke passionately on several resolutions, particularly those she thought might affect candidates in the south.On a question about litmus tests, she said forcing southern candidates to identify as “democratic socialists” would be a “death sentence”. The resolution failed.“People here are so institutionally primed to have a visceral, negative reaction to socialism,” she said. “If we want to win here,” she said afterward, “that might require molding ourselves to our environment a little bit and leading with our values instead.”khalid kamau, a member of the city council in South Fulton, Georgia, and first #BlackLivesMatter organizer elected to public office, told the conference: “We have to understand that us fringe people are future thinkers.”At a press conference later that weekend, he joined nearly two dozen locally elected democratic socialists, including from traditionally Republican areas. The slate included Ruth Buffalo, a Native American representative in North Dakota who ousted the sponsor of the state’s ID law, Mik Pappas, a district judge in Pennsylvania who has sought to end cash bail in his court, and a contingent of the six democratic socialists recently elected to Chicago’s 50-member city council.“It’s a recognition that capitalism has failed us,” Gabriel Acevero, who was elected to the Maryland state house of delegates in 2018, said of their growing ranks in elected office. “Capitalism has failed working people. Capitalism has failed oppressed people and capitalism has failed our planet. And I think more and more people are coming to that realization.”Near the end of a long day of debate, cheers rang out in the conference room. Sean Parker, a democratic socialist in Nashville, had just won a seat on the city council."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3faa20e12b972fe686c36a058e21610adbb8787a/429_890_2649_1590/master/2649.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e722116f647c212182cdb10c49241e8f","title":"john mcdonnell open to second scottish independence vote","story":"Shadow chancellor contradicts Labour policy, suggesting party should not block referendumJohn McDonnell has said Labour should allow Holyrood to stage a second independence referendum if MSPs vote for one, contradicting party policy.The shadow chancellor told an event at the Edinburgh festival fringe that his party should not try to block a second vote on independence by withholding the legal powers to do so.Interviewed by the broadcaster Iain Dale, McDonnell said: “We would not block something like that. We would let the Scottish people decide. That’s democracy.”McDonnell admitted Labour was split on the issue, but implied the UK leadership agreed. “There are other views within the party, but that’s our view,” he said.Under section 30 of the Scotland Act, Holyrood could only hold one if it is given the power to do so by the UK government.The Conservative government has repeatedly refused to give it such authority, but the Brexit crisis and the growing prospects of an early general election has brought the question to the fore.Jeremy Corbyn, the UK Labour leader and a close ally of McDonnell, has repeatedly wavered on the issue, but has said that if he became prime minister the party would “decide at the time” on whether to authorise a vote.Corbyn added, however: “We don’t want another referendum, we don’t think another referendum is a good idea, and we’ll be very clear on why we don’t think it’s a good idea.”McDonnell contradicted that stance, telling Dale: “It will be for the Scottish parliament and the Scottish people to decide that. They will take a view about whether they want another referendum. Nicola Sturgeon said by late next year or the beginning of 2021.“The Scottish parliament will come to a considered view on that and they will submit that to the government and the English parliament itself.”Ian Murray, a Scottish Labour MP and critic of independence and Corbyn, accused McDonnell of an “utterly irresponsible thoughtless rant” that betrayed the party’s values.“The Labour party is an internationalist party founded on a vision of solidarity and we should never seek to appease nationalists, whether they be for Brexit or Scottish independence, who want to ide communities and people,” he said.“John McDonnell has even bought into the nationalist narrative that Westminster is an ‘English parliament’, in an insult to the hard work carried out by Scottish MPs from every party.”Corbyn’s Scottish advisers have insisted he would not do a deal with the Scottish National party by offering them a second referendum in exchange for supporting a minority Labour government at Westminster. The SNP, however, are certain to put that on the table if Labour fails to win an overall majority.McDonnell said Labour would not do any deals with other parties, including the SNP. “I think we’d form a minority government, seek to implement our manifesto and we’d expect the other opposition parties and other MPs to vote for those policies and if they don’t we’ll go back to the country.”According to those polling figures, it is highly unlikely Labour would win enough Scottish Westminster seats to command a Commons majority. Blocking a second referendum could cost Labour significant votes in Scotland, which may explain McDonnell’s new approach.His critics argue that supporting a new referendum will hand tens of thousands of unionist votes to the Scottish Tories, who will make opposition to independence the defining issue of their general election campaign.Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, responded to McDonnell’s remarks by tweeting:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc9ed445d22b48201772757bc4033f8da6397b75/0_7_3731_2238/master/3731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac03df123c67314441d487aded99fba1","title":"michael gove accuses eu of refusing to negotiate new deal","story":"Ireland warns on relations as Boris Johnson’s government seems intent on no-deal departureMichael Gove has accused the European Union of intransigence over Brexit talks, calling it “wrong and sad”, as isions between the UK and Brussels became further entrenched with the government seemingly intent on a no-deal departure.Gove, who is in charge of no-deal preparations, reiterated Boris Johnson’s position that the only route to progress would be the EU starting again with withdrawal negotiations, something Brussels has repeatedly and consistently ruled out.Adding to the impression of Johnson’s hardening position, newly released government read-outs of the prime minister’s phone calls with a series of EU leaders over recent days showed he delivered the same uncompromising message to them.While the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, insisted on Tuesday that a no-deal departure was not inevitable, both he and the country’s finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, warned of a significant and long-term change to relations between the countries if it did happen.Downing Street has increasingly pushed the message that Brexit will happen on 31 October under any circumstances – even intimating that No 10 believes the mandate of the 2016 Brexit referendum would overrule even a blocking vote in parliament.There is increasing worry among some MPs that Johnson could try to force through a no-deal Brexit against the will of the Commons, with his de facto chief of staff, Dominic Cummings, reportedly threatening No 10 staff with the sack if they dissent.The government’s official position is still that it is seeking a formalised departure, albeit only if Brussels ditches the Irish backstop border insurance policy and reopens the withdrawal agreement.While the terms of the Brexit extension to 31 October made it plain neither could happen, Gove pushed the UK government’s view that if there is no deal it will be due to EU intransigence.“We need a new approach and we stand ready to engage with the European Union, to negotiate in good faith to make sure that we can have a friendly relationship in the future,” Gove said.“We will put all our energy into making sure that we can secure that good deal but at the moment it is the EU that seems to be saying they are not interested. They are simply saying: ‘No, we don’t want to talk.’ I think that is wrong and sad. It is not in Europe’s interests.”The official No 10 records of Johnson’s recent calls with EU leaders were similarly robust. In calls with Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Swedish prime minister, Stefan Löfven, Johnson said Theresa May’s old withdrawal agreement must be scrapped.In conversations with Juncker and Löfven, Johnson referred to “the anti-democratic backstop”, Downing Street’s new chosen form of words for a policy negotiated jointly by the UK and EU.Varadkar, speaking on a visit to Hillsborough Castle in Northern Ireland, said he still held out hopes of an agreement. “I don’t accept it’s unavoidable,” he said of no deal.“There are many ways by which a no-deal Brexit can be avoided. Either by the ratification of the withdrawal agreement, a further extension or revocation of article 50. So, there are a number of ways that a no deal can be avoided on 31 of October. I am certainly not fatalistic about that.”Varadkar warned, however, that no deal would merely mark the start of a new set of negotiations between the UK and EU, on everything from citizens’ rights to the “orce” settlement and the Irish border.Donohoe was blunter still following a meeting in London with his UK counterpart, the chancellor, Sajid Javid, warning that the relationship between the UK and Ireland would “fundamentally change” in the event of no deal. reported on Monday that Brussels diplomats briefed on a meeting between senior EU figures and Boris Johnson’s chief envoy had been told a no-deal Brexit was the UK’s “central scenario” and that Downing Street would not countenance any discussions involving the backstop.﻿Conservative rebels are plotting to stop Johnson and Gove pursuing a no-deal Brexit by trying to bring down the government in a confidence motion. This would give them 14 days to form a new government of “national unity” composed of those opposed to hard Brexit to prevent a crash-out on 31 October.However, Labour appeared to stymie that proposal on Tuesday. Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, told Channel 4 News the party “wouldn’t countenance a national government of unity” to deal with Brexit.“What we don’t want is a national unity government that gives Boris some sort of get-out-of-jail-free card,” she said, suggesting Labour would prefer an election.If no government of national unity is formed within 14 days of a lost confidence vote, an election would be called.Cummings has indicated he believes that in such a scenario the prime minister could plough on with a no-deal Brexit and call an election for after the UK has left the EU on 31 October.One of the Tory rebels, Dominic Grieve, told Channel 4 News the Queen would have to step in to “sack” Johnson if he refused to go after losing a confidence vote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7250570f0800c49fa11de6c38ac4453d585ea46/33_343_4149_2490/master/4149.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acb434e772675253a00b5b392469d2e7","title":"khadijah mellah glorious goodwood horse racing hijab","story":"The 18-year-old from Brixton has been inundated with support since becoming the first jockey to race in Britain wearing a hijab and moreover to winFive days after Khadijah Mellah had her headline-grabbing moment in the charity race at Glorious Goodwood she has not quite returned to earth. “It’s basically taken over my life,” she said on Tuesday, during one of many interviews, demand for which reflects the worldwide interest in the previously unknown 18-year-old from Brixton who won a race at the famously tricky circuit mere months after climbing aboard a racehorse for the first time.Khadijah became the first jockey to ride in – and win – a race in Britain wearing a hijab. The job of steering Haverland to glory in the Magnolia Cup took not much more than a minute. It is a minute that Khadijah has been reliving endlessly since.“I’ve spent a lot of time talking to people about my race, it’s been a busy few days. I’ve been trying to take it all in, to be fair.”Her mood appears to be happy but on the edge of worn out. Certainly Haverland has never faced such a test of stamina as his rider is now tackling. Great British Racing, the sport’s promotional wing, has struggled to keep track of the media interest but has so far logged more than 1,000 TV broadcasts and online pieces on top of the print coverage that had Khadijah on front pages on Friday.She has made the news in France, Turkey, Australia, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and South Africa. In this country ITV has given the green light to a documentary about her journey in horse racing, to be called Riding A Dream and due on screens in the autumn.Khadijah radiates a sense of unreality that any of this is happening to her, as well she may. In January, impending A level exams were the biggest thing in her calendar, before the ITV Racing presenter Oli Bell, a patron of the Ebony Riding School in Brixton where she occasionally rode, started to think she might be a suitable candidate for an ambitious project.One of the wholly unexpected consequences was that Khadijah found herself at the annual Regency Ball at Goodwood House on Thursday night, mixing with the rich and famous and being introduced to the singer Ellie Goulding. “It was amazing, so grand.”She takes as much relish in the pleasure last week’s success gave to those around her. “My parents have been really happy, completely over the moon for me. They’ve been posting and sharing every single article there is about me. They didn’t initially think I could do it, so me winning was a massive thing.“My friends and family and even distant relatives and friends I haven’t been in contact with for ages have all been messaging me: ‘I’ve just seen you, congratulations!’ My primary school teacher contacted me, I hadn’t spoken to in, like, 10 years.”Speaking earlier, on the Good Morning Britain sofa, she had said: “I can’t wait to hear a success story where someone says, actually Khadijah Mellah’s been a role model to me.” It might be that such a person shares a roof with her as her younger brother Abdus, now 16, has hopes of making it as a jockey and could apply for an amateur’s licence as early as next year.Khadijah’s story is a gift for a sport anxious to expand its horizons, as is readily acknowledged by Rose Grissell, who joined the British Horseracing Authority last year as head of ersity and inclusion. Noting that Khadijah was the first jockey to wear a hijab while riding in a race in Britain, Grissell says: “When you get the first of anything, it really helps people to imagine the world differently and inspires people to defy expectations about how things can change and what the world should look like.“I think her success will inspire many different types of people, and not just now but also in future years, whether that’s as a woman, a young woman, a woman of colour or a Muslim, or people from a similar background, growing up in an urban area. To achieve what she did in such a short space of time was really incredible.“Obviously there’s a lot of work to do but I think it will definitely have an impact. She’s getting exposure much wider beyond racing, which demonstrates that we are an inclusive sport, we welcome everyone, from whatever background. We’re one of the few sports where you can have not only men and women competing against each other but also people with a variety of different disabilities as well.“We really are an inclusive sport and Khadijah’s success helped us spread that message far and wide. The hope is that people who may not have thought racing is for them, or who may not have had any knowledge of racing, may think differently now.“This is an ongoing focus, something that’s going to take a long time, to position racing as a sport for everybody and to reach out to different communities that we’re currently not reaching.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ee27b5fed4f319eeb1c73f2051d4199dbf51041/0_98_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=751e4564d69b00db2b9dc8eec2ba67c3","title":"tour de pologne suspends racing tribute bjorg lambrecht","story":"Racing in the Tour de Pologne was suspended on Tuesday, as cycling paid tribute to the life of Bjorg Lambrecht, who died after a crash on Monday.Lambrecht’s Lotto-Soudal teammates came across the finish line together in a neutralised fourth stage, one also specially adapted to pay tribute to the Belgian rider.The stage began with a minute’s silence and it was followed by another at 48.5km, the distance at which Lambrecht had crashed the previous day. The 22-year-old is understood to have fallen into a concrete culvert during the third stage, from Chorzow to Zabrze.Riders from different teams, all wearing black armbands, took it in turn to lead the stage before ceding to the Lotto-Soudal riders. They came together to approach the finish before stepping off their bikes with 50 feet remaining and observing a third minute’s silence. Eventually, they crossed through a black finishing arch, which also featured Lambrecht’s name and his race number, 143.Lotto-Soudal afterwards paid their own tribute to Lambrecht. “During the 2016 cycling season, as a first year U23, everybody was talking about Bjorg, within and also outside the peloton. Words like ‘pocket climber’, ‘rough diamond’, ‘puncher’, ‘Grand Tour hope’ were used,” the team said in a statement.“With playful determination, he integrated into the world of professional cycling. Teammates and staff appreciated his work ethic and humility, opponents discovered his talent, and the media appreciated his nuanced but clear story.“All riders and staff of Lotto-Soudal would sincerely like to thank everybody for their expressions of sympathy in the usually hard top-level sports world. But in the first place, our thoughts go out to the parents, family and friends of Bjorg, who have to endure the greatest burden, a life without Bjorg.”Lambrecht is the second professional rider to die this year after the Dutchman Robbert de Greef suffered a cardiac arrest in the Omloop van de Braakman. In June, the multiple Tour de France winner Chris Froome also suffered serious injury after a high-speed crash while on a reconnoitre of a stage in the Critérium du Dauphiné."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcbf2f28ef125751ee342555fb6dc477be40d653/0_86_1739_1043/master/1739.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05f38348216369cd90073cc6f8c789b3","title":"steve smith hundreds england women consolation and pavel florin the spin podcast cricket","story":"Emma John is joined by Adam Collins, comedian Felicity Ward and broadcaster Toby Tarrant to look back at Australia’s victory in the first Ashes Test, which featured a historic brace of centuries from crowd villain Steve Smith.

However, this luxury is not given to Test cricketers – even in the post free-to-air era. Moeen Ali is rediscovering this after his moon ball, his misguided leave and his wayward second-innings bowling at Edgbaston so, too, is Jason Roy, who swung and missed so memorably when producing a poor imitation of Virender Sehwag at the crease. Playing international cricket is a great job it is also a cruel one.It is an easier game in the press box. In my eagerness to feel some empathy with a few of our Test players, let me admit to splitting an infinitive in 2001 and more recently, just before the start of the first Test against Australia in a typical bit of journalistic smart-arsery, there was this pontification: “If England can get to 80 for two on a regular basis they will win the series.” Well, at Edgbaston England were 154 for one at the high point of their first innings and 80 for two in their second. They ended up being thrashed by 251 runs.The game can make fools of us all. Three weeks after their World Cup win England’s cricketers are being castigated Steve Smith, a pariah in his own country not so long ago, is now canonised. And there are still four Tests to go. None of us is safe. If England score more runs than Australia on a regular basis, they might win the series.Suddenly there is gloom and despondency. Only twice since 1954-55 have England won an Ashes series after losing the first Test and that happened in the miraculous years of 1981 and 2005. Before the contest resumes next Wednesday at Lord’s the England selectors have some agonising to do, not over whether to make changes but on how many would be appropriate.It is clear that Jimmy Anderson will be missing, probably for the rest of the series, possibly for the rest of time. Jofra Archer is primed to take his place. Until Tuesday against Gloucestershire’s second XI he had not bowled with a red ball – and therefore had not delivered more than 10 overs in a day – since last September. He is a brilliant prospect but expectations of him should be measured.The same applies to Jack Leach, if he is selected to replace Moeen. There is a fair chance this will happen. Everyone wants Moeen to succeed. He is the most endearing and dependable of characters, who gives so much to the squad around the dressing room, where he is a rock‑solid presence. Yet on the field the opposite applies at the moment. There is no knowing what he is going to do. He cut a forlorn figure at Edgbaston. He bowled more than adequately in the first innings but his inability to put pressure on the Australia batsmen on Saturday night and Sunday morning when conditions were helpful for finger spinners was critical and soon to be highlighted by Nathan Lyon’s performance on the final day.The recall of Leach would not be a cast-iron solution. In the past month he has bowled three overs for 26 runs against Ireland. This is not the ideal workload going into a vital Ashes Test – though this situation will be exacerbated to a far greater extent next summer, when the middle three months of the season will be dominated by the T20 Blast and the Hundred. One imagines the ECB has thought of that but prefers the money. So Leach is hardly in the groove – and the same would apply to any batsman Ed Smith might like to draft into his squad.There is another snag. The Australia top six contains four left-handers, which encourages the selection of an off-spinner. The advent of the DRS leads to so many lbws for the finger spinner turning the ball away from the bat and that threat changes how the batsmen play. The stats demonstrate that the off-spinners, Lyon and Moeen, are much more effective against left-handed batsmen and that was confirmed at Edgbaston – when Lyon was bowling. Leach, a left-armer, is the obvious option to replace Moeen, given there is a dearth of credible off-spinning candidates, but he is not the ideal one.There will also be discussions about England’s batting. The middle order, an area where England were supposed to be superior, did not fire in the first Test, with Jos Buttler and Jonny Bairstow both looking out of sorts. However, it is highly unlikely that England will dispense with them so early in the series, especially since any potential replacements are currently contemplating how to clear the nearest boundary."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6851d768038db19cbc7abe367355192ce3c1e47/0_43_625_375/master/625.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=60774d90f248b11159f160443b5564a6","title":"all of me review summerhall edinburgh festival 2019","story":"Summerhall, EdinburghThough it is unashamedly bleak, there are fragments of brightness as Caroline Horton’s show recognises mental health as something that ebbs and flowsCaroline Horton opens her new show with an apology. Several apologies, in fact. You’re not supposed to start a performance by saying sorry, she acknowledges, it tends to make audience members uncomfortable. But then again, All of Me is not all that interested in setting spectators at ease.Nothing about depression – the subject of Horton’s show – is comfortable or crowd-pleasing. All of Me used to be one kind of show about depression, Horton explains: a lighter, more hopeful kind of show – a bit like Mess, Horton’s playful piece about her experience of anorexia. But during the making of this show, Horton became ill again. So now All of Me is unashamedly bleak, resisting the redemptive narrative arc that is so often expected from plays about mental health.Confronting the darkness that can make death seem welcoming, Horton takes us on a journey to the underworld. Her depression is interwoven with myth, switching abruptly from ancient narrative to everyday hopelessness. One moment, Horton is approaching s of the underworld the next, she’s lying on the floor in unwashed clothes, unable to get up. Through layers of storytelling, song and looped sound we hear the overwhelming noise of despair – as well as its occasional absurdity.It’s messy. It could hardly be otherwise. And, perhaps more surprisingly, it’s beautiful. The underworld as evoked by Horton is as seductive as it is haunting. The dim lighting bounces off a pair of glitterballs, sending fragments of brightness into the gloom. Horton, a deathly figure in a towering headdress, sings a melancholy tune that lingers in the ear. So much about depression is ugly or simply blank, but Horton is able to find a strange sort of magnificence in the darkness.There’s also a fierce political edge to All of Me. Through its non-linear structure, it pushes back against society’s desire for quick fixes. The show, with its loops and echoes, recognises mental health as something that ebbs and flows – as well as something that responds to the society we live in. If we want to hear fewer stories about mental illness, Horton suggests, we need to “unfuck the world”.• Read all our Edinburgh festival reviews"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/01749eb7f3dfd6e1ea3200bdbcca4a31f9a9bd9c/0_92_5408_3246/master/5408.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e53def98548fe5e9614db2f28c1a55c4","title":"8chan owner statement jim watkins","story":"Jim Watkins defended website amid growing outcry over reports the alleged El Paso gunman used the site to publish his manifestoThe owner of the extremist message board 8chan broke his silence on Tuesday in a defensive video statement that attempted to deflect blame for the role the platform plays in disseminating hate speech and inciting violence by lashing out at service providers, journalists and Instagram.Jim Watkins, a US military veteran who lives in the Philippines, defended the website amid growing outcry over reports that the alleged El Paso gunman, as well as several other mass shooting suspects, used the site to publish white nationalist manifestos ahead of violent attacks.“My company takes a firm stand on helping law enforcement, and within minutes of these two tragedies, we were working with FBI agents to find out what information we could to help in their investigations,” Watkins said, in a lengthy statement read over the sounds of the military bugle call Taps as he sat before a backdrop of Benjamin Franklin. “We have never protected illegal speech, as it seems that we have been accused of by some less than credible journalists”, he added.Watkins went on to denounce as “cowardly” the decision of infrastructure provider Cloudflare to stop providing 8chan with its services on Sunday, a move that has jeopardized 8chan’s ability to stay on the open internet. After Cloudflare cut ties, other service providers followed suit on Monday on Tuesday, a version of the site was available, but with severely limited functionality.Watkins also alleged without providing any evidence that a different internet platform was involved in the El Paso massacre.“First of all, the El Paso shooter posted on Instagram, not 8chan,” he said. “Later someone uploaded a manifesto. However, that manifesto was not uploaded by the Walmart shooter. I don’t know if he wrote it or not, but it was not uploaded by the murderer.”A spokeswoman for Instagram said the company has “found nothing to support this theory”. The suspect’s Instagram had not been used in more than a year when it was deactivated on Saturday, she said, and Instagram has been cooperating with law enforcement. The Cloudflare chief executive, Matthew Prince, also confirmed on Sunday that the company had seen evidence that the manifesto was uploaded to 8chan prior to the attack.The claim has nevertheless been repeated as fact by various rightwing pundits on Twitter.Attempts to derail a conversation or muddy the waters with specious allegations are the lingua franca of Watkins’ site, where racist and homophobic slurs are common and anonymous users delight in the shocking and obscene.As major internet platforms try to halt the dissemination of toxic content, Watkins’ site has become an essential tool for those trying to spread it.When Ted Kaczynski, the terrorist and triple murderer known as the “Unabomber”, wanted the world to read his thoughts, he demanded that the New York Times and Washington Post publish his 35,000 word “manifesto” or he would send a bomb “with intent to kill”. The newspapers weighed the decision for three months, despite the threat. When they finally decided to publish at the recommendation of the US attorney general and Federal Bureau of Investigation, the terrorist screed was packaged with context and analysis.Twenty-four years later, white nationalist terrorists can skip the blackmail and go directly to 8chan to attain notoriety, spread their ideas and inspire copycats. In the first 24 hours after the live-streamed massacre of 51 Muslim worshippers in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March, Facebook removed 1.5m copies of the video.8chan was founded in 2013 by Fredrick Brennan as an even less restrictive alternative to another notorious message board, 4chan. The site’s popularity exploded in 2014 when 4chan banned discussion of the misogynistic harassment campaign known as Gamergate, prompting a migration of 4chan’s most committed harassers to the newer forum.Brennan and Watkins started working together in 2014, according to a profile by Fusion. Watkins had learned computer skills in the US army, and while serving in the military made money with a side business – a pornography site and web hosting services catering to adult Japanese sites.He left the army in 1998 and his company, NT Technology, began hosting the popular Japanese message board that inspired 4chan, 2channel, two years later. Watkins eventually took control of that site in 2014. That same year, he offered his assistance to Brennan, who been struggling to keep 8chan functioning. Brennan moved to the Philippines to work with Watkins, who eventually took ownership of 8chan, too.Brennan stopped working for 8chan in 2016 and cut ties in 2018.Brennan has called for the site to be shut down in a number of interviews since the El Paso shooting, arguing that Watkins has failed to manage the site responsibly and even encouraged extremism with decisions such as running the tagline “Embrace infamy” on the site’s homepage. In the past, Brennan had cheered the site’s involvement in harassment campaigns.  has contacted Brennan and Watkins for comment.On Monday, Brennan tweeted: “The only ones who will suffer from 8chan going down are mass shooters who planned to use it as a platform and Jim Watkins.”Watkins’ problems now go beyond his service providers. On Tuesday, the chairman and ranking member of the House committee on homeland security wrote to Watkins demanding that he “provide testimony regarding 8chan’s efforts to investigate and mitigate the proliferation of extremist content, including white supremacist extremist content, on your website”.“Americans deserve to know what, if anything, you, as the owner and operator, are doing to address the proliferation of extremist content on 8chan,” representatives Bennie Thompson and Mike Rogers wrote."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16dad25eb007cb21e8736ff0e2a4b875eeb3b3bf/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d4683ecbb8fbacb4326141df4bd5558","title":"how much does google know about you podcast","story":"Alex Hern on how Google’s use of personal data has potentially helped create a new age of mass surveillance.

Three creatives explain how their old man has inspired them throughout their livesThere are few experiences more bonding than sharing a drink with your dad. Over a glass, or two, of Tobermory 12 Year Old whisky, a writer, photographer and magazine journalist, give a frank glimpse into their relationships with the men who raised themWhen I first told my dad about the subject of this piece, how his creativity has inspired my writing, he responded with the traditional Druker facial expression (somewhere between a sneer and a shrug).“Pheh,” he said. “It doesn’t even inspire me.”It’s taken us a long while to get to this point, sat across a table from each other, talking like a pair of adults. Mostly over coffee. Occasionally something stronger.My dad has a huge personality, but he’s not a big drinker. Two wine gums and a glass of water and he’s pissed, he says. I used to drink a bit too much. Now we meet somewhere in the middle. We used to be too different, too much the same to do this. We had rows, we didn’t get on. But times change. Times change people. And now we have moments.My dad retired around the time I was stumbling into adulthood. After a life of work and activism, he took up creative pursuits, playing in bands and DJing world music, funk and jump blues, expanding on his lifelong passion for music. As funny as he is, he takes it all very seriously.I notice the ways I’m like him, now. And the ways I want to be like him. He’s probably the funniest person I know. Cutting, absurdist and lightning quick. He’s got a sharp reply before you’ve finished talking. And when chatter falls to quiet, he’ll point strangers out, invent stories about them, tell me who they’ve just had a row with.He’s also a walking encyclopedia for film, music and literature. Pick out an old soul single and he’ll tell you who played bass on the B-side.His morality is like a lodestone to me. My understanding of the world was forged by anti-apartheid fundraisers, picket lines and marches before I could walk, and it’s informed by him to this day.It’s only now, as I pick it all apart, I realise how much of him is in everything I write. Sometimes behind the words on the page or the mouths of characters. Sometimes just kibitzing in my ear, telling me to lighten up and try putting a joke in for once.So now we have fleeting moments of connection I treasure. Something he never got to do with his dad. Something that will always be with me.He can also be a bit of a putz, to be fair.My dad and I haven’t always gotten on, with my stubborn teenage behaviour and his old-fashioned views. But as my mum doesn’t really drink, my dad had someone to share a tipple with when I started drinking. Even now when I go home he jokingly asks when I’m moving back to be his drinking buddy. We found out about one another’s likes, pet peeves and favourite drinks (mine: tequila, his: whisky). I got to know about his fascinating life and him as a person, rather than just my dad. You think you would know these things about your parent, but over a drink, this authority figure fades and a friend emerges.Being someone who studied fashion and has always been obsessed with clothes, we often find ourselves chatting about the topic. You’d never know to look at him in his home-knitted vests, but my 76-year-old dad was quite the fashionista back in the day! He showed me his old Dior suits, bought with his first paychecks, and that ignited my interest in vintage fashion – which was a step outside of all my high-fashion magazines. I make my own clothes as much as possible, and when video-calling my seamstress of a mum for help, my dad is often in the background ready to pipe in with some advice – a longer hem, more fitted, a different button – and I hate to admit it, but a lot of the time he’s spot on.I know every child says this, but my dad is one of the best cooks on this earth (owning a successful takeaway for 20 years might have something to do with it). But one thing that’s certain to come up when we meet up is talk about food. I’m always bugging him about how he made a dish while I ply him with a drink, hoping for him to spill his secrets. As someone who could only boil pasta when I left home, I now make dishes from around the world. My love for cooking and fascination for flavours is down to him.I’m now an entertainment journalist at a leading women’s magazine. He may not know the people I write about in my job, but he’s always been supportive of me and keen to learn more about the industry I’m in. It wasn’t easy to get into, and I know that my perseverance in my career is the same as my dad’s “never quit” work ethic that got him from Hong Kong to the UK in his 20s, and got him his successful business after many less successful ones. And that’s certainly something to say cheers to.My dad, David, inspired my passion for both photography and Scotland – which I’ve had a lifelong love affair with.He’s Scottish, in fact he’s very Scottish – he’d play the bagpipes at my school and my two brothers and I would often wear kilts – but his work as a doctor meant I was born and raised in the East Midlands, which is billiard table flatness.When we would visit my granny in Forres as a kid my brain would be absolutely fried by the beauty of the place, I just always had an affinity and always felt Scottish – although when I moved there when I was 18 I was constantly and very much reminded that I wasn’t!My parents enrolled me at the Findhorn Foundation in Forres, which is a spiritual community, where I did something called the Youth Programme, which enabled me to develop my photography and led to my career, and had me moving back to Scotland as soon as I could.Dad loves my work and is so proud. He was an amateur photographer and had a dark room at our home, and I used his Rolleiflex as my first camera I’ve been lucky to have a dad who is so supportive.My two brothers are very academic, and obviously my dad is too, being a doctor – plus my grandparents were doctors, so I had a lot of pressure to “do something”. I’m dyslexic, and at school I just wasn’t academic, so photography really opened up so much.The Isle of Mull is both one of my and my dad’s favourite places in Scotland, and I love exploring every nook and cranny with my camera. It’s incredible and erse, a bit like a mini Scotland in one. It’s mountainous and moory and it has breathtaking beaches.It’s wild but it’s got towns like Tobermory where there’s theatre, and there’s a real sense of community about it, yet it still has this complete remoteness, which is what I love most about it.And of course, there’s the distillery in Tobermory. The whisky somehow manages to taste like Mull by encapsulating its myriad qualities. It’s beautiful, peaty and completely an island whisky.To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/201ace3264e351852ddc37b2caf8d221e226139c/0_183_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f854a9ea52e0562728cd544bf21105b3","title":"whisky business how do you drink yours","story":"For too long a snobbery has lingered over how best to consume whisky. Can there really be a right – or wrong – way to enjoy your favourite malt?It can often seem as if there are only two schools of thought when it comes to how you should enjoy your whisky. Some treat the drink with an almost austere reverence, insisting that it should only be taken neat or with just a touch of water – maybe, at a pinch, with an ice cube or two. Others, which in reality means most people who enjoy a tipple every now and then, are happy to mix it to taste with whatever works for them, use it as a base for a cocktail, or simply sip it from a mighty tumbler towering with ice.But is there a right way to drink whisky? It might be that you can do whatever you want with the house blend down at your local pub, but what about something more refined – in other words, what about a single malt?For the uninitiated, the distinction between a blend and a single malt is a fairly easy one to mark out. A scotch blend is simply a mixture of grain and malt whiskies from two or more distilleries. A single malt, on the other hand, is nothing more and nothing less than a whisky from a single distillery, bottled and sold as a whisky from a single distillery.But, of course, things are always a little more complicated than that. Blends are sometimes thought to be inferior to their single malt cousins, and while this is by no means a settled question, it is true that they don’t quite inspire the same scholarly devotion as single malts. So, while plenty of whisky purists may have no problem with you topping up an inexpensive blend with a yard of Coke, they’re likely to take a less charitable view of you doing the same with their favourite malt.Luckily, there is an answer to all of this.“It really just depends on what you’re looking for,” says Kirstie McCallum, senior blender at Distell International, which owns and produces Tobermory. “For me there’s a real difference between wanting to sit there and appreciate a whisky for all its flavours and complexity, and just actually wanting to sit there and enjoy a drink with friends.“If I want to appreciate all the flavours in a whisky and appreciate that maturation and the work that’s gone into it I love it with just a wee touch of water to open it up,” she says. “Then just sip it, let it rest in your mouth a bit so that you get a proper chance to take in all of the flavours. At the same time, if you’re just sitting around having a drink with your friends, do whatever you want with it.”McCallum’s refreshingly unpretentious take is rooted in her view that whisky – and that includes single malts – is on the whole a social, relaxed drink. That means there is plenty of room at the table both for those who want to contemplate their whisky – either neat or, as she prefers it, with a touch of water – and those who want to let their hair down a bit more.“I think for too long whisky has been seen as kind of standoffish,” she says. “There’s always been this view of whisky that it’s maybe a bit like how people see wine – they worry about not knowing what to ask for or about getting it wrong somehow. But whisky shouldn’t be like that at all, because it’s a drink for everybody.“We make the whisky for people to drink it, and whatever you like adding to it, as long as you enjoy it that’s how you should drink it,” says McCallum. “The great thing is that whisky is just such a versatile drink. You can do cocktails with whisky, you can do long drinks, or you can have a nice single malt with water.”With that in mind, McCallum suggests a number of tantalising options for enjoying Tobermory 12 Year Old. “I think with Tobermory being such a citrusy, caramelly, kind of sweet whisky, it mixes well with something that’s nice and light and fresh,” she says.“It works really well as a long mixed drink with lots of ice. I’d recommend trying it that way with either ginger ale or some fresh apple juice,” she says.On the cocktail front, McCallum says that the citrus and caramel notes of Tobermory 12 Year Old are particularly complemented by berry flavours – so a Scotch bramble, or perhaps a malt old fashioned with a blueberry garnish, could be well worth trying.“For me, whisky is a very personal drink,” she says. “I drink my whisky and it’s about memories of being places and being with friends – it’s not about ‘you can’t do this and you can’t do that’. In the end, it’s about enjoying it on your own terms – do whatever you want with it.”To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/869bea2efbe1e61d2a9537d6caf41dae7f5dde0b/0_8_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea0bf1a4eb9728648d29180166761513","title":"blue hags and spanish booty the legends of mull","story":"Tales of witches and doomed pipers, plus the promise of hidden treasures beneath the waves, fuel a creative spirit on the Isle of Mull that expresses itself through music, art and whiskyVisitors to the Isle of Mull – Scotland’s fourth-biggest island – are mesmerised by its many treasures. Everyone who lives here – be they artists, musicians or whisky makers – lives in symbiosis with their surroundings, feeding off the folklore embedded in the island’s soul.The story of MacKinnon’s Cave, said to be one of the deepest sea caves in the Hebrides, will chill the heart of many a musician. A piper who was walking his dog in the cave came to a sticky end when a female ogre (or fairy, depending on your folklore source) became unimpressed with his performance. The dog survived, but emerged crazed and hairless with fright. Some claim to have seen the doomed bald canine walking along the top of the caves – and if you’re brave enough to go inside, his harrowing howls can apparently be heard whistling in the wind.Then there’s the ancient Lochbuie stone circle: nine granite rocks that sit silently in their own natural amphitheatre, overlooked by the slopes of Ben Buie. Although most visitors find it a place of tranquility, legend has it that the area is haunted.More chilling still is the tale of idyllic Loch Ba, reputed home to Cailleach Bheur, one of Scotland’s most powerful witches. Once every 100 years, before any other creature had awoken, the blue-faced old hag would submerge herself in the water of the loch, and be transformed into an enchanting beauty. The spell was broken by the bark of a dog who had awoken before she’d finished bathing. The witch, also known as the queen of winter, is said to have created the beautiful rolling hills on the isle by striding across the land and dropping rocks from her basket to form her own stepping stones.The sporadic appearance of valuable artefacts in Tobermory Bay, meanwhile, have convinced many that a sunken Spanish ship from 1588 – either the Florencia or the San Juan de Sicilia – lurks beneath the waves. Having fled the Channel in the wake of the Armada’s defeat, it’s thought to have sunk in the bay, taking its rumoured cargo of £300,000 of gold bullion – which would now fetch more than £30m – with it.There are more riches in the bay than Spanish booty, however. In a town built as a fishing port – that has since developed an acclaimed arts scene, with its own gallery and theatre group – one thing you can count on is fresh seafood the many quaint restaurants and pubs serve crustaceans that go from boat to plate in minutes.You could even be lucky enough to see dolphins, whales and basking sharks just off the shore. Golden and white-tailed eagles have also made this picturesque island their home, as have otters and an abundance of other birds and mammals.The island is also home to the famous Tobermory Distillery, established in 1798. One of Scotland’s oldest distilleries (and the only one on the island), it produces single malts with a captivating charm that are expressive by nature and inspired by the bright, Instagram-perfect buildings that line the waterfront.With its kaleidoscope of colour, culture, wildlife, eerie legends and fine local whisky, Mull could be the place for you to conjure up your own story.To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers, visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0906989d31801805269a34044c1e5ab035c3473d/0_301_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c9884a160598e5d69047ea04285ad74","title":"10 open air theatres uk visit public transport minack cornwall","story":"Our pick of non-London venues present outdoor summer shows in locations from Cornwall’s coastal Minack to Glasgow’s wooded Greenbank GardenOpened in 2015 on the former bowling green at Dyke Road Park, BOAT was the brainchild of the late playwright Adrian Bunting.

Photograph: Michelle DevanePA WireThe contract awarded to US-based Quest Diagnostics laboratory to deal with the backlog of cervical smear tests was given without proper due diligence or risk assessment, a review has revealed.President of DCU Prof Brian MacCraith found that the almost total reliance on a single international supplier of laboratory services for the CervicalCheck national cancer screening programme was a source of “significant fragility” for the programme and there was a gross underestimation of the scale of the problem.And he warned that too few people within CervicalCheck were managing too many projects.His rapid review, commissioned on July 15th and published on Tuesday, was established after it emerged that the HSE was aware that more than 800 women and their GPs had not been informed of their smear test results because of IT failings and human error. And in 3,215 cases results went to GPs but not to the women concerned.HSE chief executive Paul Reid said a process was under way to inform all women affected and this was expected to be completed in the next few weeks. He stressed that these were designated “low risk cases”.“I really regret and apologise it happened to the women. I wish it was different,” he said as he pledged to develop a culture of “putting women first”.Intentions and deliveryThe organisation 221+ which represents women affected by the original CervicalCheck controversy said it was a relief that the clinical risk was deemed low for the women affected by this specific failure. But it said: “It is clear that there was an inability to ‘join the dots’ as far back as January of this year and that there is still a gap between best intentions and effective delivery.”The report found a decision was made not to communicate with women about the IT problems for six months and Prof MacCraith highlighted the frustration of women “not only by delays in receiving their results but more so by the lack of any clarifying or contextual information”.At the launch of the report for the HSE, he asked what it said about the system that women had to seek their own information through parliamentary questions.Expressing concern that there was no proper due diligence done before Quest Diagnostics undertook the additional tests, Prof MacCraith said the laboratory was approved for testing but the problem was with the lack of checking and validating that the Quest IT system could be seamlessly integrated into Irish operating processes.A new tracking system is to be established to allow women follow the progress of their smear tests to their conclusion. The HSE has appointed management consultant Celine Fitzgerald as interim chief executive of CervicalCheck."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3978969.1565127119!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"q a what is the latest cervicalcheck controversy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Health Simon Harris. Photograph: Alan Betson What is the latest problem with CervicalCheck?Essentially, the IT system at the US-based Quest Diagnostics laboratory in Chantilly, Virginia – which is contracted by the Department of Health to process smear tests – was not compatible with the CervicalCheck IT system and so test results were not being passed on to the Irish system.“Manual workarounds” were used, ie people inputting results. This went on for eight months but should only have been for a short time leading to “human error”.How did the problem start?In November 2018, the National Screening Service, which is over CervicalCheck, agreed to Quest Diagnostics processing additional tests after a 30 per cent increase in the number of tests from 280,000 to 330,000, resulting in a significant backlog. This was a combination of routine smear tests and the offer of free repeat smear tests for women concerned about their results after the original CervicalCheck controversy. This related to delays in information going to more than 220 women diagnosed with cancer.When did knowledge of the IT problem arise?In February 2019, Quest Diagnostics indicated it had a problem transferring results and that a manual process may be required. It was agreed that a manual system be put in place. Quest said it was seeking an e-solution but a manual system would have to continue until it was found.Who made the decision not to contact the women about the problem?In April, CervicalCheck sent a briefing note to all GPs about a range of issues but the women who were awaiting test results were not informed that there was a problem.Who is ‘Sharon’ and what is her role?Sharon, identified only by her first name, is a woman who made repeated calls and sent numerous emails about delays in receiving her smear test results. She first emailed the Department of Health on April 3rd and her persistence was key to the emergence of the large-scale problem.Was anyone else expressing concern about delays?GPs were contacting CervicalCheck about delays in results from the Chantilly facility. The service in turn contacted Quest in June.When was the extent of the problem properly identified?Quest Diagnostics confirmed to the National Screening Service on July 16th that “in or about April 2019” a data file with the results of about 800 “rescue samples” was not sent to Quest’s facility in Dublin which prints and issues the results to GPs. This, it said, was due to “human error”.When were Sharon’s concerns linked to a larger problem?On June 25th, the National Screening Service wrote to the Department of Health about Sharon’s test and this is the first link with the IT problem.When did the screening service find out that Quest Diagnostics had not sent results to GPs?The service found out in the second week of July that the results had not been sent, and on July 10th it told the Department of Health that approximately 800 women were not issued with test result letters.When was the Minister for Health informed?Simon Harris was briefed about the issue on July 10th. On July 15th, Paul Reid, the chief executive of the HSE, announced a rapid review of the controversy which would be chaired by Prof Brian MacCraith, president of Dublin City University. Some 30 interviews were then conducted and more than 4,000 documents reviewed.Wasn’t there another problem with the labs?In November 2018, Quest alerted CervicalCheck to a separate problem about the expiration of samples for HPV testing at its laboratory in Teterboro, New Jersey. A total of 11,763 samples were affected by the expiry date but in 6,446 cases no re-test was found to be required. Quest Laboratories in Chantilly was able to “rescue” some samples. After a re-test, 55 of the “rescue samples” proved positive for HPV, the virus which can cause cancer, when the initial test was negative. The GPs of the women concerned were informed in February 2019.A tracking system is to be established to allow women follow the progress of their tests. On behalf of the HSE, Reid apologised to women, pledged to develop a culture of “putting women first”, and said he accepted all recommendations in the rapid review including ensuring CervicalCheck becomes a well structured organisation."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Social Farming Ireland opens up farm life to adults with physical or intellectual disabilityPaschal Donohoe confirms Taoiseach\u0026rsquos and PM\u0026rsquos offices in contact during BBC interviewJohn Boreland shot as he got out of his car in Belfast in 2016Report shows number of workers aged 50 and over has increased 330,000 in 10 yearsMikey Leddy from Co Meath fatally injured in incident on seafront of Puerto del CarmenToo few people in CervicalCheck managing too many projects, rapid review findsTechnical problem uncovered by woman who questioned delay in getting her resultsProtesters call on Minister to intervene as 18 beef processing plants picketedTaoiseach refuses to play Brexit \u0026lsquoblame game\u0026rsquo during F\u0026eacuteile an Phobail debate in BelfastLetter from Flanagan to members informed them he would be open to reappointing themFormer Fianna F\u0026aacuteil minister and Dublin North West TD \u0026lsquorelieved\u0026rsquo at developmentPaul Reid says health body will \u0026lsquodeliver on all commitments in service plan\u0026rsquoResults of more than 4,000 smear test not affected by \u0026lsquomajor communications failure\u0026rsquoProposal likely to run foul of environmental worries, says Independent Cllr Mannix FlynnPolice expand search into dense jungle and hilly terrain with more than 160 personnelISPCA called to rented apartment in central Cork over abandonment of six petsPaschal Donohoe meets chancellor Sajid Javid to discuss UK\u0026rsquos plans for leaving EUCo Kerry native (81) suggested revisiting vote to remove death penalty from Constitution"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3978650.1565109359!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"droughts force thousands to abandon way of life in somaliland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKhadan Mohammed Hamed (19): She knows about climate change and soil erosion from her biology class and realises that combination has eroded a way of life.  Photograph: Gavin DouglasConcern WorldwideThey are the vanguard of a cohort likely to soon number many millions of people in climate-vulnerable locations across the planet.They are crammed into supposedly temporary camps to cater for the tens of thousands of villagers forced off the land because of sustained droughts.Conditions in settlements on the outskirts of Hargeisa, the capital of Somaliland, and near the city of Borama are primitive – so many people living in close proximity without running water or toilets and with little electricity.Home is in the form of a flimsy makeshift tent, a corrugated iron shack or a tiny house of one room, two at best. Solid waste and vast amounts of plastic are intermittently heaped on the side of narrow streets. There is next-to-no public lighting. What there is comes courtesy of small solar panels, giving a hint of what could be in terms of comfort and safety if the cheap renewable energy source was more fully deployed.Water supplyWater is trucked in, the same way 70 per cent of Hargeisa is supplied, though there are plans to build a water supply system with international support. For now, water has to be boiled, invariably by way of a wood fire, before consumption.Listening to their stories of forced migration, many are clearly traumatised at having to abandon a rural way of life, which up to a few years ago was feasible in spite of intermittent drought. Many pine to return to the land but they know it is not feasible.They are officially described as “internally displaced people” (IDPs), forced to flee their home but who remain within the country’s borders. In reality, most are climate refugees.In Somaliland, a self-declared state in east Africa twice the size of Ireland, they are estimated to total 600,000 people, though that number can rise sharply in response to drought, flooding or a cyclone, events occurring more frequently due to climate disruption.Through interpreters, the common thread emerges: loss of livestock due to more frequent droughts and not enough water to sustain their pastoral existence. In contrast, increased floods are often a contributory factor, as they wash away crops, turn fields into gulleys and undermine attempts to ersify. It ends with the inevitable move to the city and for some a camp, where they have lived for almost 10 years.With dignity, women outline their personal circumstances in an unvarnished way. In more ways than one they are household heads and look after money efficiently. Sometimes it’s a consequence of husbands and sons still working in rural areas.Listening to their stories and observing their surroundings is enough to graphically illustrate arduous circumstances. It is a harrowing experience because their distress is palpable and yet solutions seem obvious and inexpensive to an outsider.The three camps near Hargeisa – Dgalli (9,000 people in 1,500 households), Mooga A (3,000 people, 500 households) and Mooga B (1,300 people, 225 households) – are barely a few kilometres apart.Sahra Badal, who has been five years and seven months in Dgalli, still describes herself as a pastoralist. A orcee with five children, she had 35 goats and a donkey to sustain the family. Now it’s just three goats that wander around stony land with little vegetation where the camp is located – most goats in the vicinity have a tag around their neck with the mobile phone number of their owner.Selling fruit“Life is very difficult but cash helps,” she says, referring gratefully to monthly support of $60, which enables her to send her children to school and helped her set up a small business selling fruit and vegetables.Her neighbour Nura Ismail Saed, who is two years in the camp, would prefer to move back to the rural area from which she came with her five children but she suggests this is unlikely. Asked if that made her sad, she replies: “A lot, a lot.”In Mooga B, which has the least facilities – no shops, no school, no available land nearby, the women repeatedly highlight the absence of toilets one describes how a pregnant woman had to be brought to a mobile health clinic in a wheelbarrow.Indications of emerging resilience are the only heartening aspect in the face of such poverty. Milgo Ahmed Hashi sells milk from her home, which she buys in from Hargeisa. With no refrigeration, she uses plastic bags in an attempt to keep it cool and plans to have it all sold by 5pm daily so it doesn’t sour. The profits enable her to feed and clothe her 10 children. She hopes there will soon be enough to send her children to school.Khadan Mohammed Hamed (19) completed her secondary education, and though she failed her exams as she was affected by her mother’s death at the time, she hopes to resit them. “I hope to continue, to become a doctor,” she adds. She knows about climate change and soil erosion from her biology class. She realises that combination has eroded a way of life for “people, who were successful farmers, and not farmers any more”.That resilience is obvious the next day when visiting a more established settlement, Ayah 4. A large sign indicates 350 concrete housing units were constructed by UN-Habitat with support “from the people of Japan”. There is an air of permanency though some still live in traditional tents. Many are reconnecting with land nearby (provided by the government) and have more significant livestock numbers. Local commerce is evident with tiny shops, a local market and a small cafe selling tea.Self-help groupsIt is clear that self-help groups, including some aimed at teenagers, set up with support from Concern Worldwide and other aid organisations, are helping to form a backbone for the community.Emerging entrepreneurship is real. Some have savings, which suggests better prospects and quality of life may be realisable. But it means also hard questions have to be faced up to among large sections of what were once nomadic people, according to the director of the Somali Cash Consortium, Alessandro Bini. Is urbanisation, including a shift to small business and services industry, the best option for most of these people? Does it mean pastoralism must change to agriculture which is inevitably more intensive, entailing, for example, pesticides?Implemented correctly, he believes more sustainable communities are possible – backed by “a long-term, predictable safety net” covering the basic needs of a good proportion of the population on a constant basis.Drought year after year makes rural communities weak and vulnerable, according to Abdi-Rashid Haji, Concern Worldwide’s Somalia country director, who recalls how a woman illustrated her plight to him by placing a stick in a piece of muddy, unstable ground, adding: “This was my farm.”“That is when you lose confidence and you end up in an IDP camp,” he says.In building resilience development organisations are acutely conscious that repeated drought prompts negative coping strategies, such as child marriage and labour, school dropouts and family separation.Displacement also gives rise to concerns about safety and security, and underlines the need for child protection. Sexual and gender-based violence in camps is an additional risk. In that scenario, female-headed households, children, older people, those with disabilities and marginalised communities are especially vulnerable to abuse, as well as disease and malnutrition.Reports indicate some urban IDPs in Hargeisa and Burao cities are experiencing “extreme food security outcomes” and the official classification “catastrophe” is figuring more frequently. A visit to a Save the Children health clinic on the outskirts of Borama confirms how close communities, even those in IDP camps, are to famine.Lack of sanitationOut of 1,633 children under five assessed between September and December last year, 319 were “moderately malnourished” and 150 “severely malnourished”.Similar levels have been recorded this year, before the worst effects of the latest drought are predicted to kick in. Poor hygiene arising from a lack of sanitation gives rise to widespread diarrhoea, especially among the young, which further exacerbates their vulnerability.The increasing lure of the city is summed up by Roda Osman living in the rural village of Jir Jir. She has 13 children, three of whom are staying with relatives in the city of Borama and attend secondary school there. She hopes they will get a scholarship to go to university or get a job. “Without education, life is without light,” she adds.Droughts and Cyclone Sagar reduced their livestock to 10 goats and two camels. Crops in recent years have only yielded fodder. She is surviving because of cash payments via mobile from Concern. Fearing further livestock losses, she is quietly banking on her children already in the city, and a hope that with a job they will be able to build a house “and take us to the city”.* Kevin O’Sullivan travelled to Somaliland with the support of Concern Worldwide"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3978818.1565110894!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"self help groups transforming communities ravaged by drought","story":"An initiative known as Durable Solutions, funded by the EU, is helping families displaced in Somaliland to run small businesses through startup grants.

Since starting the Concern programme, they’ve grown  in wealth, confidence and wellbeing. Photograph: Gavin DouglasConcern Worldwide Almost 20 women are sitting on rugs under the canopy of a large tree with a steel box in their midst with three separate locks.They live in a rural area south of Borama and formed a self-help group called Janagal, which means “paradise” in Somali. It was set up after the 2017 drought with training and seed capital of $376 provided by Concern Worldwide. They sell women’s clothes and shoes which they buy in from the town of Togwajale. “Business is good. We make a good profit,” explains their nominated spokeswoman. In fact, it’s so good they plan to ersify into livestock products and to sell them to farmers in their area, which is made up of 350 households scattered over a wide area.Each member has to deposit the equivalent of $82 monthly into their minibank. Profits are used to reinvest in the business, to help families in difficulty and people who are ill and need healthcare.The women ask if we would like to look at their current assets. The box is opened by three separate keyholders and a large wad of Somali shillings is put on display. “We have $988,” the spokeswoman declares proudly as a smaller amount of dollar bills are laid out.Run a businessOne of the women suggests they might train us on how to run a business they all laugh. On a more serious note, their success has spawned other small businesses formed by neighbours acting on their own initiative without input from outside agencies but using the same approach.Janagal’s success is clear: “The money made a difference. We did not migrate,” the spokeswoman said.Generally, there are 20 women per group who over a year go through two training modules. “The objective is to build strong groups who establish an internal saving and loan scheme which the women decide and manage themselves,” explains Rory Crew of Concern, who is also finance and systems director with Somali Cash Consortium, which helps provide direct support via mobile phones.When the groups are “mature”, Concern opens a formal bank account for the group and provides a start-up grant so the group can establish one or several joint businesses. Group members come from the same community, have a similar social status and share the same problems. Trust and good relationships between group members are very important. “We provide a set of inputs . . . cash books where savings and loans are recorded, a cash box, calculators, etc. We visit the group regularly and check their books are kept up to date and savings and loans, or repayments, are recorded properly to help the groups avoid conflict.”The second training module and a vision-building exercise focus on business skills, such as simple cost calculation and developing a business plan.Buying goats“Mostly, the women engage in simple activities, such as animal fattening (buying goats at low prices during lean season and fattening them up to sell them at high prices before national holidays), petty trade, some vegetable production.” Participants are very positive about the financial gain from the programme but also the social dimension – the opportunity to meet other women with similar needs. It has boosted their self-confidence and standing in the community.Once well established, other programmes can be introduced on human rights advocacy, education, child protection and female genital mutilation, Crew adds.In parallel there is an integrated programme incorporating agriculture, food, income, markets and education. Focused on supporting sustainable livelihoods, it targets school-aged young people, vulnerable women, farmers and pastoralists. Separate efforts are made to build resilience at community level.Some 89 per cent of members reported their resilience to shocks and stresses had increased. They can access emergency assistance and collective support more easily. They benefit from social networks and improved livelihoods.Urban self-help groups do better with business development and success, but this may simply be due to the easier link with markets and potential customers. That is confirmed by the range of businesses in Ayah 4 settlement outside Hargeisa.Long-term solutionsYurub Hussein Mohmoud has lived there for four years following the loss of all her livestock from drought. She prefers life there where she has her own shop selling food, toiletries, cigarettes and camel’s milk. She is a participant in an EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa project aimed at creating long-term solutions for displaced populations.Ista Hil Yusef heads up a Concern-supported group known as Alikhwua (“sisters”), with each member having their own business.

They said on Monday they would block administrators from entering the site.“There has been a series of board meetings, the result of which is that administrators will be appointed over the course of the day,” a Harland and Wolff spokesman said.The business was put up for sale last year by Norwegian parent Dolphin Drilling, which filed for bankruptcy in June. The Norwegian administrator of Dolphin Drilling did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday.Opened in 1861, Harland and Wolff employed more than 30,000 people in its Second World War heyday and remains a potent symbol of Belfast’s past as an industrial engine of the British Empire.Created with Sketch.Curse of the Titanic: What happened to those who survived?

That followed similarly muted growth in May and June.\u0026nbspJuly’s increase was propped up by spending on entertainment such as cinema tickets for Toy Story 4 and The Lion King.“Spending has remained relatively subdued over the past few months, with an underlying uncertainty about the wider economic and political landscape causing many to hold off making purchases of bigger ticket items,” said Esme Harwood, director at Barclaycard.Consumer spending, which makes up over 60 percent of Britain’s GDP, has so far been relatively immune to the Brexit turmoil that has hurt businesses’ revenues and investment.

It was a message to a publisher asking him to send a copy of Bloom’s latest book,\u0026nbspPossessed by Memory, a memoir mediated through literature, “to the magnificent British actress, Dame Janet Suzman”.I’m visiting Harold Bloom, America’s venerable and semi-omniscient literary critic, at his beautiful old wooden house on a leafy street in New Haven, where – having just celebrated his 89th birthday – he is still teaching. Via Skype. He’s a bit too frail to be allowed on the Yale campus (they say the insurance won’t cover him).\u0026nbsp“What was your high point then, looking back over your life?”“Ah, Dame Janet,” he sighs.After 40-odd years, he is still in love with Janet Suzman. His wife, Jeanne, is sitting right there by the way. She doesn’t mind. I should stress one thing (in fairness to all concerned): Bloom and Suzman have never met. Unless you count across a very crowded auditorium. She was playing Cleopatra at the National Theatre some time in the late 1970s. Harold Bloom was in the audience (as, by a strange coincidence, was I). For Harold, it was the coup de foudre. He was too shaken by the whole experience to ever articulate his passion, until a year or two back when I finally put the two of them in touch, over email.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

She will remain forever exactly as she was on stage, dressed as an Egyptian queen, her words precisely scripted by William Shakespeare. It is the purest love you can imagine, a literary love affair, based on highly metaphorical language. Cleopatra was in love with Anthony, but for at least that one evening Bloom was Anthony,\u0026nbspeven though he generally thinks of himself as more of a Falstaff, a hedonistic lover of life and adventurer.Harold is not in great shape. He can’t go very far, physically speaking, except for regular trips to the hospital and a rehab clinic. He is wheelchair-bound. His wife says it’s all down to a weak heart and arthritis. He has a nurse attending him while I’m there. He calls out for ice to be put on his back. His hand is trembling as he signs a copy of his book. The last time he wrote to me, he said, with an apocalyptic air, “my future is indeterminate”. Which applies to us all, but especially to Harold.\u0026nbspSuzman in regal headdress as Cleopatra back in 1974 (ITVRex)His word for himself is “decrepit”. His mind is as sharp as ever it was, but inside a body that is in terminal decline. He is suffering from the opposite of dementia: decorporia, or physical disintegration. Mens sana in a corpore that is anything but sano. “There is a tremor in my fingers,” he writes, “my legs tend to give out, my teeth diminish, incipient macular degeneration dims my eyes, deafness increases, birdsong is scarcely heard, every height augments my apprehension of falling.” When he thinks about death, he quotes Dr Johnson: “This secret horrour of the last is inseparable from a thinking being whose life is limited, and to whom death is dreadful.”The Shakespeare cult shoves aside better writers in UK schoolsAll is True review: A fanciful but nuanced portrait of ShakespeareThere is a strange bond between us. My father’s name is also Harold. Middle name “Horatio”, which Bloom in his Shakespearean way is particularly fond of. “I’m old enough to be your father,” he says. I’m a bit of a prodigal symbolic son though. I struggle to remember the books my own father was particularly keen on. “He was more into motorbikes than books, to be honest,” I say.I can do the things that Harold can no longer do: hiking up the mountains of Montana or surfing.\u0026nbsp“Don’t you ever get tired?” he says. In fact he hates going to the beach anyway: “I turn into a lobster when exposed to the sun.” He is content to keep on reading and keep on remembering.There is an implicit and explicit shoutout in his work to Proust’s In Search of Lost Time, merging memory and art with an evanescent impression of immortality. His earliest memory is of playing on the floor of his mother’s kitchen while she prepared the Sabbath meal. As she goes by he reaches out and touches her toes she reaches down and rumples his hair and says, “My sweet Harry”.Now, approaching the end of his story, he likes to quote the Book of Ecclesiastes, chapter 12: “Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail: because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about the street.” A line in Ecclesiastes which I’ve never heard him quote is this one: “Much study is a weariness of the flesh.” He adheres to the later Jewish tradition (perhaps imported via neoplatonism) of study being the path to salvation.He was born in 1930 in the Bronx, the son of immigrants, and grew up speaking Yiddish. “My father could speak Russian but refused to my mother spoke Polish, but refused to, for political reasons.” He only learned English around the age of six\u0026nbspwhen his older sisters brought it home from school. So he came at it from the outside, rather like Joseph Conrad or Vladimir Nabokov, and was (and remains) bewitched by the language.Suzman\u0026nbspon the Andrew Marr show in March\u0026nbspthis year\u0026nbspshow (Rex)His first reading was of the poets William Blake and Hart Crane, and he came to Shakespeare very early on, around the age of eight\u0026nbspor nine\u0026nbsphe thinks. “When I was very young, I read poems incessantly because I was lonely and somehow must have believed they could become people for me.” Legend has it that he could read a thousand pages an hour (he says it was only 400 at best).When I was very young, I read poems incessantly because I was lonely and somehow must have believed they could become people for meHe retains his youthful magical thinking about literature. Bloom has now written 40-something books about books – poetry, novels, plays, sacred texts. And his “memoir” is largely a homage to some of his favourite writers. As Oscar Wilde once said:\u0026nbsp“Criticism is the only civilised form of autobiography.” Bloom harks back to the Bible often enough, but he is (as he describes Marcel Proust) more of “an atheistic mystic”. He quotes Ralph Waldo Emerson with approval: “As men’s prayers are a disease of their will, so are their creeds a disease of the intellect.Literature is the closest thing Harold has to a religion. Writers such as\u0026nbspShakespeare and Milton and Wordsworth are like a substitute for the elusive Yahweh of the book of Genesis. Which explains why he retains an essentially sacred view of writing and is concerned to defend the “western canon” (from Homer through to James Joyce) against unbelievers and sceptics (which probably includes me).His attitude could be summed up in the opening lines of John’s Gospel: “In the beginning was the Word (logos), and the Word was with God (theon), and the Word was God.” But he was brought up on the Torah, the Jewish Bible, and was later seduced by the medieval tradition of Kabbalah, which says that the world was called into being via 10\u0026nbsputterances (or “Sefirot”) and that therefore the whole of life is language. Organised religion, monotheism-style, derived from a reverence for the written text.Bloom derives consolation from the books that surround him on shelves and in piles on the table and on the floor. In Possessed by Memory, he writes that “Frequently at dawn, when I am very chilly and sit on the side of my bed, knowing it is not safe for me to go downstairs by myself in order to have some morning tea, I find deep peace in (Wallace) Stevens at his strongest.” If he was a Pharaoh, he would presumably ask to be buried with his books at his side.He met his wife Jeanne in New Haven in 1955. They were both students at Yale. She was doing a degree in history, he had just returned from a year on a Fulbright scholarship at Pembroke College, Cambridge (England). They married in 1958. Now, more than 60 years later, she says:\u0026nbsp“You can’t stop him. Nothing would stop him from continuing to teach and write – it’s what he does.”How my article about young adult literature caused a ‘tweetstorm’Brexit isn’t a new idea, just ask DickensNobel Prize in Literature to be awarded twice this yearHe tends to remember people according to the books or poems they make him think of. So for example, there was a student called Fergy he met at Cornell. She was from Kentucky. “She had freckles and red hair, and I always told her that she looked like a female Huck Finn. Tall, slim, incredibly graceful, she had a way of running around me as we walked, since she was swift and I was slow.” Everything is mediated through literature. “Almost every night I dream about departed friends, sometimes mixing them up with fictive characters.”At this stage of the game – the dreaded “twilight” zone – Bloom has lost most of his old friends. His books are a way of calling them back again. The notion of a resurrection is still important to him – but one that precedes death. It is not surprising, when his own body is failing, if he finds consolation in images of transcendence, in which the soul is at last disembodied:Hence in a season of calm weatherHe quotes from Proust’s account of the death of (his imaginary writer) Bergotte: “They buried him, but all through that night of mourning, in the lighted shop-windows, his books, arranged three by three, kept vigil like angels with outspread wings and seemed, for him who was no more, the symbol of his resurrection”.There are perhaps three key concepts that recur again and again in Bloom: freedom, God, and immortality. All three of them appear as delusions, but ones that can be elusively attained or at least entertained in works of literature. Bloom would probably concur with Borges that literature is defined by “the sense of the imminence of a revelation that does not occur”.None of which stops Bloom from forever searching, not just for his own earliest memories but what might be something like the earliest memories of humanity, for what he calls, “a primal sound, cast out of our cosmos and wandering in exile through the interstellar spaces”. One of the stories he is most drawn to in the Old Testament – the Book of Genesis – is that of Jacob, who finds himself wrestling with a passing god all through the night. Bloom sees that – a close encounter with the ine – as an allegory of his own life.“In the half-light of my incessant nocturnal wakefulness, I begin to conceive of it as the struggle of every solitary deep reader to find in the highest literature what will suffice.”\u0026nbspFrequently at dawn, when I am very chilly and sit on the side of my bed, knowing it is not safe for me to go downstairs by myself in order to have some morning tea, I find deep peace in (Wallace) Stevens at his strongestThe “most important thing in the book” he says is his theory of “self-other seeing”, notably in Shakespeare, where characters like Hamlet and Macbeth are capable of seeing themselves from the outside, as if they were someone else – an idea to some extent inspired or inflected by the experience he has had when (more than once) falling and breaking some fragile part of his body: “I recall the repetition of an acute phantasmagoria that this was not happening to me but to some other person.”One of his favourite words is agon, nothing to do with “agony” as such, but definitely concerned with struggle, as if in an arena (like Ben Hurr). He is certainly always struggling with something or someone, whether god or man, or just entropy in general.Finnegans Wake springs to mind.) Books are old school and contrive to hold new school technology at bay. “The final book here, The Book of Numbers, by the still-youthful Joshua Cohen, is a courageous assault on our Age of the Screen, the great grey ocean of the internet.”I quote that from Bright Book of Life: Fifty-Two Novels to Reread ‘Ere I Vanish. While I was hanging out chez Bloom, as well as emailing Dame Janet, I also had to email myself the manuscripts of two other books that Harold has already written but not yet published.Bright Book, the other is Take Arms Against a Sea of Troubles, a study of poetry, or “the power of the reader’s mind over a universe of death”. As his wife says, there is no stopping him. Each book is a way of deferring death, a bulwark against the erosion of time, a “symbol of his resurrection”.In all writers and all times, in philosophers and poets, Bloom finds consolation – companionship – in the face of the void. But if you had to name one, it would have to be Shakespeare, and precariously poised as he is between being and non-being, it would have to be in the figure of Hamlet: “We defy augury. There’s a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be, ‘tis not to come if it be not to come, it will be now it if be not now, yet it will come. The readiness is all. Since no man, of aught he leaves, knows aught, what is’t to leave betimes? Let be.”Andy Martin is the author of With Child: Lee Child and the Readers of Jack Reacher (Polity) and teaches at the University of CambridgeOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

When it arrived in April, however, it crashed, and the mission was aborted.For most people and the majority of the mission, that catastrophic event brought everything to a close. But the tardigrades – true to their reputation for being hardy – might have survived the crashed and been spread across the surface, where they could be living on today.Created with Sketch.Best NASA pictures of the month - July 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A total solar eclipse as seen from the US National Science Federation observatory in the Chilean Andes on 2 JulyA composite image of the Cygnus OB2 star cluster composed of pictures taken by the Isaac Newton Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope on July 24The spacecraft Soyuz MS-13 is launched at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on July 20A copy of LIFE magazine from July 4 1969 signed by Michael Collins is seen onboard the Soyuz spacecraftThe galaxy NGC 1156 which is said to resemble a cherry blossom tree.

He and his organisation loaded the Beresheet lander up with a library that could serve as a summary of life on Earth: 30 million pages of information, samples of human DNA, and the tardigrades.Tardigrades were first discovered in the 18th century, and have fascinated scientists ever since. They are tiny, measuring just half a milimetre long, and are found all around Earth.Much of the reason for the fascination is just how able they are to withstand extreme environments and survive. They have shown the ability to be exposed to very high and low temperatures, intense pressure, as well as being deprived of air, food and water, as well as already demonstrating that they can live after being put in outer space.They do that party by going into a very strange hibernation, where they can switch off a variety of biological processes and then restart them again when they wake back up. They could be doing that on the Moon, scientists warn, ready to be revived when conditions are right.As such, scientists don\u0027t think that the tardigrades will be thriving on the Moon. But they could be waiting there ready to be picked up and revived, they say, and could stay in that state for years.On other planets that could potentially be home to life, Nasa and other space agencies are very careful about contaminating the surface with life from the Earth. But the Moon is considered dead and so restrictions are much less – with Apollo astronauts leaving bacteria there in the fecal matter they dropped on the surface.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Its creator,\u0026nbspMathew Roberts, was told it happened for violating community standards but is still mystified about why exactly it happened.What is ‘storm Area 51’ and are alien-hunters about to raid the base?I never got any reason behind the event being removed, Mr Roberts told CNET. I created a sister event which amassed about 15,000 people before being taken down for no reason.Mr Roberts said the removal had caused a problem because he had actually intended to host a festival on 20 September, the day the page had joked the raid would take place. That event would allow people to commemorate the event without being dangerously close to the dangerous base.I think it\u0027s pretty reckless of Facebook, especially because I\u0027m trying to direct people away from storming the base, Mr Roberts said.

Tesco  outlets were originally designed for a weekly shop but\u0026nbspseven in 10 customers now use them as convenience stores, purchasing food to eat that day, the company said.To adapt to this change Tesco said it would implement faster and simpler ways of filling shelves, keeping less stock in store rooms and more on shelves. Staff members will be asked to work more “flexibly” around the store.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

We must be ‘greener’ rather than ‘greyer’.”​Speaking ahead of publication, Mr Khan said: “Access to nature should be available to all Londoners regardless of wealth or background.David\u0026nbspLindo’s\u0026nbspvision of bringing nature closer to people is exactly the kind of idea that London needs to ensure we remain one of the greenest cities in the world and face up to the challenge of tackling a climate emergency.”The recommendations are among a series of proposals aiming to stimulate debate ahead of next year’s London mayoral elections.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We would let the Scottish people decide. That’s democracy... there\u0026nbspare other views within the party but that’s our view.”Labour’s manifesto at the 2017 general election claimed independence in Scotland would “lead to turbocharged austerity for Scottish families”.The document added: “Labour opposes a second Scottish independence referendum. It is unwanted an unnecessary, and we we will campaign tirelessly to ensure Scotland remains part of the UK.”Speaking earlier this year on the issue of a second referendum for Scotland, Mr Leonard said a Labour government would “not agree to to a second independence referendum”.Majority of Scots back independence in shock poll after Johnson visitMr Leonard added if Labour won a general election the party would refuse to grant a “Section 30 order” giving Holyrood the power to hold a second vote on independence.“What we said in the manifesto at the 2017 election was that there is no case for, and we would not support, a second independence referendum.”Following Mr McDonnell’s remarks, a Scottish Labour spokesperson insisted the shadow chancellor was “clearly not advocating a second independence referendum”.\u0026nbsp“He made clear the huge benefit a UK Labour government\u0026nbspwill bring for the people of Scotland”.On Brexit, Mr McDonnell said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would “never” step down if other opposition parties demanded it to form a coalition of national unity.Government accused of playing ‘blame game’ over no-deal BrexitUK’s hopes of good post-Brexit trade deal with US branded ‘delusional’EU prepares for no-deal as PM has ‘no intention’ of renegotiatingNigel Farage cleared by Ofcom for saying Jon Snow ‘should be attacked’The shadow chancellor said:”It won’t happen. I think we’d form a minority government, seek to implement our manifesto and we’d expect the other opposition parties and other MPs to vote for those policies and if they don’t we’ll go back to the country.“If they want to vote against a real living wage, if they want to vote against £70bn\u0026nbspworth of investment in Scottish infrastructure, if they want to vote against a green industrial revolution to tackle climate change then so be it, we’ll go back to the people and then let them explain to the people why they wouldn’t support those policies.”“We want to change the world, we’re not going be held back by other parties.”Mr McDonnell’s remarks echoed comments from the party’s senior frontbencher Rebecca Long-Bailey, who earlier told Channel 4 News that Labour “wouldn’t countenance” a government of national unity.“We think that we need to have a clear majority for a government in parliament, and that’s why we’re calling for a general election,” she said.\u0026nbsp“What we don’t want is a national unity government that gives Boris some sort of get out of jail free card.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is the slowest rise since the BRC started collecting records in 1995.\u0026nbspIn July alone, sales ticked up 0.3 per cent from a year ago after falls in the previous two months.\u0026nbsp“The UK may have had record temperatures in July, but retail sales were far from record-breaking at just 0.3 per cent growth,” said Paul Martin, UK head of retail at KPMG, which sponsors the survey.\u0026nbspHe noted that online non-food sales, which have held up particularly well this year, increased by only 3.7 per cent last month – a “considerably” slower rise than in previous years.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Australia\u0027s Nathan Lyon celebrates after taking the wicket of England\u0027s Joe Root during day five of the first Ashes test at Edgbaston.

That followed similarly muted growth in May and June.\u0026nbspJuly’s increase was propped up by spending on entertainment such as cinema tickets for Toy Story 4 and The Lion King.“Spending has remained relatively subdued over the past few months, with an underlying uncertainty about the wider economic and political landscape causing many to hold off making purchases of bigger ticket items,” said Esme Harwood, director at Barclaycard.Consumer spending, which makes up over 60 percent of Britain’s GDP, has so far been relatively immune to the Brexit turmoil that has hurt businesses’ revenues and investment. But there are emerging signs consumers are also starting to slow down as the Brexit deadline nears.\u0026nbspFor example, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said on Monday that sales of new cars to iniduals fell 2 per cent in July compared with a year ago.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They have three sons together.He was married to his first we, academic Jane Chapman, from  to .According to Spears, the Labour leader’s net worth is a staggering £million.Corbyn is suggesting that Labour WILL back a second referendum in his latest Brexit flip-flop.The leftie leader said there should be a public vote on any deal agreed by Parliament.His U-turn comes after Labour slipped to third place in the polls with Remainers abandoning the party in favour of pro-EU rivals.The party has previously said it would support a second referendum in order to stop No Deal or a bad Tory deal.But now Mr Corbyn has suggested hell back a so-called peoples vote on any deal at all.The Labour leader told the BBCs Andrew Marr Show: I want us to get a good deal and then have a decision of the public after that.If we can get that through Parliament, the proposals weve put, then I think it would be reasonable to have a public vote to decide on that in the future.The next general election is not due until  - although in todays topsy-turvy politics, no one would rule out an earlier ballot.Theresa May resigned on May  and now Boris Johnson has the top job after winning the Tory leadership contest.It is uncleara General Election will be called before the next one.The Labour party would have to win a large number of seats for him to become PM.The odds of him being the next person in number  are  , according to William Hill.Corbyn spent most of his -year career as an MP as an obscure backbencher.But in a remarkable turn of events the bearded throwback leftie was propelled from the political fringe to leading the UKs main opposition party.Ed Miliband, who lost the General Election against the odds in , decided to open up future leadership contests to the public for a £ fee.But instead of drawing in a wide spectrum of society, the opportunity to vote was seized by a hard left faction which later became known as Momentum.And so with their support the crumpled maverick won the votes.Corbyn’s low-fi style in contrast to other polished politicians also won him support from young people looking for a no-frills socialist leader.His leadership was then challenged in  after his lacklustre support for the Remain camp in the Brexit vote.After a no-confidence vote was supported by  Labour MPs to  against, a leadership battle began between Corbyn and Welsh MP Owen Smith.But after Momentum marshalled support for him, Corbyn actually increased his leadership from . per cent to . per cent.However, after just four years doing the job it was rumoured he was tired and fed up.Allies have reportedly claimed hell soon hand over to another MP.One Shadow Cabinet member told the Evening Standard: Corbyn is ready to step down.

but an insolvency request could not spell the end for the firm.At its height, Harland and Wolff employed more than , people and was booming during Belfasts golden age of shipbuilding.The innovative shipbuilders were among the first to replace wooden upper decks with iron - revolutionising shipbuilding and making the vessels much stronger.They also made the ships flatter and squarer at the bottom - increasing the capacity.Edward James Harland and Hamberg-born Gustav Wolff founded the firm, which is best known for building the RMS Titanic,  years ago.In the early th century, it was the most prolic builder of ocean liners.During the Second World War, the company helped build up Northern Irelands shipping assets, producing  warships,  merchant ships and over  tanks.With works beginning in , the iconic ship was built at Harland and Wolffs shipyard in Belfast.It was the largest ship afloat at the time and had an estimated , passengers and crew on board.Tragically, the liner is known for hitting an iceberg just four days into its voyage to New York City.The Titanic was wrecked and sank in the Atlantic Ocean within just three hours of hitting the iceberg.It is thought that more than , people died during the shipwreck.These images capture the busting brilliance of the shipyard in its prime, when it dominated the world stage of shipbuilding.However, this week it has been revealed that the business will cease trading, putting  jobs at risk.An accountancy firm DBO has been appointed administrators to Harland and Wolff, which could end the iconic  year legacy of the company.Unions representing workers have called for the shipyard to be nationalised, arguing that it would be cheaper for the government to keep the shipyard open and running.However, officials have advised against government intervention leading to fears that the shipping company may be coming to its end."},{"url":null,"title":"queen reunited shetland pony","story":"The -year-old -

sparking fears of a new Cold War.This comes after the US withdrawal last week from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treatywhich it signed with the Soviet Union in .China’s director of the foreign ministrys Arms Control Department, Fu Cong said the move would have a direct negative impact on the global strategic stability as well as security in Europe and the Asia-Pacic region.Fu said China was particularly concerned about announced plans to develop and test a land-based intermediate-range missile in the Asia-Pacic sooner rather than later, in the words of one US official.China will not stand idly by and be forced to take countermeasures should the US deploy intermediate-range ground-based missiles this part of the world, Fu told reporters at a specially called briefing.He also advised other nations, particularly South Korea, Japan and Australia, to exercise prudence and not allow the US to deploy such weapons on their territory, saying that would not serve the national security interests of these countries.US Defence Secretary Mark Esper said in Asia over the weekend that he wanted to deploy mid-range conventional missiles in the Asia-Pacic within months.Australian officials said Monday that the locations for the bases were not yet known but their country would not be one of them.Fu also said China had no intention of joining nuclear weapons reduction talks with the US and Russia, pointing to the huge gap in the size of Chinas arsenal compared to those of the other two.China has an estimated  nuclear warheads deployed, compared to , for Russia and , for the US, according to the Federation of American Scientists.Russian President Vladimir Putin has called for urgent arms control talks to prevent a chaotic arms race following the treatys demise.He also said Monday that Russia would only deploy new intermediate-range missilesthe US does.China has already shown maximum restraint in developing its arsenal and stuck to its policy that it would not be the first to use a nuclear weapon in a conflict, Fu said.I dont think it is reasonable or even fair to expect China to participate in an arms reduction negotiation at this stage, Fu said.He added that China remained committed to multilateral efforts to reduce nuclear stockpiles, such as the UNs Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, although it has yet to raty that agreement.Fu wouldnt elaborate on what countermeasures China was considering taking against the US, saying only that everything is on the table.”However he did say China has never and would never take part in a nuclear arms race.Nor would he say how China might retaliate against countries that hosted US land-based intermediate-range missiles.China has previously used economic means to retaliate against South Korea over its deployment of an American anti-missile defence system.Fu dismissed US arguments for leaving the treaty as pure pretext, saying Washington was merely looking for an excuse to develop new weapons.If Washington truly believes Russia is cheating on the treaty, as it says, than the way forward is to negotiate rather than withdraw, he said.Meanwhile, Washingtons argument that it is threatened by China because  percent or more of Chinese missiles fall into the intermediate-range category doesnt hold up, Fu says.He explains that those missiles would be unable to reach the continental United States.So the US would be the least to worrythat is the case, Fu said. That shows that all of this is nothing but a pretext.Defence analysts say Chinas large arsenal of land-based intermediate-range missiles are intended primarily to degrade Taiwans defences, target Guam and other key US bases in the region.Those are typied by the advanced DF- intermediate-range ballistic missile, capable of lofting both conventional and nuclear warheads, the latter to carry out a rapid retaliatory strike, and the DF-D, which is built to take out an aircraft carrier.And while China argues its nukes are small in number and purely for defensive purposes, major technological upgrades made by Beijing offer fresh arguments for why it should be included in future treaties, said Collin Koh, a regional security expert at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.The INF Treaty signed by Russia and the US in  expired Friday, with Washington saying it withdrew because of Moscow’s alleged violations of the pact.Russia denies breaching the terms.Some observers say the real reason was a perceived need to counter Chinas advances in missile technology and restore a balance in light of lingering questions over the effectiveness of anti-missile defence systems.The end of the INF Treaty comes amid rising doubts about whether the two countries will extend an agreement on long-range nuclear weapons scheduled to expire in  known as New START.Trump said he has been discussing a new agreement to reduce nuclear weapons with China and Russia.And I will tell you China was very, very excited about talking about it and so was Russia, Trump told reporters. So I think well have a deal at some point.Asked about Trumps comments, Fu said he didnt wish to contradict Trump, but repeated that China has no interest and, frankly, we dont think we are even in a position to participate in a trilateral negotiation aimed at a nuclear arms reduction."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle baby shower sneaked attention","story":"Documents from the US State Department show how the Duchess of Sussex wanted to change the “optics” of her departure from five-star The Mark Hotel in New York.According to the report: “The VIP [Meghan] explained that her intent was to change the literal optics of the departure, making it appear that she was at least attempting to sneak out of the hotel in photos rather than exiting through the main entrance and giving the potential impression that she was enjoying the media attention.”But her demand to leave the hotel out of a service entrance meant vehicles had to be moved to line up at that door - telegraphing the change - says the report.However, the -year-old duchess was more concerned with the “literal optics” of her departure.Former actress Meghan was criticised for her lavish baby shower – which saw her rubbing shoulders with a host of celebrities, including Amal Clooney and Serena Williams.American TV anchor Gayle King and Meg’s best friend Jessica Mulroney also attended her whistle-stop tour of the Big Apple, which brought streets to a standstill.Fans and press lined up at barriers on Manhattans Upper East side the star-studded celebration in February - the full cost of which was not revealed by the state department.Delivery men were seen bringing large flower arrangements and decorations into The Mark - where she was staying in the £,-a-night penthouse suite.During the shower, Meghan left through an entrance around the side of the hotel to get in a State Department car and drive to the swanky ‘Polo Bar’ for dinner with pals.Trying to evade the cameras, she then tried to change the route to the restaurant that was just . miles away, but details of her trip were leaked.She was snapped going in and leaving the restaurant.The State Department files obtained by DailyMail also show Meghan changed restaurants at the last minute at lunch to a location where she couldnt be photographed.She had wanted to eat at Flora Bar, the Met museums lavish restaurant that has a large glass ceiling where the public -

He also adds that: “I prefer a quiet le away from the day job.” And the band played Believe It If You Like.To recap: Paul is a master baker who caught a lucky break after being booked to appear on what became TV juggernaut The Great British Bake Off.Back then he was happily married to we Alex and, outside of an occasional media interview to plug the show, his home le never made the headlines.A bit of work and no play made Paul a dull boy when it came to clickbait. Then he had a fling with fellow TV chef Marcela Valladolid and all hell broke loose.Sex sells. It always has. So does scandal, and cheating on your we with a younger woman fits firmly into both categories.When the fling ended, the admirably forgiving Alex took Paul back, but the marriage faltered again and he took up with a -year-old barmaid with a fondness for miniskirts and crop tops.What’s not to love for the hundreds of “paparazzo”who make a living from how many times their photo gets viewed online It’s not rocket science, is it  Earlier this year I spotted Judi Dench out supermarket shopping.Yes, that Judi Dench. Dame of the British Empire. Oscar winner. Recipient of more awards than Mr Hollywood’s had hot buns.And favoured guest of chatshow host Graham Norton. But there she was, browsing the aisles and totally unbothered by anyone.Why  Well, firstly, she wasn’t wilfully drawing attention to herself by radiating self-importance. And secondly, while she’s paid to be dramatic on screen, her le outside of it is anything but.Meaning that, in everyday le, her showbiz currency — the aforementioned “clickbait” — is, depending on how you view such things, blissfully low.But , say, she decided to dump her conservationist partner David Mills for a young barman from her local pub, a photo of her low-key shopping trip would be front-page news. Simple really.Aside from the marvellous Ms Dench, there are oodles of A- listers who live non-famous lives, popping to the supermarket or going for a low-key dinner — for example, not The Ivy et al — with loved ones.Occasionally, they might be spotted and photographed, but they just keep their head down and ignore it, accepting that it’s a small price to pay for the myriad other benefits fame brings.NDAsare now commonly used by celebrities to ensure the silence of, say, a nanny who will be privy to what happens behind closed doors — and that’s perhaps understandable.But asking a lover to sign on the dotted line when you’ve already been together two years is saying, in so many words: “I don’t trust you, but I want to carry on sleeping with you.”Who can blame Summer for telling him to stick it where the sun don’t shine Famous US basketball coach and mentor, John Wooden , once said: “Talent is God given Be humble. Fame is man-given Be grateful. Conceit is self-given Be careful.”Wise words that Mr Hollywoodwould do well to heed.WHATEVER you think of Boris Johnson’s politics, it can’t be denied that he’s working his King Ashurbanipal socks offas our new PM.Hospitals, factories, flood-hit towns – you name it, he’s popping up there to put a smile on everyone’s face and reassure them that everything is under control.He’s the frontman while the rest of the bandare putting in the hours at the studio, hopefully producing the hits. Time will tell.But suffice to say, he’s already shaping up to be the UK’s cheerleader – a feat the more reserved and aloof Theresa May never quite managed.WHEN asked about children, Prince Harry replied that he and we Meghan might have “two, maximum”.Fair enough, I thought. After all, she’s  now and,she’s lucky, Mother Nature might let her conceive one more before her womb shuts shop.But no, it seems the royal couple’s decision is to do with population growth, despite experts saying that, globally, the birthrate is shrinking and the real issue is how long we’re all living.So unless he’s planning to pack Granny off to Dignitas, there’s not much he can do about it. But I digress.Regarding royal babies and, in particular, Harry and Meghan’s sensitivity around their firstborn’s privacy, perhaps they should copy his cousin Zara.She and husband Mike Tindall have two daughters, Mia, five, and Lena, one. There’s no showboating or churlishness, they just give their daughters as normal a le as possible via picnics, getting muddy, painting faces and rough and tumble – as seen in thisdelightful photo of mischievous Mia hitching a ride on Dad’s back.They occasionally get photographed, but clearly accept that it’s just one of those things and don’t let it bother them. A parenting template to be admired, whoever you are.THE author Alex Elle once said: “I am very cautious of people whose actions don’t match their words.”In which case, let’s hope she wasn’t invited to the recent Google Camp party in Sicily which,you’re one of the self-regarding A-listers in attendance, was a high-minded gathering to discuss the issue of climate change.Or to the rest of us – a boondoggle for entitled fools. How  to describe an event attended by  of some of the world’s richest people who arrived on eco-unfriendly private jets and luxury yachts Oh, the unacknowledged irony. Meanwhile, Leona Lewis and ious other celebrities, who advocate gun control, happily took a shilling or three to attend the Austria-based party of Gaston Glock – one of the world’s most famous gun makers.But back to Google Camp where – and I can’t quite believe I’m writing this – residents and hotel guests near the archaeological site of Selinunte were told by police to avoid looking out of their windows to protect the privacy of the invited A-listers dining al fresco.The same slebs, one assumes, who regularly virtue signal their moral credentials by advocating a world without borders, where everyone should be treated the same . . . yada yada. If hypocrisy was a movie, they’d all be winning Oscars.SCHOOLBOY Jay Hughes, , was talking to a friend outside a chicken shop in South London when a van pulled up and three men armed with machetes jumped out.His friend ran off and escaped but Jay stood in the shop doorway, where -year-old Nyron Jean-Baptiste stabbed him before boasting, “I got one”, and leaving the scene.Jean-Baptiste has now been jailed for “le” – whatever that means these days – while poor Jay’s distraught mother Cindy has been condemned to a letime of painful loss.Another devastated mother, Linda Burke-Monerville, spoke last month about sending her remaining children back to Nigeria for safety after losing three of her sons to violent crime in the UK.New Home Secretary Priti Patel said this week that she is resolutely focused on restoring law and order to our streets via extra police officers with greater powers.Talk is cheap – particularly when uttered by the majority of politicians.

An absolute nightmare.Ive not been able to go anywhere and Whaley is so quiet. Everyone in Whaley has been amazing. Its not easy.Asked what it was like to be one of the first to be let back in, she said: Its great. I can finally get some sleep. I just cant wait to get back in my flat.Im happy but on the other side Im gutted for those who cant come back.They joined  diehard locals in the Horwich End area who defied the evacuation order to stay - despite repeated pleas by cops for them to leave as there is still a “risk to le”.Dep Ch Cons Swann said: “We will repeatedly visit these people to remind them of the risks they are posing to themselves and emergency responders.“However there is no specic legislation under which we can force these people to leave.”The four determined families all live next to each other in Horwich End - and claim the slow trickle of people back into the area has proved they were right to stay.Malcolm Venton, , who stayed with partner Lorraine Ellis, , told MailOnline: Its vindicated us really, I felt that we were never in much danger and thats proven to be the case.A police woman this morning asked meI was was one of those refusing to move and I sad yes.She said that I was foolish and told me well be the ones who have to retrieve your bodies.We were only just within the evacuation zone andanything were to happen, I had a bag packed and the car parked outside to drive literally  yards or so up the hill to the safe area.It didnt seem worth all the hassle of moving out to a temporary shelter, particularly as one of our border collies, Meg, is sick at the moment and is limping and so hardly able to move.All that upheaval wouldnt have been fair on her.It is feared looters could hit the area with Derbyshire Police patrolling the ghost town with drones.The dam wall has been packed with  tonnes of aggregate which is being cemented into place to reinforce the spillway.Derbyshire Police said: “Once a level has been reached - and is able to be maintained - engineers will view the damage to the wall and a decision will be made regarding when it is safe for evacuated residents and businesses toto Whaley Bridge.”Fire chiefs have said specialist engineers have monitored the dam wall  hours a day with lasers and are reassured by their assessment.An RAF Chinook helicopter was used again yesterday to move sandbags in a bid to maximise the dam’s integrity.RAF Regional Liaison Officer for the North West, Wing Commander Gary Lane, said: The work we have done is just finding its feet.When you put a load of aggregate down it needs stamping in, weve not been able to flatten that because it has just been dropped.He said about  military personnel had been drafted in to help with the dam.Addressing what would happen once people are given the green light tohome, Ms Swann said all cordons would be lted and roads would go back to normal.In the meantime, she insisted that security measures were still in force in the area after reports of burglaries and prowlers.Ms Swann said: We can assure you that security of the area continues. We are using drones regularly to patrol the area.Members of the public at the meeting in Chapel High School, Chapel-en-le-Frith, were also told the dam would eventually have to be rebuilt.A spokesman for the Environment Agency said: We are very much in the emergency phase now and we are currently repairing and carrying out construction work.It is a long-term construction project, but we will not have started from scratch.

The reality is that maybe she only has time for one more.But, whether it’s for the environment or not, I don’t blame him for not wanting more than two children.I have two and the very idea of having had a third makes me feel weary. I’m just thinking of the sheer volume of childcare, laundry and meals required by each additional child.Sure, when it comes to considering whether two children is “enough”, Harry, left, and Meghan are dealing with dferent considerations to most of us.With hordes of staff, including nannies, cleaners and drivers, they could have multiple children and outsource ALL of the dficult stuffthey wanted to.But Harry and Meghan want to be hands-on parents — which can become exponentially harder with each child you have.Historically, there is pressure on Royal family members to have multiple kids.But, as with many other royal traditions, Harry and Meghan are planning to go their own way. And I commend them for that.I also think Harry should be applauded for speaking up about climate change, especially as this week the Met Office confirmed that the hottest years on record have occurred in the past ten years.So why shouldn’t he use his very public  to talk about things that matter to him and to try to inspire others But, as is often the case, this royal couple seem to be damnedthey do and damnedthey don’t.They’ve already learned the hard way — with their wedding their handling of Archie’s birth and their choice of residence — that you can’t please all the people all of the time.And that, in a way, is a liberation. Because all that is left is to please yourselves.  By ignoring pressures about how many children they “should” have, they are going to have as many as they damn well please.Although why they have to announce it is another question. Whatthey change their mind If they have two boys they might want to try for a girl. Apart from anything , you don’t know what your kids will ­contribute to the world.WhatThomas Edison’s parents had given up after two  .

And, of course, his career really is the gt that keeps on giving – mostly to the Mission: Impossible franchise.So it’s hard not to be annoyed by the take home from that.

For the sake of their Parliamentary careers, most of them keep quiet.But there are also deeper factors at work.One is mainstream Labour’s horror at any supposed betrayal of the socialist cause.This is partly because Labour is such a tribal movement, as shown in the ferocious anger generated in  by Ramsay MacDonald’s decision to break with the party by forming a National Government with the despised Tories.Since then treachery is regarded as the greatest sin, far worse than incompetence or unpopularity.This trait particularly insulates Corbyn, who, for all his spectacular failings, is still regarded by the majority of the membership as an authentic socialist.There is also a deep streak of sentimentality in Labour, which stems from the party’s origins in the trade union movement.In this mindset of supposed compassion, sacking people is what the bosses do, not the workers.When the nondescript Clement Attlee was surprisingly elected Labour leader in , supporters of his rival Herbert Morrison tried to comfort him by saying Attlee’s spell at the top would be short-lived.Morrison was having none of it.The party, he said, was sentimental and having once made a man leader, would stick to him.He was right. Attlee was still in post  years later.Sentimentality explains why so many anti-leadership plots are botched.I saw this for myself working as a Labour researcher at Westminster in the late s and early s, when there were hidden manoeuvres against Kinnock.But they all came to nothing because the plotters lacked the determination to finish the job.The same was true during Gordon Brown’s woeful premiership, when conspirators abandoned the battle when the moment came to strike.More interested in dogma than office, the Labour party lacks the unsparing instinct for power that infuses the Tories, which helps to explain why the Conservatives have been in Government for twice as long. Since  , the Tories have been in office for  years and Labour for just .The absence of hard ambition means that socialists are willing to put up with a dud like Corbyn, while they mouth their slogans and wave the red flag.The wilderness is their ideological comfort zone – and Corbyn will ensure they remain there."},{"url":null,"title":"michael gove eu brexit talks","story":"The leading Cabinet minister said it was “wrong and sad” that the EU did not want to discuss a new deal with the UK.His comments came after European leaders finally realised that Boris is serious about leaving without an agreement – but still do not want to offer a new solution to the Irish border problem.Speaking after a meeting of the daily Brexit “war cabinet”, Mr Gove said: “I’m deeply saddened the EU now seem to be refusing to negotiate with the UK.“The Prime Minister’s been clear, he wants to negotiate a good deal with the European Union and he will apply all the energy of the government and ensure that in a spirit of friendliness we can negotiate a new deal.”Mr Gove – who as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is in charge of No Deal preparations across Government – added: “At the moment it’s the EU that seems to be saying they’re not interested’, they’re simply saying, ‘no, we don’t want to talk’.“Well I think that’s wrong and sad, it’s not in Europe’s interest.”On a visit to Belfast, Ireland’s premier repeated the EU’s line that the Withdrawal Agreement could not be reopened.Leo Varadkar said that a No Deal exit was not guaranteed, however.“There are many ways by which a No Deal can be avoided.

The department said the visit to the London attraction - offering teams the chance to experience the challenge of the popular Channel  game show presented by comedian Richard Ayoade - was needed to get away from the distractions of the office.Details obtained by MailOnline under freedom of information laws showed the department booked  tickets costing a total of £,. on April  last year for a visit on May .At the time the department was being criticised over allegations of wrongly deporting Windrush generation migrants - which prompted the resignation of then home secretary Amber Rudd on April .    The department has moved to stress the team-building trip was unrelated to the scrutiny it faced over the scandal. The FOI response said: This was a team-building event for a team which had undergone signicant recent restructuring and recruitment. The Crystal Maze event afforded an opportunity to rebuild team cohesion in an environment away from distractions of the office. The Home Office would not comment on whether more money was spent on travel and food for staff during the trip. James Roberts, political director of the TaxPayersapos Alliance, told MailOnline it was a truly puzzling waste of taxpayersapos cash, adding: Splashing public money on a costly day out at the Crystal Maze, when surely a simple team lunch could have sufficed, shows some bureaucrats have truly lost their way when it comes to cutting down on wasteful spending.

Joan and Jack Bare celebrated their landmark last week. The pair, who married on August , , recently moved into a care home in Codsall, Staffordshire - but refused to leave each other and made sure they moved into a shared apartment after both suffering a fall at home weeks before. And although never spending time apart in  years might sound dficult for some couples, Joan, , and Jack, , say itaposs the reason their marriage has lasted such a long time. Their only daughter, Gill Skelton, , said: Mum and dad never spent a single night apart after the war.    They got married just a month before war broke out and dad was initially posted to Portsmouth. Mum was so worried about him that I donapost think they ever wanted to be apart after that. Even earlier this year when they both had a fall, they only agreed that they would go into a home where they could be together, they wonapost be parted. Joan and Jack, who were originally from Kendal, Cumbria, got married on the rd of August  after meeting a few years earlier in a cycling club. Jack served in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers and served in the south of England as well as Italy during the allied invasion.    Daughter Gill who has herself been married to her husband Tony, , for  years, said: “They met at a cycling club, while mum was going out with someone  but she met dad and that was it. “They both did cycling for years and swimming as well. “Mum was very worried when he got sent to Portsmouth because because there were a lot of bombs dropping. I think she just wanted him to be back at home with her, so when he came home, they didnapost let each other go.  “They both had a fall earlier this year so social services decided they couldn’t live alone any longer. They insisted they would stay together. The pair used to travel a lot around Europe and Joan during their trips Joan was teaching English nuns in Italy. The pair have two granddaughters, Jane and Caroline and four great-grandchildren Toby, , Charlotte,, Isabel,  and Reuben,. Jack, who worked as an engineer, designed and made the radar for Donald Cambell’s ‘Bluebird’, the same he used in his attempt to break his water speed record.  At some point Joan used to work for her father who was a butcher but then she became a spirella corsetiere, visiting people at their home, measuring them for corsets. When it comes to the secret of their marriage, they say that they did argue but always tried to work through their dferences. Joan said: I donapost feel like itaposs been a long time. Sometimes I wonder where the time has gone but then I look at my great-grandchildren and I realise. My advice is to talk about things and donapost go to sleep angry.

Kiran and Dignity Mojo and their son were allegedly allowed to rush through check-in and security without boarding passes at Amsterdamaposs Schipol Airport following flight delays. But as they got to the gate they were stopped by BA staff, according to witness Joshua Arthur. Mr Arthur says a white Englishman was allowed to go through the gates for the London-bound flight, even though he didnapost have a boarding pass either. In footage, Mrs Mojo is seen pointing at a white man and saying to airport staff: This man has got a ticket - he hadnapost checked in. I donapost understand why we are being... before she tails off.  Mr Mojo then adds: Theyaposre displacing us aswe are the criminals. A woman, who appears to be dressed in BA unorm is then heard in the background saying about there being rules that they need to follow. But Mrs Mojo replies, while pointing at the man again: This man hadnapost checked in either. BA gate staff then reportedly called airport police, who escorted the young family away from the gate. Another video shows an airport policeman saying to another passenger: “I am now asking you nicely to move”, before pushing the passenger backwards.  A BA spokesperson has confirmed they are investigating the claims. The incident happened as the London couple got ready to board the Gatwick-bound flight on July  following a family holiday. Kiran, an NHS pharmacist, said: “This entire experience has left us mentally exhausted and quite frankly traumatised and humiliated. We were treated in such an inhumane, degrading and disrespectful way in front of a plane full of passengers waiting to board. “I pray to God he [The baby] won’t remember this level of discrimination.” The man who Mrs Mojo had been pointing to did not seem to react in the video but he was seen posing next to her later on.   Mr Arthur documented the incident and shared it on Instagram .He wrote: “Due to flight delay, a couple and their three-month-old baby hadn’t checked in yet, which resulted in them not getting their boarding passes. “The same thing happened to an English man. The airport staff understood the situation and let them all through security anyways. “However, at the boarding gate, the British Airways workers let the English man on the plane, but wouldn’t let the couple and their baby board - even though the airport staff had already let them through security without a boarding pass.  “Us, passengers filmed what happened at the boarding gate for evidence. When the British Airways workers found out they threatened us by saying that we weren’t allowed to board the plane, unless they saw us delete the video.” Mr Arthur said today that he believes the young couple were racially discriminated against.

Now a cousin of the convicted killer - who was jailed for at least  years - has revealed Porton would steal from her grandmother as a teenager, lash out viciously at her siblings and later bragged about how much she earned as a prostitute. She alienated herself from the rest of her family by refusing to visit her grandmother on her deathbed - and then snubbed her funeral days later, leaving her loved ones furious with her selfishness.

My nan was always a good judge of character, when you introduced her to new partners she could always tellsomeone wasnapost right, and sheaposd turn out to be right. Her grandmother began to notice things going missing whenever Porton visited her - but was met with a furious reaction when she asked about it. Every time she left my nan would say such-and-such has gone from the table, the cousin said. Nan asked hershe was taking things, but she just said: aposIf you accused me of that Iaposll never come around again.apos  She was quite an angry child, and it got worse when she was a teenager. She was always after money. Louise never apologised for anything. Porton was often violent toward her cousin when she was young, the relative claimed.

When the killer was , her cousin claimed, her mum Sharon walked out on her to be with another man, leaving her dad to raise the three children alone. She said Louise cut her mum off for years, and was deeply affected by what happened.  As she got older, her cousin said family members became worried about her relationships with men, as she started showing signs of the sex addiction thought to have motivated the killings years later. Once she started sleeping with people, she was sleeping with anyone and everyone, anyone showing her attention, especiallythey had money, the relative said. I told her she needs to think about what sheaposs doing, but she said: aposI know what Iaposm doing, I know how to look after myself.apos The dficult relationship with her family came to a head when Joy became ill and doctors said she was not going to recover. Despite knowing her grandmother had just hours to live, Porton refused to visit her, and later snubbed the funeral as well. Her cousin said: When nan was in hospital she was the only one who wouldnapost come. I contacted Louise and told her theyaposve given nan less than  hours but she said aposI canapost make itapos.  I told her it was her last chance, she said aposI heard what you said, but Iaposm not comingapos. I just put the phone down, I was so emotional.

I rang her the night before the funeral, she said she wasnapost coming because she was breastfeeding Lexi, the relative said. I said I would organise a private area for her, but she said no. The whole family was disgusted, they cut her off after that because she was so selfish.  She was always there when my nan was giving out pocket money, but she wasnapost there when she needed her. As a result of the feud, the cousin never met Portonaposs younger daughter, Scarlett. Things got worse, she said, when she spotted Porton bragging on Facebook about how much money she could make by selling sex. Appalled, the cousin messaged her, but never received a reply. She said: I messaged her on Facebook and about it, I told her she was disgusting. She never replied to that message, I told her sheaposs a disgrace and nan would be turning in her grave. In spite of the feud, Portonaposs cousin said she sent her a message when she heard Lexi had died in January last year. Lexi died on January  last year, little more than two weeks before Scarlett was killed on February .  Lexi was so sweet, she was a lovely cute thing, Portonaposs cousin said. When I heard sheaposd died I messaged Louise and said I was so sorry for her loss, but she never replied. But she knew something wasnapost right when she learned of Scarlettaposs death. I said to my mum that something isnapost right, how can you lose two babies in two weeks  she revealed. On Friday a judge at Birmingham Crown Court handed Porton a le sentence, with a minimum term of  years - meaning she will be in her s when she becomes eligible for parole. Itaposs a shame we donapost have the death penalty in this country, her cousin said.

The culprit  The bride had been drinking healthy so-called detox shakes to banish last-minute bloating and theyaposd wreaked havoc on her digestive system on her actual big day.The horror story was recounted on Reddit by the wedding planner who had assisted the bride both in the run-up and on the day.   As some background, she explained that the couple had opted for a rural shabby chic aesthetic in a historic barn, which necessitated having portaloos.She adds: The bride had, to be honest, been quite a bridezilla , but itaposs my job to deal with those things. At this point, the ceremony had ended, cocktail hour is shutting down, professional photos were taken.We were prepping to transition to the entrance of the bridal party, which would be followed immediately by first dance and cake cutting. During this, the dinner would be staged, so every aspect was being fairly A few moments later, my headset beeped on, and my assistant said aposwe have an issueapos. It turns out that the bride had gambled on a fart and lost in a big way.   Perhaps things might have been dferent, were it not for the style of wedding dress the bride had gone for.It was a huge ballgown with hoops and slips underneath, while the corset was a boned bodice. There was no way they could get her to the bathroom in time, the wedding planner revealed. So she told everyone to expect a delay of fteen minutes. Then her assistant bleeped her again. aposThe previous issue is more than we anticipated.apos I ran over to find my assistant looking horried. The sakes the bride had been using had mixed poorly with the cocktails from earlier, and she had eaten a fairly decent breakfast. The substance that had come out of her body as a result defied explanation. It was slimy, oily even, with stringy bits and the consistency of hair gel.    Not only had it been a rather profound accident, but the smell was unrivaled. Generally, a substance no human body should emit. But the thing that set it over the edge was that the shaper the bride wore was a latex deal that came down over the thighs and up to her bra. Waterproof, the poo had just sort of filled it, like a water balloon of horror. My assistant had opened up the snap crotch and just released the evil trickling down the brides thighs. My assistant quickly sealed it back up and she and the bride vainly tried to wipe up the goo, dry, with toilet paper. Unsurprisingly, the assistant was in complete shock, bride was crying and she didnapost smell great.  However, the brideaposs chief concern was keeping the guests waiting and everything running according to schedule. The show must go on is the brideaposs motto, so despite diarrhoea still being embedded in her nail bed and a groom vaguely disconcerted by his new weaposs odour the choreographed dance goes ahead. She continues: As the groom spun his bride around, hand on her waist, he is squishing the poo up the insides of the waist trainer, up and out the back waistband. To our horror, we watch as a oily stain spread across the mid back of the gown. As we are still cringing from this, the groom sets his hand firmly in the middle of the poo stain.

Plus thereaposs the dominance that the person has over you when they are wedgieing you. Thereaposs nothing you can do, you just have to deal with the pain - someone having that much power over you is exhilarating. Bobby said he receives a wedgie around every other week, although it ies. He spends hundreds a month on his fetish but says he can afford it as he works in the city. How much I pay slightly depends on how good the wedgie is, he said. The most I have spent is £ for one where these two women ripped my pants off in Hyde Park on a busy summer afternoon.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

He turned Duncan MacKinnon inside-out before flicking an inch-perfect ball to Fraser Watt on the left of the D and he slammed the ball high into the middle of the goal from  yards to make it -.Lochaber had their first shot on goal on six minutes when Ben Delaney found space on the left but his strike went wide of the left-hand post.Inveraray were showing good movement up front and they increased their advantage on nine minutes. The goal came from a corner and Garry MacPherson caught the Lochaber defence napping as he played the ball low from a wide area towards the front post where full centre Lewis MacNicol waltzed into the box and his first-time shot beat the helpless Callum MacDonald to make it -.Lochaber keeper MacDonald pulled off a great save on  minutes as he blocked Garry MacPherson’s fine drive from the left with his chest before clearing the ball to safety.Lochaber’s Ben Delaney and Stuart Callison tested Inveraray keeper Scott MacLachlan but it was the Winterton side who would add a third goal on  minutes. Again the goal came from Lewis MacNicol winning possession, this time deep in Lochaber territory, and he found the ever-alert Garry MacPherson whose defence-splitting pass picked out Fraser Watt running in unmarked through the heart of the Lochaber defence and he slotted the ball low past the keeper from close range.Lochaber were now up against it but, on  minutes, Conor Sweeney took a corner from the right, sending the ball into the danger-area. Stuart Callison found space to slam the ball goalwards and although Scott MacLachlan saved with his feet, he was unable to get the ball away and Ben Delaney was quick to react as he poked the ball over the line to make it - at the interval and give Lochaber hope.Lochaber started the second period with intent and Scott MacLachlan pulled off a great save to thwart Stuart Callison on  minutes.However, Lochaber’s never-say-die attitude got them right back into the match with just  minutes remaining. Lachlan Campbell played the ball across from the right and it came perfectly to the on-running Findlay MacDonald and his  yard shot from the left flew past the keeper to make it -, setting up a tense finishLochaber had a great chance to snatch a point on  minutes when referee John Angus Gillies awarded them a spot-hit, penalising keeper MacLachlan for a “kick” inside the D. Ben Delaney’s well-struck effort went straight down the middle and MacLachlan redeemed himself, saving superbly with his stick before clearing the ball for a corner.Inveraray saw out the rest of the game to claim two valuable points in what was a cleanly fought contest with no cards shown.The win sets Inveraray up for another crucial relegation battle this time at Kilmallie this coming Saturday.Caberfeidh  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from behind to beat Caberfeidh - in their pm throw up at Castle Leod.Caberfeidh have been on a bit of a scoring spree of late and they took the lead in the opening minute through Craig Morrison.It didn’t take Kyles long to level with Ross MacRae netting on  minutes and Colin MacDonald’s effort on  minutes meant they went into the break - ahead.Ross MacRae got his second on  minutes with Colin MacDonald doing like-wise with just  minutes remaining.Mowi South Division Inveraray  Kyles Athletic The Inveraray seconds and the Kyles Athletic seconds met in a match originally rearranged Thursday  July which was then put back  hours.Kane Kirkhope was playing in a more advanced role for Inveraray and he scored a well-taken goal in eight minutes after some impressive forward play.John MacKenzie was working hard in the middle of the park and he set up Inveraray’s second goal on  minutes.

Day one saw us head out from Carloway aboard the SYSAC II under the watchful eye of skippper Robbie Bell who knows these waters like the back of his hand.The day kicked off with a bait hunt in the East Loch but the mackerel were pretty scarce, it took an hour or so to fill the baskets before steaming out to the two-mile mark in search of spurdogs. By then there was a fair wee wind picking up and it was a tad rough to say the least, with the heavy swell claiming a few breakfasts along the way.All that was soon forgotten as the battle commenced with the mighty spurs. The action started on the first drop with some thumpers coming aboard, single and double shots causing mayhem thrashing about the deck and we lost count of the number of rigs sliced through on the way up. But that’s what we came for, not everyone’s choice but great sport all the same.In between the madness we picked away at the haddock, whiting, grey and red gurnard, ling and pollack, until we had our quota and decided to seek the smoother waters of East Loch Roag for some flattie bashing on the soft ground. It was good to get into the calm and fish the light gear, picking away for dabs and plaice. There was plenty around, nothing huge but a steady flow coming aboard taking us to the end of the day with a good mixed bag of species.Day two set off in brilliant sunshine and not a breath of wind, it was almost tropical conditions. We quickly got our supply of fresh bait in West Loch Roag and set off for the rough ground in search of a few more species, but there was little or no drt so we took a turn into Clf Bay and settled in for a day on the rays. It was brilliant fun, everyone got their fair share with loads of thornback rays and a few spotted rays coming aboard, plenty of dabs, plaice, dogfish and a bonus lb oz turbot to add to the tally. It was a great opportunity to brush up on some of fishing techniques that don’t get practised much at home.We decided to hit the hard ground on the way back to the harbour. It was quite slow, maybe a wee bit early yet, but it produced more haddock, a lovely lb cuckoo wrasse and pollack bringing our two day adventure to an end. All in all another excellent club trip.This year we picked up  species,  counting fish and a few personal bests. Add to that, great company, loads of banter, a good skipper who makes a mean cup o’ tea and you have the ideal ingredients for another memorable few days away on Lewis. We’ll be back next year for sure.Results: Nikki Thompson  points, Robert MacBrayne , Nick Friel , Jim Smith , Gary Sinclair , Steven MacBrayne ."},{"url":null,"title":"mach1 scottish tarmack rally championship report","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWith  starters and  Cobble shop STRC registered the championship tables were always going to change on this mid-season two day event.Sunshine was forecast for the Machrihanish Airbase Community Companycourse and that’s what was delivered.

Last year’s winner Bruce Edwards in the Darrian T GTR was favourite and since Bruce had not driven the car competitively since Mach   we all thought he would be a bit rusty.Bruce led from the start and set some impressive times throughout the two days but on the last stage he threw it all away and rolled the car as he clipped a large lorry tyre a mile from the finish line, unable to right the car and with the stage blocked the clerk of the course decided on the grounds of safety to cancel the final stage. This allowed Alistair Inglis in the lotus Exige and a previous Mach  winner to clinch the top spot.Class  had  STRC registered this year and new to class  was Tom Blackwood in the gorgeous yellow and Black Fiesta R+.

Tom finished third Overall and second in class .John Rintoul in another Fiesta R on the back of the recent win at Crail was on it all weekend but just couldn’t clinch the win this year, John finished second overall and took the class win.Alan Wallace in the distinctive green and white Mitsubishi Evo finished a very well deserved th overall and third in class.

Harry kept it neat all day and came away with rd overall after day one.Day two was very fast.

The service crew managed to bolt it up again but the long stages were killing it and it usually faded about  rds in each time.On Sunday he decided to push on a bit and of course it bit him. The interior mirror fell off and he became aware there was a car coming up behind after a merge but wasn’t sure how close. He decided to do the next lollipop and then see where he was on the straight but in his enthusiasm got to him and he understeered into the bales bouncing off them, hitting his bonnet. He also noticed the brake pads were rattling more than usual and it turned out they had lost a pin. The team had to improvise with spare tyre borrowed from Allan Wallace which didn’t quite fit but they wired it in and it lasted.Class  had  STRC registered crews this year and top spot and current championship leader in class went to Colin Gemmell in the Mark  Escort. Colin had a trouble-free run on both days and managed to finish the event th overall just  seconds behind Tom Blackwood and second in class.Alistair Inglis winner of the  Mach  stages kept just ahead all weekend. Nothing could touch his car which stuck to the road like glue.Inglis said: #Overall victory and a class win  Can’t get any better.#Robert Marshall in the Mark  Escort was looking forward to some decent results but an issue on day one with the car losing all its water put an end to any real chances and on day two an engine mount broke putting an end to what Robert described as a perfect weekend.Ross Auld was a welcomethe Mark  Escort and also managed a couple of days assistance in setting up the venue. Ross had managed to set some decent times on Saturday but late in the day the alternator belt snapped and took with it the dry sump belt causing the engine to cease. Ross loaded up the car and headed home and by the Sunday evening he had the engine out the car ahead of its rebuild.Class  saw four STRC registered crews compete in Kintyre this year and top of the list was Greg Inglis in the Lotus Exige. Greg exited the last stage on the Saturday and noticed the rear brake calliper hanging off. A call was made to Montrose where a spare part was removed from a car and the handover was done half way between Montrose and Machrihanish. Greg finished a respectful fth overall and took the class win.Second in class and th overall was Michael Harbour in the Mark  Escort, on the back of electrical problems that saw the team fail to finish the last round at Crail the team have now got the car singing on the stages. Michael didn’t report any issues during the weekend and brought the car home in one piece.Michael Robertson isn’t having the best of luck this season as the Honda Civic Type R driver reported issues with the CV joint that led to driveshaft and df failure but as usual the team loved the event and will be back for sure.Class , with eight registered STRC in class  the battles were all tensely close. Taking top honours in the class was Kyle Adam a full two minutes ahead of nearest class  car of Des Campbell. Kyle also managed a top  overall clinching th spot and despite some overheating at one point the car ran faultlessly doing his championship hopes no harm.Lochgilphead local, Jamie Miller in the C R Max loves the track and had the luxury of booking indoor servicing. With navigator Ian McCulloch, his biggest problems were brake related but with some fluid changes and adjustments it was just all back to normal for the team finishing a well-deserved th overall and fourth in class.Kayleigh Strachan in the Citroen Saxo finished th in class on the event and th overall but managed to pick up  points and th in class in the STRC.Gary Coutts in the Fiesta commented after the final stage on the Sunday that on the second to last stage of day one he developed a few ‘minor’ issues. A change of driveshaft, ball joint, wheels and tyres seemed to cure the problem. With an early start on the Sunday morning the car was back on form. Loss of intercom on way to stage  and a half spin on stage  cost them a bit of time and after a few tweaks at service they were away again. The last stage of the day was cancelled resulting in a th overall and th in class.Alan Watt was again out in the green Saxo and finished th in class and st overall. A great result for the team with no damage or mechanical issues to report.Class  had four teams registered in the STRC this year at Mach  but only one managed to finish. Martin Farquhar in the  didn’t have any issues to report with the car and managed first in class in the STRC but second in class on the event and th overall.Event Overall and Class winners: st Overall Alistair Inglis Colin Inglis Lotus Exige ., nd Overall John Rintoul Ross Hynd Ford Fiesta R ., rd Overall Tom Blackwood Gordon Winning Ford Fiesta R+ ..Class  Martin Farquhar Aiden Henderson Peugeot  .Class  Kyle Adam Fiona Moir Ford Escort Mk .Class  Greg Inglis Steven Brown Lotus Exige .Class  Colin Gemmell Richard Crozier Ford Escort Mk .Class  John Rintoul Ross Hynd Ford Fiesta R ."},{"url":null,"title":"shinty report 2 8 19","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMowi PremiershipKilmallie  Inveraray Kilmallie moved two points away from the relegation zone after beating bottom side Inveraray - in their pm throw up at the Canal Parks.Kilmallie’s Innes Blackhall missed out through suspension but Michael Rodger ed to the squad.Inveraray were badly hit by suspension.

It would be hard not to notice the single imposing figure of the dersquoil amongst the floral sea of youngsters.John Cockburn, clad in a black cloak and hood, carried the fiery red head of the dersquoil mounted on the top of a stout pole draped in red cloth. Itrsquos an eerily unnerving sight that Irsquom sure sent shivers down the spine of many since it was carved in .To the sounds of the pipes and trumpets, local bands joined the parade which halted briefly near the top of Waverley Road for Dux Boy Aaron Glendinning to hang a wreath at the wall plaque commemorating John Euman, who acted as Master of Ceremonies at the Cleikum for almost  years.This ceremony was repeated at the plaques on the wall of the Burgh Chambers to former Games Chairman Walker McLaren and John A Anderson, one of the instigators of the Cleikum Ceremony.An act of kindness was carried out at the end of the parade as children handed their flowers to committee members which would be delivered to local hospitals.The procession, which opened the nd Anniversary of St Ronanrsquos Border Games, took the form of a massed bands display. St Ronanrsquos Silver Band and Peebles Burgh Silver Band combined to present a most impressive march along Innerleithen High Street just after the Race Roond the Toon.Large crowds lined both sides of the High Street to witness this spectacle. The march played was The Pride of Princes Street. Huge crowds gathered on both sides of the street to support both of Innerleithenrsquos fine bands and to enjoy the music at this yearrsquos Beating of the Retreat.Presiding over the performance was the President of St Ronans Border Games Alan Patterson along with St Ronan and the Dux Girl, Standard Bearer Ronan Caine and Lass Caitlin Urquhart, their supporters, Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James, and his we Sarah, the monks, and the dersquoil.The two town bands marched on together under the expert direction Band Sergeant David Lindsay playing Scotland the Brave. The Pipe Band then performed an excellent Drummerrsquos Call followed by the traditional Retreat marches Greens Hills of Tyrol, The Battles Oer and Lochanside.Next the Silver Band played an upbeat version of the Queen hit, Fat Bottomed Girls which featured one of the bandrsquos percussionists, Cameron McCreadie, on drum kit and soprano cornet player, Simon Railton, as soloists.The Pipe Band followed on with a rendition of their new competition medley set comprising a iety of time signatures, featuring an emotional arrangement of the slow air Mingulay Boat Song.More marches back and forth had the crowds clapping and tapping their feet before it was time for the combined piece, which was a beautul arrangement of The Rose of Kelvingrove featuring Pipe Major Gillie as soloist. The Silver Band then rendered Sunset with Callum Anderson and Callum Robb sounding the calls. The hymn tune Eventide was played by principal cornet player, Callum Robb, and conducted by Band Secretary Keith Belleville.Games President Alan Patterson then gave permission for the Bands to take their leave. To resounding applause, the bands marched off playing On, StRonans, On!.There was only one important task that remained, the matter of the dersquoil. We were honorary torch bearers lighting the way for our neighbours the St Ronanites, to burn an effigy of the dersquoil.I quickly ran to the High Street for a prime view of the black cloaked carrier of the dersquoil, monks dressed in their habits chanting and punching their croziers in the air, Standard Bearer Ronan carrying the Blue Banner. The magic of this ancient tale was brought to le. I can only compare it to watching the village mob with torchlights off to kill the beast in the classic Disney film.The friendly Innerleithen mob halts on Hall Street and the dersquoil strangely disappears out of sight.I think of the Cleikum Ceremony and remark to my husband, who carried out the duties of the Dux Boy in, how nice it is that the old customs and traditions exist today, said exactly as it was since its inception in .He recalls word for word the outgoing speech of the Dux Boy which makes me think back to the words of Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James: ldquoInnerleithen and the Games will be in your DNA forever. Never a truer word. You can take the man out of Innerleithen but yoursquoll never take Innerleithen out of the boy!We begin the climb of Curly Hill to the soul-stirring sounds of the Pipe Band. It is dark and the fire-lit torches have been extinguished. The climb feels never-ending and locals start to sing On St Ronanrsquos On. We finally reach the top and, as I look out over the valley, it is simply breathtaking. Some things are better felt that telt.My eyes are drawn to the dark figure that sits on the pyre. A haunting figure approaches bearing a flame, St Ronan has ed in the form of Aaron Glendinning. The pyre bursts into flames and the crowds on the hillside cheer the effigyrsquos fiery demise. Fireworks then light up the dark sky.The dersquoil is now in ashes and the evil spirit has been banished once more. And I, along with the people of Innerleithen, head safely home after truly enchanting evening."},{"url":null,"title":"cyclists-set-leg-lavender-touch","story":"A CYCLING team which has raised tens of thousands of pounds for charity is preparing for its toughest challenge yet.The Over The Hill cyclists are in serious training ahead of their  Border Settlements which will see them complete  miles over three days.The nine-man team - which includes Keith Irvine, Stevie Halls, Sinclair Paterson, Ronnie Murray, Josh Irvine, Kevin Mania, Alan Brown, Doug Welsh and Chris Lightfoot - are tackling the route for the Lavender Touch, a charity which raises funds for people in the Scottish Borders living with cancer.The team have previously cycled  miles from Settle in Yorkshire to Galashiels in aid of Prostate Scotland in , and  miles for the Rowan Boland Memorial Trust in .Stevie Halls said: \"The team, which has an age range of mid-s to over , will be passing through over  towns, villages and hamlets in a journey of  miles across the Borders.\"The route mirrors the geographic reach of the Lavender Touch and although our trip will only last three days, the impact we hope to raise through sponsorship and donations will allow the Lavender Touch to continue to support patients for years to come.\"We will be supported across the Borders by a tour bus which will follow the route and stop off at many towns and villages where the Lavender Touch volunteers will be holding a number of events to promote the charitys work.\"The cyclists head off on Friday, August  and hope to reach Gala Cricket Club before the close of play on until Sunday, August .Local businesses can advertise on the side of tour bus -interested, contact Keith Irvine .Donations can be made to the Over the Hills team at www.lavendertouch project over_the_hill_elite_riders "},{"url":null,"title":"garden-delights-opens-peebles","story":"A NEW community garden in Peebles was officially opened last week.Tesco store manager Tracy Wilson was given the honour of cutting the ribbon at the Gutterbluids Societyrsquos Dovecot Community Garden.A grant from the Tescos Bags for Help scheme along with local donations helped fund the project on land at the junction of Dovecot Road and March Street.Andrew Fraser, secretary of Peebles Gutterbluids Society told us: \"The project would not have been possible without a pound grant received from Tescorsquos Bags of Help Scheme, and the firmrsquos willingness to allow the project to go ahead on their land.\"The pound grant, plus a few generous local donations, paid for the  small, ornamental trees which were required for the garden.\"Tescorsquos local Community Champion, Pauline Weir, was very supportive of the project and was keen that bench-seats should be included in the plans.\"Two bench seats were also donated by local iniduals and have been refurbished, plus two new seats were kindly donated, one by the Rotary Club of Peebles, and the other by private donors.\"Gutterbluids Society members and a few friends planted out the five groves of trees early last December.And each of the saplings was in blossom this spring.As well as its aesthetic appeal the new garden is also benefitting nature.Mr Fraser added: ldquoThe grass in amongst the tree groves has been left deliberately to grow, providing a natural area for pollenating insects, etc, and a surprising number of wild flowers are growing there.\"Our bench-seats are proving popular, - and not only for human use.\"As a result we have had to install lsquopigeon perchesrsquo behind two of the seats, in a bid to stop them perching on the seat backs and defacing them.

It is bounded to the west by Montgomerie Terrace.ldquoThe proposed new development will be accessed via a new access created off Montgomerie Terrace, with the two new houses towards the front of the site, which replace the existing ldquodoran pre-fab and former canoe shed, accessed off the B.ldquoThese proposed homes reflect high standards of design to ensure successful integration with the character of the local area, without damaging the design characteristics of the conservation area.ldquoThe materials, scale and height of the surrounding area have all been assessed to ensure the proposed development is in keeping with the existing housing.The plans attracted five objections relating to the height of the buildings in relation to nearby properties, and raised issues surrounding privacy and sunlight.However, at a meeting of Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday August , planning officers urged councillors to approve the plans.In a written submission to the committee, planning officer Julie Hayward writes: ldquoThe main issue with the development is the potential impact of the dwellinghouses proposed on plots five and seven on the light, privacy and outlook of Orchard House to the east due to the position of the proposed houses and dfering ground levels.ldquoThe agent has submitted a drawing to show the relationship between the three houses and section drawings showing ground levels.ldquoIn terms of the impact of the proposed house on plot seven, the proposed house would have two bedroom windows in the east elevation at ground floor level and would be on slightly lower ground. Applying the guidelines in the approved supplementary planning guidance, there would be no signicant loss of light or privacy to Orchard House from this property.ldquoIn terms of the impact of the house on plot five on Orchard house, the garage would be positioned on the eastern side of the proposed house and the decking is shown on the western side beyond the rear wing.ldquoThere would be a window and door to the garage and a window to a WC in the rear elevation, which are not considered to be habitable rooms. There would be a large glazed area in the rear wing serving the living room.ldquoThe house is on signicantly higher ground than Orchard House.ldquoAgain, when applying the approved guidance there would be no direct overlooking and no loss of privacy to the habitable rooms of Orchard House.Kelso councillor Simon Mountford said he did not object to the proposals, but wanted to see a design change: ldquoWhat we have here those very boring roof shapes, although I appreciate modern roofs do not have chimneys or anything to break them up a little bit.ldquoIrsquom wonderingwe could ask the developer to break up the roof lines with some new designs.Tweeddale West councillor Eric Small told the committee: ldquoIrsquom quite happy with the way itrsquos sited in this location, so Irsquom going to go with the officers on this one.

The central work was Mendelssohn’s Violin Concerto in which the orchestra’s Director, Benjamin Marquise Gilmore, played the solo part and gave a stunning performance.At the end of the first movement, the audience were treated to an outstanding display of professionalism from the orchestra, when one of the strings on the soloist’s violin snapped, but then watched the smoothest of transitions as the player at the first desk immediately handed the soloist her own violin and the music continued uninterrupted while another player repaired the broken string.The concert finished with Beethoven’s nd Symphony and it was especially good to hear the use of natural trumpets and horns in this early but most attractive work.

I had the romantic impression that the good folk of Campbeltown had been following the ious pro-independence rallies as they worked their way around the geography of Scotland and had just been waiting for their own town#s turn!The sun stayed out for us right until pm. Then the rain suddenly came down and we took down our Pensioners for Independence stall.  That evening Yes Kintyre put on a special party for us all with local musicians in the Argyll Arms Hotel.On Sunday some of us stayed on and explored your beautul peninsula. As the ferry pulled away that evening members of Yes Kintyre stood along the harbour wall holding up saltires to bid us farewell.Thank you all again for a memorable experience.Yours,Mary McCabe,Glasgow.Sir,It was my great privilege to attend yet another Open at Royal Portrush and to witness  year-old Oban golfer Robert MacIntyre finish tied sixth in his very first Major Championship.It was a wonderful performance, and confirmation, of the talent and the temperament we, the journalists, felt sure that he had.  He is now a Euro millionaire, but he remains an open, helpful and cheerful lad with both feet firmly planted on the ground, thanks to a great family and a strong desire to remain in his home town.I was at Glencruitten for the first time in June and soon discovered why Robert wants to go back there on a regular basis after weeks on tour.  It#s a terric club, no airs and graces.  They are very proud of Robert, and rightly so, but I very much doubtthey would allow him to lose his down-to-earth approach to international recognition.Yours,Jock MacVicar, Southend-born Scottishgolf correspondent and long-time Dunaverty member. Sir,Through the columns of your newspaper, may I express my grateful thanks to all the businesses, organisations, and iniduals, who donated to our fundraising, allowing the dancers to compete in the United States Highland Dancing Championships held recently in Las Vegas.We had a very successful trip, placing in both the Highland and choreography events.

Are the faces staring out from the pages of glossy magazines shining with wellbeing  They might be tanned, toned, and expensively exfoliated, butany of these iniduals has a heart full of joy, it is unlikely to be as a result of their lestyle.In a recent talk, Nicola Sturgeon made an appeal to commonsense, stating what, deep down, most of us already know. She claims that when calibrating a countryrsquos standing and success, gross domestic product is not the most accurate measure. Not least among the misleading factors when using GDP as a guide is that its figures ignore unpaid carersrsquo work, yet put a value on illegal drug consumption. Just as worryingly, says Ms Sturgeon, ldquoIt values activity in the short term that boosts the economy eventhat activity is hugely damaging to the sustainability of our planet in the longer term.The First Ministerrsquos laudable aspiration is that ldquothe objective of economic policy should be collective wellbeing ndash how happy and healthy a population is, not just how wealthy a population is. Hoping to establish a fairer and truer scale of assessment, she is collaborating with the prime ministers of New Zealand and Iceland ndash women all, in charge of countries geographically on the fringes, who are prepared to challenge convention.Cynics might, of course, say that Ms Sturgeon is simply laying the groundwork for another independence bid, in which those predicting dire financial consequences will be brushed off as old-fashioned and out of touch by placing too much emphasis on our economic prowess. Yet with Brexit, not just economists but rabid Leavers acknowledge that orce from the EU will cause financial shockwaves. Clearly, this is a risk they think worth running. By the same token, idealists north of the Border, who want us to exit from the UK, often say that the possibility of diminished economic performance after independence would not in itself be a deal breaker. There are bigger issues at stake.That argument is for another day. At this point, were Scotland to become a pioneer in putting a fairer society ahead of a more affluent one, this would represent nothing less than a second enlightenment. The inequalities in health and housing, education and attainment that are nakedly apparent all around us, are shaming for one of the wealthiest countries in the world. No matter how much those at the top make, or how vibrant our financial markets, poverty and desperate hardship for too many people persists. Itrsquos tempting to think that those who see GDP and similar indices as telling the whole story have also embraced the biblical creed that the poor will always be with us ndash in other words, there is nothing we can do about their plight.While the SNP has not been far-sighted or proactive enough to combat the recent shocking rise in drug-related deaths, many of them linked to deprivation and hopelessness, nevertheless Ms Sturgeon and the like-minded leaders with whom she is allied, have a strong social conscience. If the message that money is only part of the equation takes hold, it could potentially prove a turning point for the way all rich societies see, and regulate, themselves.Naturally therersquos a danger when writing disparagingly about high-income earners of appearing either green-eyed or preachy. Despite spending a childhood in the pews, hearing how the widowrsquos mite was as valuable as the millionairersquos cheque, and that those who are hard up today will be blessed with eternal treasures in the hereafter, I nevertheless know that no pair of rose-tinted spectacles can make a terrying bill, an unattainable holiday or too-expensive winter coat, one bit easier to bear. As Mae West put it bluntly: ldquoIrsquove been rich and Irsquove been poor, and rich is better.When it comes to wellbeing, you donrsquot need a carbon monoxide monitor to recognise that the air in Stornoway or St Abbs is far better for us than that in the throbbing financial hearts of Edinburgh or Glasgow, or for that matter Tokyo and New York. Wellbeing consists of something way beyond liquidity, location, or assets. Those in their gated communities, who store their Cartier watches in a vault, have cut themselves off from the rest of society. Is that really enviable  This is not to say they might not be really decent, kind-hearted people who give generously to good causes. Perhaps some of them are. But no matter how open-handed they appear to be, money creates a spiralling gulf between the haves and the have-nots, and sometimes cause rts much closer to home, as family lawyers will attest.Far from solving the problem by capitalistsrsquo pet theory of ldquotrickle-down, too much capital at the top of society actually entrenches inequality. Thus, the endless pursuit of higher incomes, pricier properties, competitive conspicuous consumption, whether at a personal or national level, is intrinsically unhealthy. Once you believe that the GDP graph should show an inexorable year-on-year increase, you become blinkered. This is as true, I suspect, for those running the country as for the inidual.Hunger for amassing hundreds of thousands of pounds, and the power that comes with it, is a recipe for potential disaster. It is psychologically and spiritually corrosive.

How do you sum up ldquoI worked my backside off to get one B and two Cs and now Irsquom going to college because university isnrsquot for me, it isnrsquot for lots of young people, and we shouldnrsquot be made to feel like second-class citizens because of it in one image Not so easy, not even with giant cardboard letters.Maybe triplets would help, on account of being able to hold up the most expansive flash cards.:SQA exam results: Pupils across Scotland to find out gradesRemembering exam hell should be a universal leveller, but of course, it isnrsquot because our education system is far from being a universal leveller.Some people will remember being well prepped by private tutors and surrounded by hard-working peers in an environment where results matter because results paid wages.Others will remember a teacher from another class sneaking in to write Ode to Autumn on the blackboard and having you memorise it ahead of the Higher English exam because she knew your actual class teacher just wasnrsquot that into the whole teaching thing and you were all likely going to fail without a dramatic intervention.Seasons of mists and mellow fruitfulness came in very handy for passing the exam, indeed, but then what While I cannot envy young people having to sit exams ndash never, never again, thank you ndash what I do envy them is the push to lay out all options before them.More and more young people from Glasgow now are going to Oxbridge ndash still in tiny numbers, but tiny increasing numbers.Not because pupils from days before were not achieving the necessary marks, but because now young people are being encouraged to see all options as open to them, no matter their class or background.Last year I interviewed a young woman from a Glasgow comprehensive who was going to study in America.I would never in a million years have thought that Oxbridge might have been possible for me, that New York or Calornia might have been possible for me.Irsquom so glad that we are telling our working class, state-educated young people that the world is really their oyster and that nothing is off-limits.University, though, is not for everyone, not even those who are high academic achievers. It would be wonderful, on results day,this was more widely recognised. That going to college or into the workplace with fewer Highers and National s had just as much value.There are pupils now getting six or seven Highers in the one year. This is a stellar achievement and, of course, down to hard work. But a degree of luck is involved that yoursquove happened to have been born with an academic brain.Some of us might work our very socks off and never be able to achieve six A grades. And what of those who feel six A s are a certainty but who come away with less than they were expecting This is where not listening to advice comes in. Everyone will be ready to step in with a story about how disappointment makes a person stronger. Or how an unexpected result pushed them on a path better than the route they planned to take. They will say that it is not the end of the world.Rot. It is the end of the world as you know it, whether the results are what you planned or not.It is the end of the time when exam results matter and when the next stage of le is yet to begin.After an intense and stressful time, studying, sitting exams, it very rapidly becomes apparent how the meaning of these results depreciates.People will tell you that, ultimately, school exam results cease to matter. Itrsquos a complicated argument because yes, practically, there will come a point when your Higher results simply do not matter any more, yet they will always matter as a step to what you do next.You have to decide for yourself how seminal these results are, how to make or break, and whether they mould you stronger or alter your plans for the better.I imagine it would help the decision-making processuniversity wasnrsquot perpetually touted as the highest marker of success.Exam results are only one marker of success.

Edinburgh was full of colour and noise, and there was a real sense of hope and expectation. Donald Dewar’s speech in the parliament’s first chamber was one of those moments where the hair stood up on the back of your neck. In my view – as someone in a dferent party to Donald, with very dferent views on the ultimate destination for Scotland – that speech was one of the finest speeches in modern Scottish history.How much of a privilege is it to run the country and how dficult is the top job There’s no doubt that being First Minister of Scotland has been the privilege of my le.

And like many people in senior positions, particularly women, I have had moments of self-doubt but I believe it’s important to be open about that and to be a role model to young people. But more than anything, I am grateful to have the opportunity to help make Scotland a better place to live.What is the Parliament’s biggest achievement in the last  years  Twenty years on there are so many achievements that we can be proud of, and that have made Scotland a better place to live, work, study and grow up in. From free personal care to the abolition of tuition fees, the ban on smoking in public places, a minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of equal marriage. There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers. There will also be live music, dancers, face painting and caricaturists.And of course, there will be birthday cake and food too. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “It will be a great day, full of colour and energy. Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic","story":"The final section of the Aberdeen bypass is not expected to open until January.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...Bypass sections to open on WednesdayTransport Scotland has announced that new sections of the delayed Aberdeen bypass will open on Wednesday morning.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...data-size\"x\"data-unitname\"  inverurie.jp native\"data-label\"Section\"data-categories\"\" data-status\"enabled\"data-dfpId\"\" data-overlay\"\"data-dfpSiteCode\"inverurie.jp\"data-isResponsiveSite\"true\"Aberdeen bypass: No date yet for openingNorth-East MSPs have met Transport Secretary Michael Matheson to emphasise the urgency of work to ensure the Aberdeen bypass is opened as soon as possible.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...A options to go on displayA series of public exhibitions will be held next month for residents to view a number of initial options that have been developed for the A.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...Proposals for AWPR bus service announcedStagecoach is inviting customers across Aberdeenshire to provide feedback on new bus timetable proposals planned to come into force in November.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...AWPR lsquodelayrsquo under fireThe Scottish Government has been accused of #losing all control# of the Aberdeen bypass project.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...Survey suggests transport links are poorA survey of Newmachar residents has shown that nearly two thirds believe the main A road is too congested, while a majority don#t feel public transport links are good enough.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...Community events to mark bypass openingA weekend of community events will be held to mark the opening of the Aberdeen bypass.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...Be vigilant as surface dressing gets underway across the ShireAberdeenshire Council#s summer programme of surface dressing works is now underway across the area and motorists are being warned of the risks of loose chips on newly dressed roads.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...Bus company launches contactless paymentsStagecoach has introduced contactless payments on their buses.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...Bypass work continues despite liquidationWork on the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Routewill continue despite this week#s announcement that construction giant Carillion has gone into liquidation.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...BEAR Scotland preparing for Storm CarolineBEAR Scotland#s resources are prepared to assist in dealing with the #Storm Caroline# conditions with winds of up to mph forecast.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...Have your say on bus proposalsStagecoach is inviting customers across the area to provide feedback on new bus timetable proposals to commence from January .Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...A average speed cameras set to go liveThe A Average Speed Camerasystem between Dundee and Stonehaven will go live on Tuesday, October .Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...Resurfacing work to begin on roundaboutsResurfacing work on the A Blackhall and Inverurie roundabouts will begin this Sunday for six nights.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...Road to close this weekend for AWPR workThe CC Chapel of Stoneywood to Fairly Road is expected to close at its junction with the UC Tulloch Road this weekend.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...More action needed on air pollutionEnvironmental groups and The Scottish Greens have called on the UK Government to do more to tackle air pollution.Traffic and Travel   wrapper  ,  wrapper...

These would be in place for up to three years, although it is unlikely that they would be required for thisof time.The equipment used on the met masts gathers a range of meteorological data in order to provide a detailed understanding of the area’s wind characteristics.Orkney Islands Council announced in April that is was intending to investigate an additional two sites for potential community wind farms in the county — to add to the project already under investigation on Hoy.The new sites under consideration are located at Faray, in the North Isles, and at Quanterness in St Ola. The aim of the project, which is being led by the OIC#s strategic projects team, would be to generate signicant income and community benefit for Orkney.Sweyn Johnston, the council’s strategic projects director, said: “Applying for planning permission for the #met masts# is the latest stage in further investigating the sites we have identied and have been discussing with folk at drop-in events over the last few months.

Now, the environmental body hopes that this will be reduced by Scotland’s forthcoming depositscheme.Under the scheme, shoppers will pay a p deposit when buying drinks purchased in single-use plastic or glass bottles and aluminium or steel cans. People will get their money back when theytheir empty container for recycling. The aim of that p will be to give people an extra incentive to recycle their empty bottles and cans, and make people think twice about dropping them.#Our new figures reveal how Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme could visibly slash the number of littered plastic bottles in the Orkney Islands,# said Zero Waste Scotland#s chief operating officer, Jill Farrell.#We all hate seeing empty bottles and cans littering our streets, green spaces and beaches. The great thing about Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme is it will give people a p incentive to do the right thing with their empty bottles — take them back for recycling, rather than risk them ending up on our streets or in our rivers.#Litter isn’t just an eyesore — it also pollutes our environment and seas. And for every bottle littered, more plastic has to be created, generating more planet-damaging emissions. When you take back your empty bottles to be recycled, you’ll not just be getting your p back — you’ll be doing your bit in the fight against the climate emergency.#Further figures from Zero Waste Scotland also show that Orkney goes through an estimated . million plastic bottles every year. An estimated , plastic bottles are littered in the county each year. With a p incentive not to throw away your empties, Zero Waste Scotland anticipates a  per cent reduction in litter for the materials included in the scheme. This would mean , fewer plastic bottles dropped in Orkney Islands each year.With plastic bottles only one of the materials included in the scheme, the overall impact on litter is expected to be even higher. Steel and aluminium cans, glass bottles will also be part of the scheme. The Scottish Government is expected to introduce legislation to enable the scheme later this year.

Orkney’s MSP highlighted the government’s continued failure to find a solution to the islands’ internal ferry services, including replacement vessels, and the lack of progress on implementing RET on external services, a year on from the promised start date. Mr McArthur said: “The National Islands Plan will be important in mapping out the areas where improvements are needed to secure a vibrant future for our island communities.“During the passage of the legislation, I moved amendments making clear that one of the most urgent priorities would be delivering changes and improvements to leline ferry services to meet the needs of people and businesses in Orkney.“This seems to be the message that is coming through loud and clear in the consultation, as demonstrated by the recent response from the NFUS.  It will come as a surprise to no one but should act as a clear signal to ministers that the continued failure to act is unacceptable.“We need a sustainable and long term solution to the funding and operation of our internal ferry services, on which some of our most fragile communities rely. This includes replacement vessels for a fleet that is ageing and no longer fit for purpose.“In addition, more than a year on from the date on which RET was supposed to be introduced, we seem no nearer seeing the reduction in fares. Those using these services are therefore continuing to pay over the odds.

Internal features such as stone benches have also been found along either side.The hall is oriented towards the sea and finds include steatite , pottery, a bone spindle whorl and a fragment of a Norse bone comb.The find provides tantalising evidence of the earliest phases of inhabitation on this farm and settlement mound which may well have been inhabitated for over , years.It provides another piece to the ,-year jigsaw along this archaelogy rich stretch of coast as Westness in Rousay — described as the #Egypt of the North#.A team of archaeologists from the University of the Highlands and Islands Archaeology Institute, Rousay residents and students have been digging at the site for a number of years, investigating the later stages of the farm complex and its waste heaps with a particular focus on past diet, farming and fishing practices.Although only partly uncovered at this stage, the Skaill hall has parallels with other Norse halls excavated in Orkney, such as Snusgar, and where in Scotland.The excavation is part of the Landscapes of Change — Archaeologies of the Rousay Clearances and Westness Estate project which is exploring the Skaill farmstead.The present farm at Skaill dates to the th and th centuries and was part of the Rousay clearances during the mid-th century.The name Skaill suggests the site was home to a Norse hall or drinking hall, and was a high status site.Westness is mentioned in Orkneyinga saga as the home of Sigurd, a powerful chieftain, so it was always likely that a Norse settlement was located somewhere at Skaill.Earlier structures have been found below the present farm during previous seasons, and this season explored more of the Norse phases of the site.Three dimensional models of the farmstead can be found here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He added that he was open to talks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he believed there had been some suggestion the Withdrawal Agreement was an ldquoinvention of the Dublin government or had been imposed by the European Union.ldquoThatrsquos not the case, he said. ldquoTherersquos an attempt to make out that itrsquos undemocratic too but itrsquos been agreed by  governments, including the UK Government, and the European Parliament, all of which followed democratic procedures.Earlier, Mr Donohoe said while a deal was ldquostill possible, the prospect of no deal had increased.He was in London as he met Chancellor Sajid Javid to discuss the UK Governmentrsquos latest plans for exiting the EU.Speaking to the BBCrsquos Newsnight programme, he said a deal could be done.He added: ldquoI believe it is still possible that we could see agreements in which Britain enters into a transition agreement in advance of them finally departing before the European Union.ldquoBut as I stand now, Irsquod have to be equally clear in saying that I do believe that the prospect of a no-deal Brexit has grown.ldquoI believe that a no-deal Brexit and the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without a deal is a very credible and material risk now. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Irish Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe met with Chancellor Sajid Javid--Mr Donohoe said the appointment of Mr Johnson as Prime Minister had ldquoadded a new dynamic to Brexit talks.ldquoI believe Prime Minister Johnson feels dferently about the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union and the future trust of that relationship to how Prime Minister May would have, he said.ldquoAnd I believe that has added a new dynamic into where we are in Brexit.ldquoBut in acknowledging that there is a new dynamic, I am also crystal clear that the views of the Irish government and the views of Ireland in relation to the backstop, the Withdrawal Agreement and our future in the European Union, which have been affirmed again and again, that would not be changing.Speaking to journalists at the Irish embassy after his meeting with Mr Javid, Mr Donohoe warned the relationship between the UK and Ireland would ldquofundamentally change in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Earlier in the day, Michael Gove accused the EU of refusing to engage in negotiations on a new Brexit deal. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who is in charge of no-deal preparations, said he was ldquodeeply saddened by the EU position, which was ldquonot in Europersquos interests.ldquoWe will put all our energy into making sure that we can secure that good deal but at the moment it is the EU that seems to be saying they are not interested, he said.ldquoThey are simply saying lsquoNo, we donrsquot want to talkrsquo. I think that is wrong and sad.On Tuesday evening, at a political discussion in Belfast, Mr Varadkar said calls by Sinn Fein for a border poll in the event of a no-deal Brexit were ldquoisive.He added: ldquoI think it would result in some of the mistakes made  years ago, when partition happened, being repeated but just the other way around ndash a huge number of people, those from a unionist, British, Ulster background, being brought into a united Ireland against their will.copy -.

The goodwill for such agreements was there, she added.It is easy to see the appeal of such agreements for those voters who believe that Brexit – especially the no-deal iety now envisaged by the Prime Minister – represents a catastrophic act of self-harm. If Swinson and the leaders of other avowedly anti-Brexit parties could reach agreements in key constituencies across the UK to stand only the candidate with the greatest chance of winning then, surely, the chances of the Johnson project being stopped in its tracks would be greatly enhanced.There are just one or two small hurdles in the way…The first of these is the fact that, although speculation runs feverishly, Johnson has not yet called a general election.It’s certainly true that many Conservative Party MPs would like the new PM to capitalise on a boost in the polls to try to increase their numbers at Westminster, but others believe this might be a risky strategy. If Nigel Farage’s Brexit Partysplits the right-wing Eurosceptic vote, then a snap election could bring the Johnson premiership to a sudden end.But let us imagine that Johnson goes down the general election route before the current Brexit deadline of  October and that Swinson sets about trying to build an anti-Brexit coalition. She might have been able to persuade Plaid and the Greens to step aside in a single by-election, but would these parties really be so keen to lay down their electoral chances across the country  Would they risk, by seeing their overall votes in a general election diminish severely, becoming less politically relevant And what about the SNP, every bit as opposed to Brexit as the Lib Dems  There are fewer seats in Scotland where anti-Brexit parties risk splitting the vote than there are in England, but one of them – East Dunbartonshire – is Swinson’s own.Swinson served as MP for that constituency between - and was then defeated by the SNP’s John Nicolson. She took the seat back in , largely, I suspect because of Nicolson’s unpopularity. But with a more impressive candidate, the SNP would surely have a fighting chance of snatching it back. The removal of the leader of the Liberal Democrats from the House of Commons would represent quite a scalp for the nationalists. Can you imagine Nicola Sturgeon passing up the opportunity to see off Swinson  I can’t. And nor would I blame the SNP leader for committing signicant resources to bringing down Swinson. Politics is a contact sport and Swinson is a major target. The suggestion from her that the SNP should give her a clear run at the seat would, rightly, be met with derision.Jo Swinson is not the only party leader now talking about pacts. Brexit Party leader Farage has raised the prospect of deals with the Conservatives, particularly in the north of England, to ensure the election of Eurosceptic MPs.Given the result of the  referendum, any such agreements would surely guarantee the evisceration of any anti-Brexit candidates in those areas.Yes, electoral pacts might be made to work for pro-EU parties but they could just as easily be the secret of Brexiteer success.Those now clamouring for agreements to be struck between the Lib Dems and other parties which take the same position on EU membership should, I think, be careful that they are not wishing for the creation of two-horse races in key constituencies across the country. That scenario would risk strengthening rather than weakening the Brexiteers’ squad at Westminster.Johnson is supported by a team in government that is fully committed to Brexit by  October at any cost. The PM will gladly sacrice the best interests of the UK economy to protect himself.This being so, and with Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour still embarrassingly weak on the matter of Brexit, the idea that the Johnson project might be stopped is an appealing one to those of us who would dearly like to see Brexit cancelled at this late stage.But I fear that any plan to run a single anti-Brexit candidate in a constituency would be met with a plan to run a single pro-Brexit candidate. Jiggery-pokery would be fought with jiggery-pokery.It is abundantly clear that Brexiteers won the  referendum with a campaign strewn with lies. Their promises of an effortless, painless departure from the EU have long since been exposed.But rather than turning against campaign leaders, pro-Brexit voters appear to be hardening their positions and cheering on a damaging no-deal departure.It may now be obvious that Brexit is going to be dficult to deliver. But stopping it will be harder still.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"golden handshakes for theresa may s ministers cost nearly 850k","story":"Ministers who quit, were sacked or lost their seats in the  general election during Theresa May#s premiership collected hundreds of thousands of pounds in payouts # including some MPs who have ed to government under Boris Johnson.The Prime Minister himself took home nearly £, when he resigned from the government in , and seven members of his Cabinet are also believed to have collected thousands of pounds in “golden goodbyes” over three years.According to analysis by the Politico website, more than £, was paid out in severance to MPs and peers serving in government.

Depending on theof their service, advisers are entitled to up to six months’ pay when they leave, but can also have money clawed backthey .A spokesperson for the Cabinet Office said: “Severance payments for ministers are set out in law and for special advisers are a contractual entitlement.“The special adviser contract sets out when they are payable, including when their minister leaves office and when there is a general election.

But there is always room for talks and negotiations,” he said.“We can certainly make changes to the Political Declaration and we have demonstrated before that it is possible to offer clarications.”Mr Varadkar insisted the Irish government was prepared for a no-deal Brexit, but added that he was “not fatalistic”.Concern in Brussels has risen sharply following a meeting last week between senior EU figures and Mr Johnson’s top EU adviser, David Frost.One official reportedly told diplomats from EU member states that the UK has no alternative to no-deal and “no intention to negotiate”.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re. So the estimated £ million that the HebCelt generates is more than welcome, as well as providing a brief respite from reality and a sense of something major happening on the doorstep. But just like the visit of old friends tends to be too brief, so there is already a longing for next July."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2465-Raasay.jpg","title":"recruitment drive to restore nursing cover for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe move, which is part of the recommendations outlined bySir Lewis Ritchie in his out of hour health care report for Skye, Lochalsh andSouth West Ross, intends to end a period of four years in which the island hasbeen without an overnight nursing presence.In its advert, NHS Highland states: “Professor Sir LewisRitchie#s Report of May  into out of hours care in Skye, Raasay and SouthWest Ross has enabled a move towards innovative healthcare here when he saw theneed for equity of access to services even where numbers are relatively small…“Raasay offers a rare opportunity to provide cradle to gravepersonal nursing and primary care with continuity while working as part of amutually supportive team.”The chosen applicants will have a “considerable degree ofautonomy” and would liaise with “colleagues and line manager based in NorthSkye and with access to support from GPs in Portree and Rural Practitioners inMacKinnon Memorial Hospital, Broadford when required.”The band six positions at a salary scale of £, # £, per annum are permanent with both full-time and part-time hours available."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LOCHCARRON-GAMES-1-adj.jpg","title":"number 41 in the sun for lochcarron highland","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.Sinclair Patience of Tain and Angus Davren of Conon Bridge excelled at the st edition of the games as they wrote their names into the record books.Angus Davren hit new heights as he cleared . metres to set a new ground record in the high jump.

The results are projects which genuinely improve the lives of today#s residents # as well as visitors # and leave a legacy for future generations. What is even more remarkable is the fact these projects are achieved with very little access to loans. The good work of the community trusts is achieved through dogged determination to raise funds within the community combined with seriously clever navigation of the minefield of grant applications. By steadily securing the funds from a myriad public pots and local activities the trusts ensure each project is not only affordable now, but sustainable for generations to come.In Staffin # home to the iconic Old Man of Storr # the local community trust has raised over £, to upgrade existing footpaths and create new ones. There will be new parking, #welcome# structures and interpretation boards at all sites. The whole project will result in what the trust is calling #Skye Ecomuseum# which will encourage visitors to spend more time and therefore more money in Staffin.In the north west of Skye, the Glendale Trust covers a huge area that attracts , visitors a year # many travelling the long and winding single track road to the top five hotspot of Neist Point.The trust, under the leadership of Tim Hunter-Davies and three new directors, is working hard to develop sustainable facilities for the community and tourists. They have taken ownership of Meanish Pier and the foreshore, creating opportunities for local residents and regional businesses alike. It will be run commercially and provide income to enable the Trust to invest in further sustainable community projects.Glendale # which was the subject of Scotland#s first community buyout back in  # is rich in history and the trust is also looking to develop projects that preserve and share the story of the area, as Tim Hunter-Davies explains: #As well as being instrumental in land reform in the last century, Glendale has a rich heritage stretching back through the centuries. A steamer used to sail daily from Loch Dunvegan and was used as a point to transport many people away from Scotland during the Highland clearances. We want to preserve and share our history with the community and visitors.#In south Skye is the Sleat Community Trust. It has been working hard to provide and improve leline services for the community that also benefit visitors arriving and leaving Skye on the Armadale Mallaig ferry.The SCT currently provides shop, post office and fuel services in two buildings no longer fit for purpose. Over £, has been raised from public and private sources to build a new shop with a community #social# space and offices for the employees of the Trust. They hope to open the new shop in early summer .In addition, the purchase by the Trust of the -hectare Tormore Forest in  continues to create additional sources of income, including selling housing plots as well as an attraction for the community and visitors alike. As trust business development manager Mike Shucksmith explains, the success is based on a combination of commercial and voluntary activity.He said: #To maintain the forest, we have to generate income so we sell split logs to the community, create woodchip for biomass boilers and are developing a micro-hydro scheme. At the same time, we have a vibrant volunteer culture in Sleat who have created a network of paths, social areas and a polytunnel where local school children can help grow saplings to regenerate the forest. The trust also operates #Skyenet # a community broadband network # a community transport scheme, Tormore Explore Forest School and the Visit Sleat tourism group, which promotes the area as a destination of choice for visitors.#From the Sleat Peninsula to the gateway to Skye in the south where a new access route to the island is being created by the members of the Broadford and Strath Community Company. They are developing a cycle path all the way from Kyle of Lochalsh to Broadford. One of the project pioneers is keen local cyclist, Andy Neison.#I used to commute from Teangue on Sleat to Kyle by bike,# he said. #I was really unnerved by the road from Breakish to Kyle with a high volume of fast-moving traffic. When friends told me about the old road from Broadford to Kyle I started exploring sections of it. It#s a good starting point and will become a pioneer project for the highlands.#After receiving a grant of £, from Sustrans, a sustainable transport charity, to fund engineering and traffic surveys, the Trust is now working to secure funding for a project officer to take the Skye Cycleway to the next phase. The community is heavily invested in the project with volunteers coming out in all weathers to clear sections of the old road, but this is a long-term project with hundreds of thousands of pounds ultimately needed to complete the full route from Kyle to Broadford.Over the Skye bridge, the Kyle and Lochalsh Community Trust is creating a vast community and visitor experience on a piece of land known as the Plock.Securing funding from the Scottish Land Fund enabled the Trust to take ownership of the Plock and the old Skye Bridge toll office and develop a masterplan for these two community assets. On the Plock itself, there will be a hub building with cafe, carpark and toilets, a network of accessible paths, a #pitch and putt# course, a Viking living village, accommodation pods, a watersports centre, wildle hide and a for thrill-seekers a huge zipline across the bay.Jo Wawrzyczek of the trust expects the Plock to attract , visitors a year. #This is an ambitious project that will cost almost £million,# she said. #However, it is very important for local people and businesses as it will help to create a great community space as well as keep visitors in our community for longer.#The trust also owns and manages the public toilets and pontoons in Kyle which will be a source of income for the project. With the aim of making the project self-sustaining, the Trust plans to lease the café and watersports centre on the Plock as well as generating income through the accommodation pods. Inspired by the success of other community-driven harbour developments such as Tobermory on Mull, Portree and Braes Community Trust want to maximise opportunities for local people and visitors through taking ownership of the harbour and improving facilities.The trust is currently in talks about relocating the oil tanks at the pier head which would be a breakthrough for the project and open up commercial opportunities. They are also considering a new road from the south to improve access and ert traffic away from the town centre. But according to development officer Fiona Thompson a new breakwater and pontoons will be the real game-changer for Portree.She said: #There have been aspirations for improvements to facilities at the harbour for over  years with little major investment.The harbour group are now closer than ever to realizing the community#s vision for a new, vibrant, welcoming port. A breakwater will allow us to provide overnight berths and efficient, comfortable transfer for cruise ship passengers, while a visitor centre will provide a warm highland welcome to visitors from across the globe. This project will be transformational for Portree and surrounding areas.#The community trusts of Skye and Lochalsh all have several features in common. They have vision, ambition, energy and drive and they are full of volunteers who are committed to bringing long-term projects to fruition for the benefit of their community # and their visitors # for decades to come."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Skye-Bridge-2018-winners.jpg","title":"skye bridge 10k race to kick start kyleakin gala","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe first bridge k was held  years ago, and since  hundreds have taken on the challenge in an event which has helped raise thousands of pounds for good causes based in Kyleakin and surrounding areas.back again.Online entry — which is discounted — will be open until Friday th August, or runners can register on the morning of the race for £.

It’s really invaluable having Deirdre and Micheál onboard and it was incredible to see so much of an eclectic mix of people at the launch. Art and creativity is very much part of the foundation of Féile.”Aisling Award winner Deirdre Mackel has spent six years at the helm of the visual arts exhibition having previously become involved as an exhibitor. “I have seen the exhibition grow over the years, it’s brilliant to be a part of, to see the amount of people coming in and just taking their time to see the art works,” she said. “It just really warms my heart to see all the art up in St Mary’s.”Deirdre spoke of the amount of preparation that goes into the artistic showcase each year. “There is a lot of background work, the call that goes out for artists to display in the first instance. When you see people coming in and installing their art works it’s just magical. You really get a sense of what it means on launch night which we had last Wednesday, seeing what it means to people, to the artist it lts my spirits. Debuting artists would say ‘I’m so nervous’ and they come back year after year, the exhibition really encourages new artist development and another thing that comes out of it is a real sense of volunteering.”Deirdre continued: “Local artist Micheál Gallagher has also come on board and the team have been very much hands on deck. We have some really stand-out pieces from the West Belfast Arts Society, Richard Kelly and a focal point is always the Relatives for Justice Remembrance Quilt. We have a series of Civil Rights posters which were exhibited in the Tate Modern and now they have been brought to Féile.“We are seeing a lot of the artists coming here with their families and staying for the duration of the festival. The visual arts exhibit gains more and more momentum year on year.” The Féile Visual Arts Exhibition will be on display until Thursday, August . All are welcome to attend."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"bombay street play brings back memories for roma","story":"BRASSNECK Theatre Company’s latest productiontells the story of the burning of Bombay Street.Something in the Air will take to the stage at the Roddy’s for a limited run during the annual Féile an Phobail. Written by playwright Laurence McKeown and centred on events surrounding the pogroms, which led to the outbreak of the Troubles  years ago this August, the play details how sectarian violence erupted across the city, how families were forced to flee their homes and ended up taking refuge across the border. Brassneck Artistic Director Tony Devlin told the Andersonstown News how the play will coincide with the th anniversary of the events, which were the catalyst for the Troubles. “This play is a daring piece of writing that will force audiences to not only reflect on the  years since the Troubles began but through it we want to create a conversation for debate and discussion about how we collectively move forward for the benefit of future generations.“The play explores one woman’s journey from Bombay Street after that night when her family were forced from their home and forced to go to a place called Gormanston down south where these families stayed for a few months while Bombay Street was rebuilt or they were rehoused,” he said. “ years later, this woman, who was  at the time, is expecting a researcher from Dublin to come and talk to her about the events of that night. This character Rosie Murray is played by acclaimed actor Roma Tomelty who I have known for years and am delighted to be working with in this project.”Tony spoke of how the play was to be first performed at The MAC theatre back in May but had to be halted due to the tragic death of fellow lead actress Mary Jordan’s mother in a car accident in Dublin. “We cancelled the show and now are in a position to bring it back. Working on this, directing this has been an education for me having been born in the late ’s, I had never heard of Gormanston. I didn’t know we had refugees in our own country during this time in our history. “Myself and Laurence also wanted to focus on the North South ide which is an underlying theme in this play. We wanted to address how the North and South has been pulled apart since partition.”Roma Tomelty who portrays the character of Rosie Murray said she knew “exactly who she, Rosie, was” from the first few lines of the script. “I have known Tony a long time, he asked me to play the part and we have a long history. When I got the script, the first line is that ‘I went to St Vincent’s School’ – which I did so from then on in I thought I know exactly who you are. The play is marking this event. “I was on the road the night the burning of Bombay Street happened. We were trying to get home to Andersonstown, my aunt was burnt out of Dover Street. “There is a line in the play about ‘ordinary people living in extraordinary times’. I remember driving through the chaos that night, you just got on with it,” she said. Actor Mary Jordan’s character is now a researcher after “turning her back” on her former banking career during the Celtic Tiger. “My character becomes very interested in Rosie’s story and to learn that there were refugees from Belfast. She comes to visit Rosie to hear more and I can’t say anymore than that,” she added cryptically. “Audiences will find out more as the play progresses.”Something in the Air will run at the Roddy McCorley Social Club from Wednesday August  until Sunday August .Tickets are priced at £ and are available from the bar."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38379532.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/_108213527_watertower2.jpg","title":"flags removed from rathfriland water tower","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The unusual detail of the thatched house with its steep roof, eaves gutter and tall chimney is unique in Northern Ireland, according to the Department for Communities.This means the house appears to the passer-by as two dwellings, each with a front door, but it is in fact a single dwelling which for most of the past century has been home to the Maccombe family.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetMurray Maccombeis the third generation of his family to live in the magnicent dwelling, which sits on a three-acre site.Speaking to the Belfast , Mr Maccombe said he has fond memories of the house going back to his early years.He said: \"My grandfather Robert Henry Maccombe bought this house around  and it has been in our family since, but the original owner was a man called Hugh McCullagh.\"At the time my grandfather bought it, it was a farmhouse but also a grocers shop hardware store and it stayed like that until  when he opened a shop separate from the house.\"I have very clear memories of visiting my grandparents and obviously living there when my father Alan took it over.\"My father passed away in  but my mother stayed on, on her own.\"I moved in with my own family in  and I will be sad to leave the house, but really it has outgrown my we and I. \"Our two daughters are away at university and the reality it the house is too large for us to upkeep, especially the gardens, but it will be a great buy for someone.\"The house is being sold for Mr Maccombe by Donnybrook Estate Agents in Derry for offers over £,.Stephen McCarron said he expects that the house will attract a lot of interest.He said: \"We are delighted to have this magnicent property on our books for sale and there has been interest shown already from people in the UK and further afield. \"It is a property steeped in history but also comes with so much potential for development and I am optimistic it will have a new owner before long.\"Further details and an appointment to view can be arranged through Donnybrook Estate Agents on   "},{"url":null,"title":"restore stormont to give northern ireland voice at brexit table urges varadkar","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

include provision for a border poll at a certain point in time, under certain circumstances, and that is what the principle of consent in the Good Friday Agreement is all about – that Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom because the people of Northern Ireland want it to be, but the people of Northern Ireland have a choice to change that by referendum should they choose to in the

It is perched above the Co Donegal village of Burt and attracts thousands of visitors every year.The fort is a powerful manestation of what remains of ancient Ireland and on a clear day, from its pinnacle, it is possible to get a glimpse of three counties-Donegal, Derry and Tyrone. The commanding and spectacular waterways of Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle lie to its west and east respectively.But, in the th Century the fort, once home to kings of old Gaelic order, was rapidly disintegrating towards extinction. It was however saved by the vision of one man who spearheaded its restoration just over  years ago.Dr Walter Bernard was born on May ,  at Newmarket, Co Cork. His father was a captain in the th Rles, a regiment of the British Army and was amongst the reinforcements that arrived in Brussels on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo in June of  but was apparently too late to take part in the famed history changing conflict.Walter became a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons of Great Britain and Ireland in , a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland in  and Fellow of that college in .Between - Dr Bernard served as a surgeon throughout the Crimean War attending the wounded British soldiers at Inkerman and witnessed the ravages caused by small pox and cholera. He later recalled that for every man that was shot, fty more were killed by those diseases, particularly in the notoriously harsh winters of  and .On the journey home from the Ukranian battlefields, he saved a man from drowning and was awarded with a certicate from the Royal Humane Society. Then, with his experiences of military conflict at an end, Dr Bernard landed back in Ireland and settled in Buncrana before building up a very large medical practice in Derry. He ran this surgery for over sixty years and was a prominent member of the city’s branch of the British Medical Association as well as holding many public offices throughout his career.One such appointment was to examine the quality of water in the city for Londonderry Corporation at public facilities such as the Creggan reservoirs built in stages between -, and which supplied much of the city’s domestic and industrial water needs.His experience of the waterborne disease cholera in the Crimea made him an ideal candidate for this job.Dr Bernard also addressed the Medical Society of King and Queens College of Physicians on the issuer of diphtheria in April . He cautioned the assembled medics that there was a reason why the disease was largely absent from statistics sheets.He said: “There are few diseases about which so many mistakes in diagnosis are made.”He feared the misdiagnosis rate was so high that it was almost impossible to ensure that ‘true diphtheria’ was as common in a town as reported.Dr Bernard added: “Diphtheria occurs in Londonderry, I have no doubt whatever…in my practice it has been my lot to treat many cases of this disease.”At some point in , Dr Bernard paid a visit to Grianan of Aileach and many years later in , he said of the experience: “Seventeen years ago, when this traditional and historical place was first visited by me, I found it in a very ruinous condition, and from that time I commenced to take an interest in its associations.“Year after year I witnessed further advance of its ruin, and I clearly saw thatsomething were not soon done to arrest the progress of its destruction, it would be in a few years a thing of the past.”Grianan of Aileach is a hilltop fort that sits on top of Greenan Mountain in Inishowen just over  feet above ground level.The ringfort was thought to have been built in the sixth or seventh century, although there is some evidence to suggest that the site had been in use before that.Greek astronomer and cartographer Ptolemy penned a remarkably accurate map of Ireland in  A.D. from which maps were later created in the th and th centuries. He called the land ‘Iouernia’, thought to mean ‘abundant land’ from which the Irish names Eriu and Eire are derived. Amongst two sites identied as ‘regia’ or royal places in Ireland by the Greek map maker, one of them is believed by some historians to be the Grianan of Aileach.Whether Ptolemy pinpointed it or not, the Kingdom of Aileach was indeed one of Ireland’s royal sites of the Gaelic order. The fort was thought to have been constructed originally by the northern section of the Ui Neill clan, but between  A.D. and the thirteen centuries, over  kings from ious clans, some also High Kings of Ireland, held the throne of Aileach. The last man to be known as the King of Aileach was Aed Buide Ua Neill who died in .Despite ious interpretations, it is generally agreed that Aileach means ‘stony place’ and the word Grianan means ‘sunny place’ so that Grianan of Aileach broadly translates as ‘The Stone Palace of the Sunny View’.Whatever the actual meaning of its name, it is evident that it was an extremely important place. Aileach’s political and strategic importance was such that the annals of Irish history record that it was attacked at least three times. In , Finsnechta Fledach, King of Ireland, destroyed the fort.Again, in , when Muirchertach MacNeill was king, Viking raiders sacked the site when they settled at Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle. It’s also thought that King Brian Boru came to Aileach in , but it was destroyed once more in , when another King of Munster, Muirchertach Ua Briaincame to Inishowen and plundered the region and razed the fort. The fort was laid to waste by O’Brien in revenge for O’Neill’s destruction of his royal seat at Kincora and he reportedly told his soldiers to each take a stone from the Donegal hillside so the place would be reduced to rubble.The fort itself could have served two main s both as a defensive and a ceremonial one and moreover as a settlement that was surrounded by ringforts of lesser importance. Whatever its actual , it is known that buildings of this nature were very rare in North West Ulster and its presence signies that its inhabitants were regarded as being very important.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThe linking of St Patrick to the site is seen as attempt by Christian converts to place it firmly in that tradition whilst acknowledging its pagan history and the naming of a holy well right outside the ringfort in honour of Ireland’s patron saint seems to confirm that.There is also a mythological and folklore version of the founding of Grianan of Aileach which says the ringfort was built by Dagda , a god and the king of the Tuatha De Danann-the supposed ‘Tribe of the Gods’-a supernatural race in Irish mythology. The Tuatha De Danann are said to have invaded Ireland before the Celts and built strategic stone forts on the tops of hills.Dagda was said to have fought the Second Battle of Moytirra against the Fomorians and the fort at Aileach was built over the grave of his son Aedh who had been murdered.In , a Derry based group called the Irish Irelanders, enthusiastic Gaelic revivalists travelled to the site on Sunday afternoons and carried out some repairs. But, the splendour and historical intrigue of Grianan of Aileach had largely been ignored for many years until in , Dr Walter Bernard decided to begin its restoration in earnest.In the s, painter, musician, antiquarian and archaeologist George Petrie examined Grianan of Aileach when he was head of the Royal Irish Academy’s antiquities committee which was linked to the Irish Ordnance Survey.Petrie’s findings suggested that the hill many have been enclosed by many other ramparts and a line of stones leading up to the entrance which were all gone by then.But, despite his efforts, the expert’s findings remained confined to the records of the Royal Irish Academy, there were no efforts by the organisation to attempt any restoration of the ancient site.It was Dr Bernard who took practical action beyond the analysis of the site. He paid for the entire project that took place between - and recruited his crew of labourers from the farms surrounding Burt. They ferried the materials needed for the restoration on the back up small carts up supplied by the local landowners up the incredibly steep hill.What the doctor found at the site was a disorganised mess of which he said it was: “An immense circular heap of stones, with its grey fallen masonry scattered over the interior-no vestige of a wall, entrance passage, or central building.”Remembering that Walter Bernard was a medical doctor with no detailed description of what an ancient ringfort truly looked like and that there weren’t enough stones on site to complete the job, makes this story even more remarkable.Dr Bernard discovered many animal bones on the site including sheep, cows and goats and items like sling stones and warrior’s clubs. The most interesting stone object discovered was a ‘slab of sandstone, chequered into thirty-six squares’, believed to be a games board of some type.The doctor and his crew of labourers used the measurements of other Irish forts such as Staigue Fort in Co Kerry as the comparative basis for the restoration project at Grianan of Aileach. The finished product is a fort that stands . metres in diameter and more than five metres tall with walls that are almost four metres thick.Dr Bernard later described a part of the building project by saying: “To bind our work into a complete unity we had to gather around the hill about  or  loose stones-certainly not more,so many-and to split from the adjoining rocks, cropping up through the heather,  coping stones. These are supposed to serve instead of those removed by King Murdock O’Brien in .”Only speculation can be used to assessthe interior of today’s fort accurately resembles its ancient predecessor, but when the alternative was the complete disappearance of the Iron Age construction, then surely Bernard’s efforts become even more admirable.The fort has stood for centuries as a silent witness to major events of Irish history. From the top of Grianan fort you can just make out the location of the Co Donegal village of Rathmullen on the western bank of Lough Swilly.It was from Rathmullen in  that the chieftains Hugh O’Neill and Rory O’Donnell sailed with their families after the final defeat by the English taking with them the last symbols of the old Gaelic order once enshrined in its pomp by places such as Grianan of Aileach. Behind them in the distance the old fort sat on its hilltop as a fading reminder of a society and its traditions that would never .A legend says that in a secret cave on a hill beneath Grianan O’Neill’s warriors rest in a bewitched sleep in full armour and sitting on their horses ready for the next fight. The spell, says the legend, will only be broken when the next destined leader of Ulster arrives to lead them to victory.It is a myth that would have no visible attachmentit had not been for the passion of Dr Walter Bernard in the late th century in restoring Grianan of Aileach to something approaching its former glory.A tourist road to the fort was opened on September ,  by President of Ireland Eamon De Valera who was accompanied by Fine Gael TD for Donegal West, Pat O’Donnell, then Minister for Local Government. In the early s the Office of Public Works in the Republic of Ireland carried out further repairs to Grianan of Aileacgh after a wall collapsed. But as late as October  the Irish Government was being severely criticised by political representatives in Donegal for still failing to establish tour guides and other facilities at the ancient site.In his obituary contained in the Universities and Colleges magazine of December , , it was reported that Dr Bernard died suddenly at his residence in Buncrana on eight days previously on December . He was -years-old and was buried in Derry City Cemetery.Dr Bernard’s obituary ended: “He leaves a widow. His le was deeply scarred by three great sorrows, the deaths of his three children.”CAPTION: The volunteers involved in the restoration of Grianan of Aileach pictured at its official re-opening in ."},{"url":null,"title":"national hunger strike commemoration take place strabane sunday","story":"This Sunday, August , for the first time the National Hunger Strike Commemoration will be held for the first time in Strabane.Thirty-eight years after ten republicans died in Long Kesh during the spring and summer of , thousands of people from across Ireland will march from Lford across the border to the west Tyrone town to remember the prison battle conducted against the Thatcher administration’s policy of criminalisation.Speaking at the announcement that Strabane will host the event, Sinn Fein’s West Tyrone MP Orfhlaith Begley said it was a privilege for Strabane republicans and the rest of the constituency to host the event.“The  hunger strike was a watershed in Irish history and had a profound impact in terms of radicalising communities throughout Ireland. This impact was particularly felt in areas like here in Strabane where pride in the hunger strikers, their courage and sacrice still remains undiminished almost  years on.”The roots of what took place in  began several years earlier, when in  Belfast republican Kieran Nugent became the first man to refuse to wear a prison unorm. In , republicans had been accorded what the British termed Special Category Status recognising the political nature of their offences.By the mid-s however, political status had been withdrawn and as the cages of Long Kesh were replaced by the concrete H Blocks, the new British policy of ‘normalisation’ was wholly designed to strike any notion of political credence away from the IRA campaign.When he entered the H Blocks, Kieran Nugent was instructed to put a prison unorm on by the authorities. He answered, ‘you’ll have to nail it to my back.’ This began five years of protest inside the prison and heightened violence outside it which resulted in dozens of deaths.The blanket and no wash protests of the first four years of the prison conflict yielded no concessions on the issue of political status.The years of isolation and living in dire conditions eventually brought the situation to a head. The choice was plain and stark. The protesting republican prisoners could either concede and serve out jail sentences classed as ‘ordinary criminals’ or escalate the protest to the last ‘weapon’ available to them inside a prison-the hunger strike.It was not a new tactic for the republican movement, and it drew its inspiration from stories from the old Gaelic order.It’s recorded in the annals of Irish history that when a citizen felt slighted by the ruling order, it was not uncommon for them to lie outside their dwelling and refuse food in the hope of publicly shaming the guilty party into reparation and or an apology.In , Thomas Ashe died in Mountjoy prison in Dublin after being force fed whilst on hunger strike demanding political status. Then, in , the Lord Mayor of Cork Terence McSwiney died after  days whilst on hunger strike in Brixton jail. And, next year in  to mark the centenary of the death of McSwiney, the National Hunger Strike Commemoration will take place in Cork city.Back in , Michael Gaughan died in Parkhurst on the Isle of Wight after  days on hunger strike, and shortly before the beginning of the prison blanket and no wash protests in Long Kesh, in February , another Mayo man, Frank Stagg died at Wakefield jail in Yorkshire after  days without food.The first Long Kesh hunger strike began on October , . The protestors set out a list of five demands: -The right not to wear a prison unorm -The right not to do prison work -The right of free association with other prisoners -The right to organise their own educational and recreational facilities and -The right to one visit, one letter and one parcel a week.Seven men, including Sinn Fein MLA Raymond McCartney said they would fast to the death in the pursuit of the re-establishment of political status. Simultaneously, three female republican prisoners also embarked on a strike in Armagh jail.As Christmas  approached, the British offered a deal which appeared to agree to the central demand of the right not to wear a prison unorm. One of the hunger strikers, Sean McKenna was close to death at this stage and the strike was called off. It later emerged that was really being offered was a deal to allow prisoners to wear ‘civilian type clothing’ supplied by the prison regime. The scene was therefore already set for a second strike.It began on March ,  when Bobby Sands refused to eat. Raymond McCartney said: “Obviously everybody’s memory of  is the fact that ten people died on hunger strike.“On March ,  the British Government removed political status. I think most people thought that this was a half-hearted attempt and they’d roll over within a short period of time.“But, clearly what was emerging was a complete change in policy by the British Government who were intent on the idea of ‘normalisation’, ‘criminalisation’ and ‘Ulsterisation’.“Instinctively, any of us who found ourselves in prison at that time, knew we were political prisoners and any attempt to criminalise us just wasn’t going to work. It became a battle of wills.“But, I think by the end of the hunger strike in October, , most people looking on were saying that whatever was going on in the North that nobody in their wildest notion thought it was a criminal conspiracy. They certainly saw it as a political conflict. They may not have agreed with the armed actions of the IRA, but they certainly viewed it as a political situation.“So, for us by that stage, the process of criminalisation was in tatters. But, there was a very high price paid because  people had died in prison and  or  people had died on the streets.“Within the prisons we knew that we still had work to do because what we had to do was turn that acceptance of political imprisonment into every day conditions. By the end of the hunger strike I suppose there was a big recognition of the dference between the criminal’s unorm and our own clothes was one manestation of it. And, over the years we continued to ensure the conditions in Long Kesh reflected that.“By the late s and early s, journalists were frequent visitors to the prison and left with the overwhelming impression that we were a ‘dferent type’ of prisoner. They may have gone out and had questions about who you were and what you were about but they were in doubt that we were political prisoners. That was a big source of validation.”The intensity of the events and scale of death and destruction between  and  in retrospect now seems enormous, but Raymond McCartney maintains that it paved the way for future political developments.“It was only five years, but it was a very intense five years. It is only when you get a bit older you realise just how short a time span it was, because when you roll onto  and the Good Friday Agreement there was an acceptance of the framework that there was a political conflict which had to be resolved by political means-the recognition of political mandates, the political framework to address all these issues, but at the core of that was the acceptance of political prisoners.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“There is no doubt there is evidence that there were elements within the British Government were determined that political status should not be granted for whatever reason.“Even in , when there was internment without trial and up to , people were held in conditions where they wore their own clothes. There was a recognition of the political conflict of one nature or another.“How that was defined by dferent people is a dferent matter. I know that other people have made the observation that for too long the British tried to deal with the North as a security issue. therefore, when you have a security mentality or emergency laws, emergency courts, emergency interrogation centres, everything is changed and turned upside down.“If you follow their logic from that point of view and they say ‘you cannot now say you are political prisoners’ whilst trying to pretend that everything  about the situation isn’t political too then the penny drops in a whole lot of ways.”The almost  years since  have provoked much debate within wider nationalism about whether or not the hunger strike was harnessed as a catalyst for the republican movement to embark on the path to politics.The election of Bobby Sands to Westminster and Kieran Doherty to the Dail was followed quickly by a debate within Sinn Fein about ending their policy of abstentionism from political institutions that would lead to a split in the republican movement in . The Derry News asked Raymond McCartney for his view on this.He said: “It is interesting now, because everyone has their story about what the origins of the peace process was. But, there is absolutely no doubt that when you look back as far as  that Gerry Adams that there needed to be a political way of resolving the conflict, because military stalemate was exactly that.“The famous Glover Report from the British Army accepted that there was not going to be a military defeat, was them in their own way, saying the IRA was a political force and that the guys in Long Kesh were political prisoners. They job they were sent to do, they couldn’t do and that was to impose a military defeat and by extension their laws of oppression were not going to work either.“It made the situation painful and made the conflict last longer. Then, whenever the formula for the Good Friday Agreement was put forward, some former prisoners will tell you that it was too high a price to pay, but the core accepted it was a political problem and without political solutions it was never going to be resolved.”When the first hunger strike ended in October of , Raymond McCartney had gone without food for  days. So, what are his own personal recollections of the physical effects of what took place “I suppose when you look at that time in , Martin Hurson died after  days whilst others like Kevin Lynch were approaching  days when he died.“In a very strange way hunger strike affects dferent people in dferent ways. Even the day the hunger strike ended in , I was still walking about, I was out of bed. But, there is no doubt that your body slows down.“My ability to see was greatly affected. But, the body is a remarkable piece of equipment and resilience is obviously built in. As you get older you reflect on it and it is dficult to work out in your head that you could sustain doing without food for  days and others for  days.“I suppose when you look at that time in , Martin Hurson died after  days whilst others like Kevin Lynch were approaching  days when he died.

My ability to see was greatly affected.“As you get older you reflect on it and it is dficult to work out in your head that you could sustain doing without food for  days and others for  days.”Undoubtedly, it was Margaret Thatcher more than anyone  within the British establishment at the time who demonstrated complete determination to use the protests in Long Kesh to ide and break the republican movement.Many commentators have pointed to the INLA assassination of her colleague Airey Neave in  as one reason why the British Prime Minister embarked on a path of total intransigence towards the IRA. However, Raymond McCartney believes that her thinking was a lot wider than that.“Whatever her antipathy towards Ireland was and what came with that, she was setting out a broader political stall. Look at how she treated the miner’s later on.“Reading state papers now, years after these events, her take on the miner’s strike wasn’t just a battle about conditions in the mines, it was about strategically tackling trade unions. It was a case of her saying who is the strongest union-who is the spine of the working class and acting on that.“I always remember that being in jail gives you the time to reflect and read and think and I also always remember that Bobby Sands out of all the people who had been in jail was very clear about what he was there for because he wrote it all down. Some of the things he wrote captures the way a writer works-it’s all encompassing and puts it out there in a very vivid way.“I had previously been interned, I had an understanding about what being a political prisoner was. You had your own clothes and a bit of freedom to associate with other prisoners and you didn’t feel that sense of captivity although you were locked up. Bobby Sands caught on very early that the British were trying to defeat us in the prisons. It wasn’t just about trying to give you a hard time or denying you your own clothes, it was that they had a core idea to break us.“One of the rewarding things for me personally was that the system we had in the end in jail was one based on equality. That we treated people as equals. If you couldn’t treat the person beside you as a comrade and an equal that you couldn’t expect anyone  to believe that you’d treat all people as equals as you went on through le.”Those wishing to attend the th National Hunger Strike Commemoration are asked to assemble on Sunday, August  at .pm at the Diamond in Lford before marching across the border into Strabane where Martina Anderson MEP will deliver this year’s main oration.CAPTION: Raymond McCartney spent  days on hunger strike in ."},{"url":null,"title":"trade union blasts delusional derry employers treatment frontline workers","story":"A public sector trade union has blasted “unscrupulous” local employers for their “arrogant” mistreatment of workers.UNISON activists attended the recent NIHE Public consultation standardised regional payment rates event in the City Hotel to provide a voice for frontline workers employed through the Supporting People Programme.Earlier this year Derry City  Strabane District Council unanimously backed a motion in support of workers’ rights.The Supporting People programme, which has been operating since , provides housing support services delivered in partnership with service providers across the public, private and voluntary sectors.Support is provided to more than , vulnerable people every year, to enable them to live independently in their own homes, sheltered housing or in supported housing accommodation.Client groups include, Women’s Aid, the House in the Wells, Cheshire House, the Shepherds View Young Parents Project, Francis Street Young Persons Project, Apex Housing - Beechway House and the Simon Community.Its broad objectives are to achieve a better quality of le for vulnerable people, allowing them to live independently and maintain their tenancies. To provide housing support services to prevent problems that can often lead to hospitalisation, institutional care or homelessness.And finally, to assist with a smooth transition to those leaving an institutional environment to independent living.Following a review of the Supporting People programme by the Department for Communities in , it was recommended that payment rates across all Supporting People providers should be standardised.The new rates are supposed to ensure all schemes represent value for money.However, UNISON Community Branch members have questioned the commitment of certain employers within the sector.Niall McCarroll, UNISON Community Branch Chairperson said: “The Supporting People Programme has at its core the fundamental desire to improve the quality of le of those in our communities who need housing related support at any particular time.“However, the standards of living and quality of le frontline workers are experiencing does not reflect the work they complete, as a result of substandard terms and conditions of employment increasingly pushing them into debt, putting them at risk of homelessness and forcing them to use foodbanks.”‘Amoral employers’The UNISON delegation attending the Public Consultation impressed upon the NIHE that the current measures in place to protect frontline workers were inadequate and gave “unscrupulous employers” too much power. “Power which they use to disadvantage many workers whilst their inner circles led lavish lestyles on enhance contracts of employment,” Mr McCarroll added.He said the decision-making on how to manage staffing is at the behest of Supporting People funded organisations, this needs to change.UNISON told the NIHE that the current consultation process in place, designed to improve service delivery for vulnerable people would achieve nothing and fall short of any objectives,frontline staff were not valued and respected within the programme.The NIHE estimate that frontline workers should be in receipt of band  hourly rates with no mention of other band  terms and conditions such as sick pay or sht allowances. UNISON challenged this benchmarking estimate and its lack of detail in other areas, stating this was not the reality for many Supporting People Programme workers.Mr McCarroll continued: “A UNISON delegation of frontline workers will be meeting with the NIHE to further discuss our members’ concerns and we thank the NIHE for agreeing to continue the discussions on how best to protect and value workers, not forgetting that we are all involved in this programme to work together changing the lives of vulnerable people.“UNISON would like to put on record our appreciation of the position and approach taken by the NIHE in engaging with the trade unions and our continued disappointment at the right wing, anti-trade union position and approach taken by some Supporting People funded employers.“These employers operate with an arrogant, delusionary sense of entitlement, the UNISON led Supporting People Campaign will expose these employers and continue to organise workers to stand up and fight, bringing to an end the increasingly shaky gravy train which stops only at head office, bypassing frontline services.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh\"Head office staff receive  months full sick pay while frontline workers receive just  week in any year.  This particular contractual entitlement along with signicant dferences in take home pay is leaving frontline workers feeling undervalued.\"A NIHE spokesperson said the objective of the consultation is to hear the views of service providers, current and potential service users and their families and carers to enable the Housing Executive to identy the best option and approach for implementing this recommendation.The consultation runs for  weeks, it began on  June  and ends  August .Interested stakeholders are invited to participate by completing an online questionnaire at: https:consultations.nidirect.gov.uk nihe-supporting-people srpr"},{"url":null,"title":"waterfoot park residents take council task proposed construction development","story":"Derry City and Strabane District Councilhas pledged to engage fully with a group of residents in the Waterside after they accused the local authority of failing to fulfil their obligations in relation to their objections to a potential building development in their district.In July last year, residents of Waterfoot Park in the city lodged a formal objection to plans for a housing development in the area seeking to construct four semi-detached houses, two detached houses and six, two-bedroomed apartments.The Waterfoot Park residents objected to the proposed development on several grounds which included the potential impact of the construction project on existing properties at the site and that the planning application had not indicated accurate separation and height dferences between the proposed new project and the existing homes.A statement from the Waterfoot Park Residents Objectors Committee to the Derry News said: “The proposed dwellings are three stories in height on ground over two metres higher than the existing houses with restricted separation distances between both.“The layout would result in loss of privacy, natural light, sunlight and overbearing dominance, creating a sense of being hemmed in for us existing residents living adjacent to the boundary line.“Our concerns are also for the natural habitat of wildle species and the overall vast vegetation and trees. No details were provided on how existing vegetation will be retained and no bioersity checklist was provided.”The residents also employed planning consultant Lee Kennedy, who told the Council of his concerns that some demolition work to existing buildings on the proposed development site had already taken place, prior to planning approval and that trees had been felled along the rear boundary of the site close to the homes of the objectors.A spokesperson for the Waterfoot residents said: “Mr Kennedy went onto state that residents have expressed genuine fears about a threat to the remaining vegetation on the application site.“He reminded Council that they hold a duty of care to work in the public interest and offer protection to the remaining mature trees, by the serving of a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderunder the  Planning Act.”Mr Kennedy confirmed to the Derry News that he had submitted a request for a TPO from the Council, but “no action had been taken.”However, the Waterfoot Park residents say their fears were heightened again earlier this month when a team of workers appeared on the proposed development site and began to cut down more trees.A spokesperson for the residents told the Derry News: “On Friday, July  at .am the neighbours were woken with the sound of several power saws and saw a full team of tree cutters on site behind them.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Within an hour they had created absolute mayhem on the site, with trees felled all around and they were left when they fell. The ground and houses nearby vibrated and caused house alarms to go off.“Some neighbours felt very intimidated, shocked and panicked with the suddenness, noise level and by the time of the morning it happened. The residents are up in arms. It should never have been allowed to happen as Council was made aware last year about their responsibility of a duty of care to work in the public interest. The residents feel unsupported to date in their endeavours to the Council.”Addressing the residents’ concerns, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said that: “During the processing of the application,  objections have been received to the proposed development.“Correspondence to the Planning Department from Planning Consultant, Mr Lee Kennedy acting on behalf of the objectors, was received on August ,  and raised concerns regarding the trees on the site, and a request for a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderto be served on the site.“These concerns were raised with the Planning Department’s Tree Preservation Officer on September ,  who advised on September , that in his professional opinion, a TPO was not appropriate for this site given the nature, type and scale of trees.”On April  this year, Planning Department officials met with objectors at the city’s Council offices, where again, the Tree Preservation Officer advised that a TPO was considered but was unnecessary when assessed against the criteria required for a TPO.The Council spokesperson continued: “The site was further inspected by planning officers on June ,  and officers met with objectors on site.“More recently, the case officer wrote to the agent and the applicant on June ,  to advise that further information was required. Amongst other things requested, the case officer advised that a tree survey of the site was required, a landscaping plan to show existing trees and vegetation to be retained and additional planting to be shown and a bioersity checklist was to be submitted to advise on any existing ecology on the site.“The agent confirmed in correspondence dated, July  that a Phase  habitat survey was instructed to be carried out as well as a tree survey and would be submitted in due course.”However, the Council spokesperson added: “The Planning Department were made aware by an objector by email on July ,  that eight trees along the boundary of the site adjacent to properties in Waterfoot Park had been felled on July  at .am.“Council takes its obligations in respect of these matters seriously and has undertaken an appropriate course of action to ensure that the opinions of residents are and will be fully considered in the processing of the planning application.”CAPTION: Residents of Waterfoot Park have accused the Council of failing to provide a duty of care in relation to a proposed building development."},{"url":null,"title":"prime minister s powys visit","story":"Prime minister Boris Johnson visitedBVG Retail Group in Brecon last Tuesday ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtth July ..Picturltspan classtruncate-full-screengted is Boris Johnson talking to County Times Chief Reporter Rory Sheehan..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Prime Minister’s Powys visitPrime minister Boris Johnson visitedBVG Retail Group in Brecon last Tuesday ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtth July ..Picturltspan classtruncate-full-screengted is Boris Johnson and Chris Davies talking to County Times Chief Reporter Rory Sheehan..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Prime Minister’s Powys visitPrime minister Boris Johnson visitedBVG Retail Group in Brecon last Tuesday ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtth July ..Picturltspan classtruncate-full-screengted is Boris Johnson, Iain Burgessand Chris Davies..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Prime Minister’s Powys visitPrime minister Boris Johnson visitedBVG Retail Group in Brecon last Tuesday ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtth July ..Picturltspan classtruncate-full-screengte by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Prime Minister’s Powys visitPrime minister Boris Johnson visitedBVG Retail Group in Brecon last Tuesday ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtth July ..Picturltspan classtruncate-full-screengted is Boris Johnson meeting members of staff..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"machynlleth carnival 2019 event celebrates","story":"Moon landers : Olivia Garrod , Harry Smithand Izzy Owen ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgt drop in on Machynllltspan classtruncate-full-screengteth Carnival.

If we all do a little bit, wersquoll ensure the service is maintained for today, tomorrow and future generations.Earlier this year, local politicians agreed to take the lead in securing financial support for the air ambulance service and also make a monetary contribution to help meet the servicersquos poundm annual running costs.The Department of Health allocates around poundm in annual funding to help keep the helicopter service in the air with money used to finance the air ambulance crew, medicines and medical equipment. Charity funds, including public donations, sustains the aviation side of the operation.It was announced recently that as part of the ongoing consultation on reshaping stroke services, the Department has made a commitment to extend the partnership with Air Ambulance Northern Irelandto enable the helicopter emergency medical service to provide a secondary response to incidents, including strokes, by .Health officials have also confirmed that any changes to the existing arrangement would be subject to the completion of an appropriate business case and agreement with the air ambulance with regard to any funding implications..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charity Beer and Bubbles 5k run in Finnebrogue  ","story":"M B McGRADY  Co Chartered Accountants is setting the pace this September with the launch of the Beer and Bubbles k run in a bid to raise money for Air Ambulance NI.Open to competitors of all ages and experiences, the race will take place on Thursday, September , at Finnebrogue Woods, nestled on the outskirts of Downpatrick.This is the first k race to take place at the idyllic venue, with the route mapped out so runners take in the stunning woodland and finish close to the lakeside, where they will be able to soak up the atmosphere while enjoying a glass of local beer or prosecco.The event follows on from last yearrsquos successful M B Grady  Co Ultimate Aqua Challenge,.Conaill McGrady, director of M B McGrady  Co, said: ldquoWe are delighted to be supporting Air Ambulance NI for a second year and helping to contribute to maintaining the vital work that they do.

Fantastic work from Seaacuten Tucker around the middle of the park and his long ball into the danger area found Marty Cox in space.Cox caught the ball in mid-air, landed and turned in one motion before smashing the ball past Michael Ferrand, who had no chance. The sizable crowd roared with delight and momentum was now with St Paulrsquos as Tucker added another score from play.Once again, however, ill discipline and poor tackling would cost St Paulrsquos.

The game was tied at - to - drawing at  when St Paulrsquosadded their second goal in the th minute.Fine work from Daniel Eastwood and Cox set up Tucker who danced around two Bright defenders before slotting the ball home from  metres. The home crowd were again in raptures, expecting St Paulrsquos to see the game out.However, game management has been a big problem this season for the Holywood men, given the average age of the team is  it is perhaps understandable that experience to see games out is just not there yet.St Paulrsquos tried to slow the game down, but with about  minutes still to be played, it was far too early for that. Bright caught St Paulrsquos in possession on numerous occasionsand turned the ball over for score after score.George was a constant threat and punished each mistake by the Holywood men with a score. Ably assisted by Freddie OrsquoConnor, the pair hauled the St Paulrsquos lead in until it was all square by the th minute.They again caught St Paulrsquos out and OrsquoConnor scored the winning point in the st minute.St Paulrsquos: Craig McKenna, Owen Loughran, Conor McPeake, Ryan Loughran, Ruairi Collins, Paddy Falls, Michael Collins , Gerard Walls, Patrick Eastwood, Martin Cox , Seaacuten Tucker , Daniel Eastwood, Barry Kilkey , Conor McAnespie .

Two special zones will be developed for car parking on either side of the beach and a park for upwards of  cars will be provided in the centre, off the beach area.Under no circumstances, however, will cars be allowed to drive up and down the beach area and the council is expected to appoint full-time beach inspectors to supervise parking during the summer season.The private entrances presently used by beach-goers will be blocked off and two new public driveways will be constructed.

The space was sad and neglected before and now is interesting, welcoming and inviting truly a space for all our learners to explore their senses.

It really warms our hearts to see what wersquove been able to do in four weeks.Blisse Mellons, , and her mother Laura were already using the gardens. ldquoShe likes this one a lot.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Of those,  have been empty for more than two years.Landlords will be given incentives to bring long term empty properties into use as the council says they attract crime and anti-social behaviour, drive down values and become ldquodetrimental to the lives of residents.Measures are set out in a draft strategy which the councilrsquos cabinet, on July , agreed to publish for public consultation.While the council wants landlords to accept help to get homes in use, the strategy says theauthority will take actionnecessary.Vale council deputy leader Cllr Lis Burnett told the meeting she was ldquostunned more than  homes in the Vale have been empty for more than two years.ldquoItrsquos absolutely staggering, she said. ldquoA strategy on a way we can tackle it is very welcome.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He added that he was open to talks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he believed there had been some suggestion the Withdrawal Agreement was an ldquoinvention of the Dublin government or had been imposed by the European Union.ldquoThatrsquos not the case, he said. ldquoTherersquos an attempt to make out that itrsquos undemocratic too but itrsquos been agreed by  governments, including the UK Government, and the European Parliament, all of which followed democratic procedures.Earlier, Mr Donohoe said while a deal was ldquostill possible, the prospect of no deal had increased.He was in London as he met Chancellor Sajid Javid to discuss the UK Governmentrsquos latest plans for exiting the EU.Speaking to the BBCrsquos Newsnight programme, he said a deal could be done.He added: ldquoI believe it is still possible that we could see agreements in which Britain enters into a transition agreement in advance of them finally departing before the European Union.ldquoBut as I stand now, Irsquod have to be equally clear in saying that I do believe that the prospect of a no-deal Brexit has grown.ldquoI believe that a no-deal Brexit and the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without a deal is a very credible and material risk now. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Irish Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe met with Chancellor Sajid Javid  --Mr Donohoe said the appointment of Mr Johnson as Prime Minister had ldquoadded a new dynamic to Brexit talks.ldquoI believe Prime Minister Johnson feels dferently about the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union and the future trust of that relationship to how Prime Minister May would have, he said.ldquoAnd I believe that has added a new dynamic into where we are in Brexit.ldquoBut in acknowledging that there is a new dynamic, I am also crystal clear that the views of the Irish government and the views of Ireland in relation to the backstop, the Withdrawal Agreement and our future in the European Union, which have been affirmed again and again, that would not be changing.Speaking to journalists at the Irish embassy after his meeting with Mr Javid, Mr Donohoe warned the relationship between the UK and Ireland would ldquofundamentally change in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Earlier in the day, Michael Gove accused the EU of refusing to engage in negotiations on a new Brexit deal. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, who is in charge of no-deal preparations, said he was ldquodeeply saddened by the EU position, which was ldquonot in Europersquos interests.ldquoWe will put all our energy into making sure that we can secure that good deal but at the moment it is the EU that seems to be saying they are not interested, he said.ldquoThey are simply saying lsquoNo, we donrsquot want to talkrsquo. I think that is wrong and sad.On Tuesday evening, at a political discussion in Belfast, Mr Varadkar said calls by Sinn Fein for a border poll in the event of a no-deal Brexit were ldquoisive.He added: ldquoI think it would result in some of the mistakes made  years ago, when partition happened, being repeated but just the other way around ndash a huge number of people, those from a unionist, British, Ulster background, being brought into a united Ireland against their will..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Varadkar: Drop red lines and then we can talk about new Brexit deal article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A statement, signed by  business organisations and trade bodies, says that “two and a half years on from the collapse of the Executive, and now approaching the likely conclusion of the Brexit process, the Northern Ireland business community is deeply concerned at the continued absence of a ing administration and is calling on political representatives to redouble their efforts to reach agreement to get the Assembly and Executive working again”. “There has seldom been a time when strong and effective leadership has been more necessary, both to deliver on the domestic agenda and also to speak up for Northern Ireland in the Brexit process. “We need a fully ing administration to agree and deliver a Programme for Government that will build infrastructure, reform our health service and education system, ensure we have a strong economy, and create opportunities for our young people. We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise. Without such a commitment and associated action from our elected representatives, we risk irreparable damage to our economy and our society for which future generations will judge us harshly.””  The letter has been signed by the following organisations: Belfast Chamber Causeway Chamber of Commerce CBI NI Centre for Competitiveness Construction Employers Federation NI Federation of Small Businesses Northern Ireland Freight Transport Association Hospitality Ulster IoD NI Londonderry Chamber of Commerce Manufacturing NI Mineral Products Association NI Newry Chamber of Commerce  Trade NI Grain Trade Association NI Hotels Federation NI Tourism Alliance Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association Northern Ireland Retail Consortium Retail NI Women in Business NIView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/qub_1.jpg","title":"ulster business top  sees sales rise by ","story":"Posted on Monday August  by Ulster Business Michael Neill, head of office, AL Goodbody Belfast, sponsor of the Top , Flavio Malnarcic, chief financial officer, Moy Park and Ulster Business editor John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest businesses have seen sales rise by .% to more £.bn, the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies list  has revealed.The list, sponsored by AL Goodbody, showcases the successes of the biggest firms from right across Northern Ireland.
