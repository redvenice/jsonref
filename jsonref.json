\u0027significant number of teaching staff\u0027 were off due to Covid-related reasons, the i reported. Heads at Marlbrook Primary School in Hereford have also made the decision to cancel assemblies and permit children to only socialise with other year groups when outdoors.Meanwhile, Herts and Essex High School in Hertfordshire and Thurston Community College in Suffolk are holding online assemblies to avoid school-wide gatherings. A primary school in Oxford has also called-off all large school gatherings.The Government lifted Covid restrictions placed on schools — including face masks and bubbles — earlier this year as part of No10\u0027s drive to learn to live with the virus. But ministers published guidance in August, which set out that some measures could be brought back to manage local outbreaks, respond to variants of concern or prevent the NHS from becoming overwhelmed. Hundreds of primaries and secondaries in Staffordshire were urged to be \u0027proactive\u0027 and not wait on official guidance from the Government, it was reported last month. Some schools in Wales were advised last month to cancel assemblies where the entire school was in attendance. Scotland, which saw record-high infections in August after pupils returned to classrooms, has told schools to avoid assemblies and other large gatherings.Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said schools are suffering from staffing problems and rising numbers of students missing school due to Covid. He told the i: \u0027This is happening despite staff being vaccinated, with the problem exacerbated by an acute shortage of suitably qualified supply staff. \u0027Leaders are therefore deciding to cancel activity that isn\u0027t crucial to the school day, such as leading assemblies, as many of them are having to step up to frontline teaching to cover staff absence. \u0027They may also consider that cancelling assemblies, attended by large groups of students, could help reduce the risk of further infection.\u0027Mr Barton said the rollout of Covid vaccines to pupils aged 12 to 15 is \u0027key\u0027 for bringing down cases, \u0027but this has been slow to get underway in many areas and beset by logistical problems\u0027. He added: \u0027The Government had originally hoped to have the vaccination programme complete by the half-term holiday but this is patently not now going to happen.\u0027But he noted that plans announced yesterday for youngsters to get jabbed at walk-in centres is a \u0027very sensible\u0027 approach.  James Bowen, director of policy for the National Association of Head Teachers, told the i some schools and local authorities have decided to ban students gathering in large numbers.\u0027Often this means an

this relatively minor change to the school day seems a sensible short-term measure to protect pupils and staff. Until the Government gets on top of Covid transmission in schools, disruption like this will only continue.\u0027It comes after Professor Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist who sits on SAGE, yesterday called for Britain to follow Europe\u0027s lead in giving teenagers two Covid vaccines

inflation dips transport food households factories ftse sterling energy business","story":"Rising petrochemical prices are also pushing up the cost of paint. Dutch paints and coatings maker Akzo Nobel warned this morning that “significant raw material cost inflation and supply constraints” are expected to continue until the middle of next year. The Dulux-maker said raw material inflation continued to intensify in the third quarter of the year. Its raw material and other variable costs increased by €278m compared with Q3 2020. But operating income dropped (to €226m from €326m in in 2020), as higher prices were “more than offset” by the impact of higher costs and lower sales volumes. Thierry Vanlancker, chief executive of Akzo Nobel, said that the cost pressures and supply shortages were widespread across many inputs including petrochemicals, additives and metal packaging. He told the Financial Times: UK petrol retailers have warned that prices at the pumps could hit record levels by the end of the month, adding to the cost of living squeeze. Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, says that the previous records are “almost certain to be eclipsed before the end of October”. Back in April 2012, petrol hit a record high of 142p per litre while diesel reached 148p per litre. Prices are nearing that level, the PRA warns, with Experian Catalist UK averages hitting 141.35p per litre for petrol yesterday, and 144.84p per litre for diesel. Madderson says this increase is being driven by higher oil prices. Brent crude hit a three-year high over $85 per barrel last week, up from around $51 at the start of the year. The Opec+ group slashed production last year, and is sticking to its policy of gradually increasing production by 400,000 barrels per month - despite the White House urging them to pump faster.  Madderson adds that motorists haven’t seen the full impact of rising oil prices: Last week, AA data showed that petrol had hit 140p for the highest since the record levels in 2012 (on a nominal basis, not adjusted for inflation). The PRA also flags that the petrochemical industry is buying up more distillates that would otherwise be used for petrol. Heating oil - which is in higher demand following the surge in gas prices - comes from the same part of the barrel as diesel. The PRA, which represents independent fuel retailers, says: Weidmann will leave Germany’s central bank at the end of the year for personal reasons, which will remove one of the hawkish voices at the ECB. During his time on the ECB’s Governing Council, Weidmann often clashed with more dovish policymakers over the stimulus measures, and record low interest rates, introduced during the eurozone crisis. Weidmann issued a new warning about inflation risks in his farewell message, telling Bundesbank staff that: Carsten Brzeski, ING’s Global Head of Macro, says Weidmann’s departure comes at a crucial time for the ECB.  That lifted the average house price to £264,000 in August 2021, £25,000 higher than a year earlier. The stamp duty holiday ended in Wales at the end of June, and finished in Scotland back in March. It was halved in England in Wales at the start of July, and ended last month. Jamie Durham, economist at PwC, says the housing market has “clearly remained strong”. In the world of luxury, Burberry has appointed Jonathan Akeroyd as its next chief executive in a deal including a £6m “golden hello” to cover the loss of bonus and share awards for leaving his position as boss of rival Versace. The 54-year-old has been the boss of Versace since 2016, overseeing the $2.1bn sale of the business to Michael Kors three years ago. Burberry’s outgoing chief executive, Marco Gobbetti, is due to leave Britain’s biggest high fashion brand to take the top job at luxury Italian group Salvatore Ferragamo at the end of the year. Akeroyd, who previously spent 12 years at Alexander McQueen leading the brand through the aftermath of the death of its eponymous founder, will join Burberry on 1 April next year. The British national previously also held a number of senior fashion roles at London’s luxury department store Harrods. The food delivery platform, which has performed strongly during the coronavirus pandemic, with customers often under lockdown restrictions, reported 35.8m orders in the third quarter compared with 22.6m in the same period last year. More here. NIESR says that short-term inflationary pressures, such as rising energy bills, supply chain disruption and labour shortages, will lift consumer prices higher in the coming months. Janine Boshoff, Economist for Macroeconomic Modelling and Forecasting, says: In a stinging rebuke, the Competition and Markets Authority says the social media giant failed to comply with the ‘initial enforcement order (IEO) imposed in June 2020 when it began its investigation into its Giphy purchase. The IEO is meant to ensure companies continue to run as separate businesses while a takeover is investigated, preventing them from integrating. Facebook was required to provide regular updates showing it was complying with this IEO. But, the CMA says, Facebook “significantly limited the scope of those updates”, despite repeated warnings. The CMA says this is the first time a company has breached an IEO by consciously refusing to report all the required information. And given the multiple warnings it gave Facebook, the CMA considers that this failure to comply was deliberate.  As a result, the CMA has issued a fine of £50 million for this “major breach”, which the regulator says “fundamentally undermined its ability to prevent, monitor and put right any issues”. The CMA has also fined Facebook £500,000 for changing its Chief Compliance Officer on two separate occasions without seeking consent first. Joel Bamford, senior director of mergers at the CMA, said the fine is “a warning to any company that thinks it is above the law.” Giphy supplies animated gifs to social networks such as Snapchat, TikTok and Twitter.  In August, the CMA said Facebook could be forced to sell Giphy after an investigation found its takeover could harm competition among social media companies and the digital advertising market. Facebook, which owns Instagram and WhatsApp, has denied that owning Giphy will hurt competition.

Photograph: Tom HonanThe Government officials will meet with representatives of the hospitality sector on Wednesday afternoon to discuss anomalies that have arisen ahead of a further relaxation of restrictions from Friday including the reopening of nightclubs. Representatives from the Restaurants Association, Hotel Federation and the two Publican associations will meet with officials from the Department of Tourism, and the Department of Enterprise, at 3pm. On Tuesday, The Cabinet gave the green light to allow the reopening of sectors that had remained closed until now, including nightclubs and live entertainment. The decision was contingent on a robust regime where proof of immunity would have to be shown for indoor hospitality and events. However, the decision gave rise to several inconsistencies between sectors. For example, dancing will be allowed in nightclubs but pubs and restaurants will be confined to table service with patrons not allowed to stand or sit at the bar. In addition, groups of no larger than ten are allowed in those establishments similar limits will not apply to nightclubs. In addition, nightclub operators are unsure of the protocols and rules that will apply to their venues when they reopen. A spokesman for Minister for Tourism Catherine Martin said it had been engaging with representatives of the hospitality industry collectively since the Government decision was made. It also said there had been ongoing engagement with groups and iniduals involved with the live music and events sector and that engagement would continue. “The key issues are around the anomalies that might arise and we are listening to the sector and working towards (resolving the issues),” said the spokesman. The State tourism agency, Fáilte Ireland, is in the process of updating operational guidelines to reflect the updated health advice. Officials from the Departments of Tourism and Enterprise will attend today’s meeting. Adrian Cummins, chief executive of the Restaurant Association, said on Wednesday that several anomalies had arisen from the decision. He pointed to a situation where a restaurant would not be in a position to host a function, as there was a maximum of ten people per table. “A hotel down the road can hold a black tie dinner for example attended by 100 people but restaurants don’t know if they would be allowed to do the same, with ten tables with a maximum of 10 people at each table.”Speaking at Government Buildings on Wednesday morning, Mr Martin also said he will be seeking more regular compliance reports about the use of Covid-19 vaccination certs by businesses.Asked about criticism about the lack of clarity, Mr Martin said: “To be honest my main concern is to protect public health and to protect people’s safety and lives, and we need to get a sense of perspective in the debate.“This morning there are 464 people in hospital. There were 74 in intensive care. These are real people. We want to keep those numbers down. “Unfortunately, over the last two weeks the situation has gotten worse. That’s the context in which we have announced a cautious further reopening of sectors of society.”Mr Martin indicated a stricter regime in terms of checking Covid-19 certificates is on the cards.“I’ll be looking for more regular compliance reports in respect of adherence to the presentation of the vaccination cert and other protective measures. And I’ve asked the secretary general to compile that report and the regulatory forum is meeting today which is made up of bodies around compliance.”‘Incomprehensible’Nightclub operators say they need to see guidelines so that they can understand what the rules will be around social distancing and the wearing of masks, and so they can decide whether they are feasible.Donall O’Keeffe, chief executive of the Licensed Vintners Association (LVA), who represent pubs and late bars in Dublin, said publicans had “no idea” how the rules were going to work. In many cases nightclubs in Dublin city operated as normal bars during earlier hours, and several pubs had a separate club section, he said. “The reality is every late bar in Dublin is an ordinary bar until 10pm or 11pm … There’s very few true ‘nightclubs’, even Coppers had a carvery during the day,” he said. There was no separate “nightclub license” to distinguish between clubs and late bars, he said. In the Dáil Labour leader Alan Kelly described the proposals for the re-opening of nightclubs as “unworkable and incomprehensible”.He told Taoiseach Micheál Martin that he had “put the cart before the horse” and should have consulted the entertainment sector ahead of the Government’s announcement on Tuesday about the re-opening.Dave Parle of Hidden Agenda Promotions, who run gigs and club nights in The Big Romance bar on Parnell St, criticised the uncertainty venues had been left with days before the reopening. “We have club events for Friday which it looks like it’s allowed to go ahead, but we’re still figuring out some of the mechanics of actually operating a club show,” he said. “The phrase about there being some anomalies, by Micheál Martin I think, is probably an understatement,” he told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland. “In practicality there’s a plethora of anomalies at the minute that we’re experiencing - for example I have a show on Friday week and it’s a live show, but it’s 9pm doors that goes on until 3am, so it’s kind of in a club setting and I have no idea if that’s allowed within the current guidelines,” he said. There was particular confusion for venues that functioned as pubs, which also put on club nights, he said. “Often how those venues would function is they will have a gig at 8pm, that would finish at around 11pm and then they would move into their club setting,” Mr Parle said. “What we’re trying to wrap our heads around is are we saying that those 8pm gigs can’t happen, but if the band played later at night, during the late licence section of the evening - is that allowed to proceed with a dance floor?,” he said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics inside ten years as a government advisor with ed brophy","story":"Ed Brophy is a former chief of staff to finance minister Paschal Donohoe and to Labour’s Joan Burton when she was Tánaiste.

There would be dancing again in dimly lit places where lips collide and drink is served into the early hours.Nightclubs would reopen and live full capacity concerts would resume and people would be allowed sit once more at a bar counter in a public house prior to falling into a dimly lit place after midnight.But on Tuesday, it fell to the Taoiseach to break the bad news to the Dáil.“The virus has taken a turn for the worst” announced Micheál Martin, with a heavy heart. “The trajectory went kinda wrong over the last two weeks.”Not only that, but Covid’s setback is now further compromised by a severe case of The Anomalies. Nobody understands The Anomalies, not least the government. But they are causing severe anxiety for the hospitality and entertainment industry.Covid’s worsening condition has put the kibosh on a full reopening of these sectors. Or has it?Immediately before the Dáil sitting, the Government held a press conference to outline details of the long awaited and much anticipated return of carousing. But after all the talking the rules for re-engagement were clear as mud.Neither the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste nor the leader of the Green Party were in a position to offer a solid prognosis for how Ireland will cope with Covid in the coming months while complications arising from The Anomalies left them sounding very hazy on detail about Friday’s lifting of restrictions.It’ll be February now at the earliest before they can give any sort of long-term update.Here’s Leo Varadkar - he is a qualified doctor: “You know, the absolutely easiest thing to do is to shut down the country and the second easiest thing to do is to open it up fully” mused Dr Leo, prodding the landscape around Covid’s distended belly.Yep. Just as he suspected.“Everything between is full of anomalies and full of complications.”‘Evolve, develop and deliver’What to do?“We have to help provide the pass, the mask, the test and the boost” said Eamon Ryan. The sectors which have been waiting to get going for nearly two years will get “further details” as they reopen and “we are going to have to evolve, develop and deliver.”The three leaders stressed that the usual basics - masks, hand hygiene and social distancing - will apply across the board, except where anomalies arise in which case “sector-specific guidance and protocols” will be dispensed.Did this mean social distancing might not be required in nightclubs?To dance or not to dance - that is the simple question.“So, I’m not going into the specific details” Micheál told Sean Defoe of Newstalk. “It’s the generality.”Just three days out from their big reopening, after months and months of discussion about it, do hard pressed club and music venue owners not deserve more than mere “generality”?And then the Taoiseach told his (predominantly) youthful audience of political reporters “what traditionally happens in a nightclub will continue to happen in a nightclub.”That got a knowing laugh from the crowd.Under the new carousing code, the ban on pub patrons approaching or sitting at a bar counter continues. But in a club, they will be able to sashay up and order what they want.Then there are the live music concerts in big venues. Strictly no dancing in the aisles. No standing up. Sitting down dancing only, and socially distanced at that. It’s the sanitised hand jive or nothing. Where’s the sense in that, with tickets already sold out for major standing events on the back of the Government’s promise of an October 22nd reopening?Micheál muttered about “practical arrangements” having to be made in some circumstances.“There will be anomalies - straight up with you. There will be anomalies.”Sketchy proposalsIn the Dáil, Catherine Murphy, co-leader of the Social Democrats, couldn’t get her head around the sketchy proposals currently causing consternation in the nighttime hospitality sector.“It’s very confusing” she sighed, blasting the Government for “yet another startling display of confusion, incoherence and chaos.” She forgot to mention “contradiction”.Three days out from reopening and the rules have been rewritten with business closed for the best part of two years going to “get advice at the last possible moment” on how to start up again. Ah well.“You could probably dance to the bar for a drink,” she supposed.But the reason the rejigged restrictions are so late in the day is because Covid took a turn for the worst when nobody was expecting it, argued the Taoiseach. “Covid does not respect weekly decision making on a precision basis.”His Cabinet gets no credit for anything. The Oppostion was dead set against previous restrictions and measures brought in by the Government. They screamed blue murder over the introduction of vaccination certificates last Summer, yet this facilitated the reopening of much of the hospitality industry.“Anything we have reopened so far has stayed open” sniffed Micheál, yet he wasn’t hearing any Oppostion voices the Opposition. “Always trying to pick holes.”Aontú’s Peadar Tóibín wanted a Dáil debate on the Government’s handling of the crisis. Ireland has severe restrictions and high vaccination rates yet Covid numbers are high and rising.“By any measure this is a disaster and failure of government,” said Tóibín.The Taoiseach rejected his assertion and his “completely wrong and inappropriate” language. “I know enough about a global pandemic - they can come back to bite you at anytime” he told Peadar.The Government’s latest decision was “taking note of the fact that the trajectory of the virus has taken a turn for the worse”.The mean some key protections had to be retained, such as “the vaccination cert, which I know you were virulently against” and masks and other issues where appropriate.Micheál’s statement enraged the Meath TD, who returned to the House before the Taoiseach left demanding an apology. Aontú was never “anti-mask” he fulminated. “That is absolutely not true,” he shouted.Bernard Durkan, in the chair, battled to maintain order. As the shouting intensified, Bernard was in danger of becoming more airborne than the Covid virus. The Taoiseach, meanwhile, watched briefly then gathered his papers and left.Deputy Tóibín said he had the audio of this “slur” for evidence. But perhaps, if he plays it again, he might find that the Taoiseach did not call him or his party anti-maskers. It was merely his Cork cadence confusing the matter.As if any more confusion was needed."},{"url":null,"title":"td calls for time limited amnesty for young people recruited as money mules","story":"Gardaí expressed concern that such a large number of young people were willing to allow their accounts to be used. Photograph: iStockA call has been made for a “strictly time-limited amnesty” for young people recruited to act as money mules for an international crime syndicate.Independent TD Marian Harkin made the appeal in the wake of a report in The  that gardaí had identified more than 50 young people around one Co Kerry town who were recruited by a Munster teenager to allow their bank accounts be used to receive money from frauds carried out by the gang.She said amnesties had previously been offered to those who owed tax and “we should at least investigate” whether it can be done for people who have been caught up in this web of exploitation.Gardaí expressed concern that such a large number of young people in a relatively sparsely populated part of the Republic were so willing to allow their accounts to be used.And Ms Harkin warned that “recruiters are most likely working right across the country right now” and she suspected that many of these young people “do not realise what is happening and just see this activity as a handy way to make a few bob or even do a favour for a mate”.She warned that some would become trapped “because the people who want to exert pressure on them, now or later, have leverage on them”.“These are our sons, daughters, nieces, nephews and grandchildren. We have a duty to act now.“We may need to look at some kind of strictly time-limited amnesty to give cover to young people who have been caught up in this web of exploitation.”She was speaking during a Dáil debate on the transposition of an EU anti-money laundering directive into domestic Irish law.The directive provides for the creation of a centralised bank account register by all member states, which will be accessible through a single access point and available to designated authorities across the EU investigating crime.The measures would allow investigators to trace, freeze and confiscate criminal assets quickly before the proceeds can disappear. Under current rules it can take up to 30 days through bilateral agreements.In the debate Labour TD Sean Sherlock also expressed concern that the mistake made by young people in allowing their accounts be used could follow them throughout life.He asked if their accounts and names be permanently listed on the EU-wide database.“There is always an imbalance between the crime lords and the mules. The mules are always the first to be subject to the rigours of the law and the crime lords walk off into the sunset or Marbella or wherever they happen to be.”He said the Kerry cased involved teenagers, some of whom would know quite well what they were up to but others would be “led on and naive”. Mr Sherlock feared “they could be forever blacklisted in any financial transactions they have”.Minister of State James Browne, who introduced the EU directive motion and spoke before the Kerry case was raised, said access to the database would be available only to financial intelligence units.

If you didn’t notice, Parliament has quietly extended the Government’s emergency Covid powers for another six months.   We know where this will lead. The Prime Minister will fend off the Fergusons for a while – all the more so this time around because he won’t want to spoil his big party in Glasgow (although what is allowed to happen there will depend on Nicola Sturgeon). But eventually he will capitulate, and will appear in his Downing Street briefing room telling us that there is no option other than to send us all back to our hidey holes and await the all-clear, quite possibly some time next spring.There is no visible strategy behind any of this. We have become prisoners of the daily Covid numbers. When they rise, ministers start panicking. When they rise fast enough to present as a straight upwards line on one of Chris Whitty’s graphs, they panic a little more. When Ferguson or one of Sage’s modelling teams present a graph projecting that deaths have a theoretical chance of exceeding some previous peak, the game is up – we’re in lockdown.   Meanwhile, the Government has started to drift on its one genuine achievement: the vaccination programme. Having once led the world, we have stalled with 66.5 per cent of the population fully-vaccinated – well behind former laggards like Italy (70.2 per cent) and Spain (79.3 per cent). Ministers prevaricated over whether or not booster shots would be needed, with the result they started late. Only 27.8 per cent of care home residents and 14.1 per cent of staff have received a third booster jab. The Government, too, last month cancelled an order for 100 million doses of the French-developed Valneva vaccine, which, according to trial results published this week, seems to be more effective than the AstraZeneca jab. Before we start to disappear down the rabbit hole once more, one small reform I would like is this: for the Government to stop simply publishing raw figures of new Covid infections, hospitalisations with Covid and deaths. Instead it should publish statistics on mortality from all causes, broken down by age – so we can see Covid cases in their proper context. If the Government published similar figures for pneumonia and influenza and we started agonising over them, we would never fully open society, certainly not in winter. Secondly, wouldn’t it be helpful if the Government broke down its Covid figures to show how many of those deaths and hospitalisations were among vaccinated people and how many among unvaccinated people?  Publishing such figures might even be just the incentive the Government needs to persuade the rest of the population to be vaccinated. Never mind vaccination passports, just give us the facts – how many of the seriously-ill are vaccinated and how many are not – and leave us to make up our own minds. It might well turn out to be the difference between freedom and lockdown. More from NewsWhat will the monarchy look like when Prince Charles becomes king?Politics latest news: Winter lockdown ruled out by minister despite his \u0026#39concerns\u0026#39 over slow booster rollout\u0026#39To retrofit them only works under certain circumstances\u0026#39: Readers on the rush to heat pumpsWhat is the Government’s Plan B?

There have been endless interviews with political figures and leading journalists, all of whom have talked about language and the urgent need for a kinder, politer discourse. The consensus seems to be that the coarsening of public life in general is ultimately responsible for this shocking incident. Of course, occasionally politicians do go too far, and terms such as enemies of the people or scum are undeniably unhelpful. But politics has long been a rough and tumble business. Going back centuries, politicians have always teased and abused each other. In the early 1970s, for example, some backbench Labour MPs used to chant “Ditch the bitch” when Mrs Thatcher was addressing the Commons. Using that kind of language in the chamber would be unthinkable now, quite rightly, but my point is that it is wrong to attribute Sir David’s death to mere words.  It may well be true that the advent of the internet, and what is laughably called “social media”, has increased hatred towards iniduals. Indeed, having been on the receiving end of some of this myself, I regret it very much. But to blame Sir David’s killing on clear, open political debate would be to allow a woeful misdiagnosis to stand. Consider the assessment of the Labour MP Rupa Huq. She wrote in the  “We need to drain our politics of the bitter rancour: more being cross-party and less being cross.” This is typical of a narrative that has taken hold which ducks much tougher questions that must be asked if Britain is to remain a fully functioning democracy. The fact is that former friends of Ali Harbi Ali, the man suspected of killing Sir David, have claimed he watched videos of the Islamist hate preacher Anjem Choudary and became “obsessed” with him. Choudary was jailed in 2016 for five-and-a-half years following an Old Bailey trial at which he was convicted of inviting support for ISIS. He was released on licence from HMP Belmarsh in 2018. His licence conditions, which included a ban on public speaking and talking to the media, expired in July of this year.I would say that this grim type of “obsession” poses a threat to everyone in this country, whether they operate in public life or not. Unless our leaders are prepared to acknowledge this and confront it, it will not be possible to put in place the measures that will allow politicians to continue meeting constituents, making politics even more remote from people’s lives than it is already. I know more about living under the shadow of an approaching menace than almost anybody else in politics today. I had to endure it for years, though it was violent hard-left groups more than fundamentalist Islamic groups which were responsible. The only way that I could exist was to have private security with me. Even if my security detail did not always manage to stop the occasional attacker coming out of the crowd and bashing an egg over my head or throwing a milkshake over me, I am sure it did give me the protection I needed from anybody carrying a knife. Though it is depressing to say it, had Sir David had private security on Friday, I do not believe he would have been stabbed multiple times. That does not mean Sir David would not have been able to do his duty to his constituents. The fact that I was surrounded by security did not stop me going on street walkabouts, visiting markets, addressing public meetings or visiting pubs and shops. Members of the public were free to meet me and we interacted quite naturally. It was mildly inconvenient to have a security man with me, but I was able to carry on with my commitments.Some have suggested that police should be posted outside MPs’ surgeries from now on. I understand this emphasis on surgeries, as Sir David’s death marks the third attack on an MP’s surgery in the last 20 years. But I think a more logical idea is that whenever MPs are performing any kind of public duty or making any public appearance which has been announced in advance, they should have a right to a private security guard. The police do not have the resources to devote to MPs. However, there are hundreds of ex-servicemen in Britain who served in Iraq and Afghanistan who could do this job admirably. After all, they are used to handling terrorist threats and used to dealing with the public. Many of them have not yet fitted properly back into society since leaving the services yet, with the right training, I am sure this patriotic group of people would be more than happy to ensure our democratic process can continue. It is vital to add that Ali Harbi Ali was referred to the counter-extremism Prevent programme. Nobody can expect it to have a 100 per cent success rate, but I am appalled that the details of those who pass through it seem not to be automatically given to the security services and made available to police databases. Some will claim that this would encroach on the human rights of men like Ali Harbi Ali. To this I ask: what about the human rights of Sir David Amess and his family? More from NewsWhat will the monarchy look like when Prince Charles becomes king?Politics latest news: Winter lockdown ruled out by minister despite his \u0026#39concerns\u0026#39 over slow booster rollout\u0026#39To retrofit them only works under certain circumstances\u0026#39: Readers on the rush to heat pumpsWhat is the Government’s Plan B?

The sinophile collector, who died in 1964, believed it to be Ru ware but was unable to prove it definitively.Sometime in the 1970s, the piece was labelled by curators at the collection’s display site at 53 Gordon Square, London, as being of Korean origin. That attribution was because of large spur marks on the base of the dish, which were unlike the usual sesame-seed shaped marks found on other Ru items.The Sir Percival David Collection moved to a dedicated gallery in the British Museum in 2009, where the dish retained its Korean label.But Regina Krahl, an independent academic specialising in Asian ceramics, decided to examine the dish after recently discovering another mislabelled piece of Ru ware in the Dresden Porcelain Collection.After Mrs Krahl determined it probably was Ru ware, the British Museum brought in scientists from the Cranfield Forensic Institute who used handheld XRF X-ray technology to determine the chemical makeup of the ceramic glaze and finally vindicate Sir Percival’s original belief.Professor Andrew Shortland, director of Cranfield Forensic Institute, said he hoped other institutions and academics would be inspired to take on similar joint projects. “There is great potential for art historians, curators and scientists to work together to confirm the attribution of important problem pieces.”Ru ware is the rarest of all Imperial Chinese ceramics, with fewer than 100 examples worldwide. Its mystique, and accompanying value, comes from the romantic story around it, Jessica Harrison-Hall, head of the China Section at the British Museum, told The .The ceramics were produced by the Song dynasty for a brief two-decade period in the late 11th century in modern-day Henan province, before an invasion by northern neighbours drove them out of the area.“It’s the romance of the lost capital of the Northern Song, moving miles south and having to build a new capital and never being able to have these precise, beautiful ceramics ever again, despite multiple attempts over many eras to recreate them,” said Ms Harrison-Hall.As well as the interesting history, the reattribution of the dish as Ru ware greatly increased its value.Ms Harrison-Hall said: “It changes from being about £5,000 to being £15 million.”The dish is on display with the rest of the Sir Percival David collection in Room 95 of the British Museum.More from NewsWhat will the monarchy look like when Prince Charles becomes king?Politics latest news: Winter lockdown ruled out by minister despite his \u0026#39concerns\u0026#39 over slow booster rollout\u0026#39To retrofit them only works under certain circumstances\u0026#39: Readers on the rush to heat pumpsWhat is the Government’s Plan B?

To an audience of community leaders, anti-poverty campaigners and environmental groups, he began arrestingly: “Dear social poets… that is what I like to call you: social poets. You are social poets because you have the ability and the courage to create hope where there appears to be only waste and exclusion.”He went on to attack social media companies for encouraging “hate speech, grooming, fake news” and to condemn agribusiness and mining for destroying habitats. He then called for a basic income and shorter working hours… And that wasn’t even the half of it.When the 84-year-old Jesuit Pope gets the bit between his teeth, he can be very good value, a genuine populist. He is much less of an intellectual than his predecessor, Pope Benedict, but he gets on the radar: after one visit to the EU, he left in a battered old Fiat. It’s a real pity that he isn’t attending the climate conference in Glasgow, because he would have lambasted all the global leaders there for inaction and we could have had another picture of him and Greta Thunberg together – the last one was in 2019 – beaming.He is popular with many younger Catholics. In a survey last year by Stephen Bullivant and Ben Clements, 55 per cent of young Catholics in Britain (especially mass-goers) thought he was a change for the better for the papacy. My daughter, 14, says that her age cohort likes him. “He’s liberal, “she says. “And he interacts with you.”But while he can reach parts few other modern Popes reach, he is still a isive figure within the Church, of which he is head.Not to put too fine a point upon it, lots of Catholics can’t stand him – liberals, as well as Conservatives. This week, in a riveting piece for The Spectator website headlined “Is the Pope a Protestant?”, Damian Thompson argues that you could indeed say the Pope has “gone Protestant”. He says: “Francis may be pursuing a liberal policy agenda, but it’s also quirky and incoherent. He is Jesuitical in the pejorative sense of the term, constantly shifting his position in order to keep both his opponents and supporters on their toes. But his leadership has none of the positive attributes of his order: it has created an intellectual mess.”This is strong stuff, though not half as strong as a priest he quotes, who expressed the hope that the Pope would drop dead that very night. Francis himself intimated that there are people who’d like to see him off. After his colon operation in July, someone asked him how he was. “Still alive,” he replied, “though some people want me to die.” If you’re Pope, being paranoid doesn’t mean people aren’t out to get you.The groups he most often sees as the enemy are conservatives hostile to his approach. And he doesn’t pull his punches with them. Though he didn’t mention them by name, he referred to America’s biggest religious broadcaster, EWTN, recently as “the work of the devil”. They speak well of him, too.He’s especially combative towards “backward-looking” critics of his new direction for the Church – towards a synodal structure in which grassroots parishioners have a say in how the Church is run. We’ll see how that turns out.Most of the people who are uneasy with the direction of the papacy are indeed conservatives. But some are liberals, like the former Irish president, Mary McAleese, who declared earlier this year that she was unimpressed by the Pope whose “chummy words to the press often quite reasonably raise hopes of church reform which are subsequently almost invariably dashed by firm restatements of unchanged church teaching”. He raises hopes, but “he is the Pope who toes the old hard line”.McAleese’s particular preoccupation is gay rights. On this and on the question of whether orced and remarried people can receive communion, the Pope can give off mixed messages. He’s undoubtedly genuinely anxious to be receptive and welcoming to gay people in the Church, but he’s never blessed same-sex unions or suggested that the Church could do so. As for giving communion to people who would be traditionally considered to be living in adultery – those who remarry while their previous spouse is alive – he has told bishops and priests to be “pastoral” and consider the people in front of them. Is that yes or no?And what about politicians who vote to make abortion accessible, including late-term abortions? Can they receive communion? On the actual issue, Francis is unequivocal. “Abortion is homicide,” he declared to journalists recently, which is clear. But then he went on to declare that, as a priest, he had never refused communion to anyone, which isn’t much use to US bishops who must decide what to do when pro-choice Joe Biden pitches up for communion. He talks tough on abortion, but then gives a warm reception to pro-abortion Nancy Pelosi when she came to the Vatican.As for the really terrible succession of scandals around child abuse by members of the Church, most recently in France, Francis is as shocked as anyone. Asked for his reaction to the report on abuse in France, he said simply: “Shame.” And yet it took forever for his commission dealing with the issue to reach conclusions and for them to be put into effect. He is a reformer who often seems to lack the organisational drive to see his reforms through.But it would be unfair just to focus on negatives. The Pope is eloquent and genuinely committed to environmental issues his encyclical, Laudato Si’, was an attempt to explore how people can be stewards of creation. On giving admission to migrants, he’s liberal, probably more liberal than many Catholic congregations. And when it comes to the position of women, no one has appointed more women to senior positions within the Church, ever, including important areas, like finance and governance, though he has not gone in the direction of women’s ordination as priests and bishops. The paradox of the pope is that he is reformist and liberal, and yet, when it comes down to it, supportive of tradition because he has to be the Pope may be a Protestant in some ways, but he is still a Catholic.But has he actually done anything to broaden the appeal of the Church in a secular culture? Professor Stephen Bullivant, a sociologist at St Mary’s University, observes: “If you ask people why they like him, then you often discover that they – paradoxically – see him as beingembodying everything that they think the Catholic Church isn’t – ie, they see him as a pro-science, pro-LGBTQ, pro-environment, religious and moral relativist. The trouble is, of course, that those general impressions aren’t terribly accurate either of Francis or the Church.“This means two things. Firstly, that people’s attraction to (their construction of) Pope Francis doesn’t end up making them any more attracted to the Catholic Church. And secondly, they end up constantly being disappointed by things Pope Francis actually does or says. (My favourite example of this whole phenomenon is a Rolling Stone article, ‘Guess the Cool Pope Isn’t So Cool After All’).”Another paradox of the Pope is that he may be liberal, but he’s a liberal authoritarian. This was particularly evident in his crackdown on those who attend mass celebrated according to the so-called Tridentine rite, which was the norm before the Second Vatican Council. Here, nice Pope Francis showed his SS side, in obliging congregations who wanted to hear mass in the old rite to get permission from their bishops and newly ordained priests to obtain permission from the Vatican. Trouble is, those congregations include many families and young people.He’s complicated, then, Pope Francis – but he inspires enormous loyalty. Eamon Duffy, the historian whose book on the papacy, Saints and Sinners (Yale University Press), stops before Francis, says simply that “he’s the Pope I’ve been waiting for my entire life”. And by the looks of things, Francis hasn’t run out of steam.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Winter lockdown ruled out by minister despite his \u0026#39concerns\u0026#39 over slow booster rollout\u0026#39To retrofit them only works under certain circumstances\u0026#39: Readers on the rush to heat pumpsWhat is the Government’s Plan B?

They\u0027ve got to, I think, be respectful towards other people, they\u0027ve got to keep themselves safe and the public as well.The NHS Confederation\u0027s warning comes as coronavirus deaths in the UK rose to their highest daily level since early March, while cases are at their highest for almost three months.Downing Street said it was keeping a very close eye on rising case rates, but added the Prime Minister has absolutely no plan to introduce Plan B, which could also involve introducing vaccine passports for nightclub entry.The NHS Confederation is the membership organisation that brings together, supports and speaks for the whole healthcare system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.Mr Taylor said the NHS is preparing for what could be the most challenging winter on record and urged the public to show extra support for the NHS by behaving in ways that will keep themselves and others safe.He added: It is time for the Government to enact Plan B of its strategy without delay because without pre-emptive action, we risk stumbling into a winter crisis.Also, health leaders need to understand what a \u0027Plan C\u0027 would entail if these measures are insufficient.The Government should not wait for Covid infections to rocket and for NHS pressures to be sky high before the panic alarm is sounded.Mr Taylor said if the Government fails to get a grip on rising coronavirus cases, the nation\u0027s recovery from the pandemic could be put at risk.On Tuesday, the Government said a further 223 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 - bringing the UK total to 138,852.While the numbers are often higher on Tuesdays because of a lag in reporting deaths and cases over the weekend, this is the highest figure for daily reported deaths since March 9.Meanwhile, the seven-day average for cases is standing at 44,145 cases per day - the highest level for almost three months.The Prime Minister\u0027s official spokesman has previously said Plan B would only be used if there was a significant risk of the NHS being overwhelmed.The spokesman said: There are a number of different factors that would play into that decision.Largely it would be required when there was a significant risk of the NHS being overwhelmed.We are not at that point. Because of the vaccination programme, the levels we are seeing in both patients admitted to hospital and deaths are far lower than we saw in previous peaks.On Tuesday, Professor Neil Ferguson, a leading member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said he thinks Plan B could be implemented in England this winter, but it is unlikely we\u0027ll ever get close to the lockdown the country experienced in January.He added that the UK is no longer in the top rank of European countries in terms of overall vaccination coverage, particularly in vaccinating teenagers.The UK now has one of the highest weekly rates of new reported cases in the world.The weekly rate of new reported cases of Covid-19 in the UK has jumped from 367 cases per 100,000 people at the start of October to its current level of 463 per 100,000.By contrast, rates have dropped to very low levels in neighbouring countries such as Spain (24 per 100,000), France (48) and Germany (80).More from NewsWhat will the monarchy look like when Prince Charles becomes king?Politics latest news: Winter lockdown ruled out by minister despite his \u0026#39concerns\u0026#39 over slow booster rollout\u0026#39To retrofit them only works under certain circumstances\u0026#39: Readers on the rush to heat pumpsWhat is the Government’s Plan B?

Hospital admission numbers are still below levels seen last autumn, although they are rising gradually.According to Professor Neil Ferguson, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) from Imperial College London, there are “a number of reasons” why the UK currently has higher infection levels than many other European countries.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the professor suggested that the UK has “lower functional immunity in our population than most other western European countries” for a number of reasons.According to Professor Ferguson these reasons include the vaccine rollout starting earlier in the UK than elsewhere and the fact that “we relied more on the AstraZeneca vaccine”.There are other suggestions that less mask wearing, more relaxed rules around mixing and a slowing vaccine rollout could also be behind the surge in figures. But why exactly are cases of Covid rising in the UK?Waning immunity?The UK was one of the fastest countries in the world to rollout the Covid-19 vaccine, meaning that immunity of some of those who were first vaccinated may be lower now.A study of Covid test results of vaccinated people who logged their symptoms in an app, suggested that after about five or six months, the protection against catching the virus wanes significantly.Join our new commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesView  comments"},{"url":null,"title":"covid cases rising 323 uk","story":"Covid cases rising in  UK areas as top  locations with biggest increase namedBath  North East Somerset has the highest rate in the UK, with , new coronavirus cases in the seven days to October  - the equivalent of . per , peoplethis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video coronavirus-new-cases-deaths-october-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:QrlfFY,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Cameron Mitchell, , from Carlisle, suffers frequent seizures and muscle spasms and is fed through a tube, according to his law firm Leigh Day. But lawyers said his Personal Independence Payment, and his mothers’ Carer’s Allowance, were stopped because he spent  days in hospital to June. PIP benefit is worth up to £. a week to help with the costs of being disabled. But it is only paid for the first  days of a stay in a care home, hospital or prison. The Department for Work and Pensionsargues this is because the NHS is funding someone’s care during a long-term stay in hospital. But Cameron’s mother and carer Nicola Clulow is pursuing a High Court case on his behalf, saying the -day rule breaches human rights law on discrimination.  She argued that even though Cameron was in hospital, she still needed to provide essential care - including spotting when a seizure was imminent, communicating with him and helping him move around. She said his family lost more than £, in benefit payments over the period, despite having to spend £ a week on food and transport. Ms Clulow, whose case is backed by evidence from Mencap, Carers UK and Marie Curie, said: “We are requesting this review to the PIP  day hospitalisation rule on behalf of Cameron and many other adults just like him, who due to complex and multiple profound learning disabilities, cannot have all of their needs met by the NHS while in hospital. “Cameron requires the constant care and knowledge of his needs from a known carer whenever he is hospital. “This doesnapost change on day , but the financial means to enable us to provide this support does.”From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times.

Lawyers first sent a pre-action letter to the Department for Work and Pensionsin July. But in September the DWP ruled they would not make an exception. Cameron’s mother has now decided to request a judicial review - where judges could declare the entire policy unlawful. Leigh Day solicitor Carolin Ott said: “As a result of Cameron’s profound and multiple learning disabilities, he cannot be effectively cared for without assistance from his known carers, his parents. “A one-size-fits-all approach does not work for patients like Cameron. “It is crucial that severely disabled patients’ complex needs are taken into account throughout their hospital or hospice stay, and not disregarded after  days.” Comment MORE ON Department for Work and PensionsCameron MitchellNHSHospitalsCare homesCourt caseHuman rightsNursing homes\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

NHS Confederation boss Matthew Taylor, which represents the healthcare systems in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, said the new curbs were needed or the UK would risk stumbling into a winter crisis. It comes after deaths from Covid peaked at  - the highest seen for months - while the seven-day average for Covid- cases stands at , a day. The government has warned that working from home and vaccine passports could be introducedthe NHS is at risk of being overwhelmed. But Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng ruled out imposing another lockdown - and even told Brits to go ahead with planning Christmas parties.  Mr Taylor said action needs to brought in now or it will derail efforts to tackle the backlog of five million patients waiting for treatment. He said: We are right on the edge – and it is the middle of October. It would require an incredible amount of luck for us not to find ourselves in the midst of a profound crisis over the next three months.  The government ought to not just announce that we’re moving to Plan B, but it should be Plan B plus. We should do what’s in Plan B in terms of masks… working from home, but also we should try to achieve the kind of national mobilisation that we achieved in the first and second waves, where the public went out of their way to support and help the health service. As he urged people to avoid risky behaviour, Mr Taylor said inaction would lead to a really profound crisis in the health and social care through the winter. No said it was keeping a very close eye on rising case rates, but added the Prime Minister has absolutely no plan to introduce Plan B of its winter plan. Mr Kwarteng insisted that another lockdown would not be imposed. No, I would rule that out, he told Sky News. Throughout this process, thereaposve been people saying the lockdown was unnecessary, there have been other people saying we should continue the lockdown. Weaposve really plotted a path between those two extremes. But he said it was a good thing for people to wear masks in public places.  I think people should do what they feel is the right thing to do, he said. Theyaposve got to, I think, be respectful towards other people, theyaposve got to keep themselves safe and the public as well. Mr Kwarteng also struck an optimistic note when he told Brits it was absolutely worth it to pay a deposit on a Christmas party. Asked on Times Radio whether it was wise to pay money towards a party, he said: Absolutely. I think I already have, weaposve got some arrangements in place and I look forward to having a Christmas party as usual. Meanwhile, one of the architects behind the first lockdowns has warned restrictions may need to be brought back in. Professor Neil Ferguson, a member of the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesfrom Imperial College London, said Covid hospitalisations are doubling every five weeks as immunity wanes. Just . million of the . million at-risk people who had their second jab at least six months ago have had their third dose, and the gap is growing. Professor Ferguson said: “I don’t think we’re looking at another lockdown... the worst case here are demands on the NHS... it’s very unlikely we’ll see anything like the levels of deaths we saw last year, for instance. “Coming into the winter, there may be a Plan B which needs to be implemented, which involves some rolling back of measures, but I doubt that we’ll ever get close to lockdown we were in January of this year.” He added: “I don’t think it’s a reason to panic right now but I would certainly like to see vaccination booster doses accelerated, vaccination for teenagers accelerated.” Comment MORE ON NHSCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

So many of us WhatsApp, email, Facebook or tweet, tapping away in a cess pit with a race to the bottom in terms of our discourse. The empathy has gone. The respect for peers and authority, a staple of older generations, is a thing of the past. It won’twith screens between MPs and their constituents or police officers on the doors of surgeries. They are the ideas of a regime with a left hand over its eyes and their right hand feeling around in the dark. Complacency will eventually replace the concern to be seen to be doing something anyway after the killing of Sir David Amess and, heartbreakingly, we will be back here in a few years’ time - just as after Jo Cox in , Stephen Timms in  and Nigel Jones in .We are all at risk from an atmosphere that threatens to consume us, never mind extremists. My jaw hit the floor when we heard that the inidual held in connection with the death threat sent to MP Chris Bryant is  years of age. I remember, as we neared the end of the last lockdown, hearing friends’ fears that things could explode after it was lted with so many people having spent so long shouting at each other online.  Don’t kid yourself that the trolls are teenagers or twenty-somethings still living at home and eating cornflakes way past lunchtime in their pyjamas. Many wear suits and ties, carry laptops and enjoy top jobs with big s. None see any problem hammering politicians on all sides or the likes of Meghan Markle. Even the debate about finally cracking down on hate speech online is quite something when ordinary people, footballers, celebrities and other politicians have been begging for it for years now without success. Ask the likes of Diane Abbott and Dawn Butler.  Justice Secretary Dominic Raab and MPs such as Bernard Jenkin and Mark Francois are among those now urging us all to be kinder.Tell that to Boris Johnson and Priti Patel, both called out by England footballer Tyrone Mings for refusing to condemn those booing our national team for taking the knee. This is the least kind government in living memory.A government that wants to hand immunity to people causing others to drown in the English Channel. A government whose ministers belted out karaoke tunes at their party conference earlier this month on the day they cut Universal Credit for millions.  A government whose hostile environment campaign has seen lives lost and millions of families devastated. A government whose Prime Minister was given the chance to dial down his racially offensive rhetoric about Muslim women and black people and chose instead to double down. When MP Paula Sherrf complained in parliament in  of the abuse and harassment she and other female MPs were being subjected to, Johnson suggested “the best way to ensure that every parliamentarian is properly safe and [to] dial down the current anxiety…[was] to get Brexit done”. None of that justies violence. Ever. What it underscores is our need for a period of introspection and the drawing of a line in the sand. It should never have taken the passing of a good man to spark that.

The part of it I particularly resented as a child was the weekends – my dad had already been gone all day and most evenings during the week at the House of Commons, and then every other weekend he’d disappear too  I moaned about it to him once. We had an easy, light-hearted ­relationship but I remember him being very serious when he replied to my whinge. “What I’m doing at weekends,” he told me, “is the most important part of my job.” What he was referring to was surgeries. Every other Friday evening and Saturday daytime, he made himself available to his constituents – they didn’t need an appointment, they could just walk in and talk about their problems. In the wake of the senseless killing of Sir David Amess there have been calls for MPs’ surgeries to end, or become virtual. But it would be piling disaster on top of tragedyeither of these things happen.MPs must be kept safe, for sure – but this face-to-face contact with the people they represent is essential. My dad was an MP for an area of Birmingham for  years, but before that he was briefly MP for the area where I grew up, where my mum still lives. It was one term,  years ago, and yet to this day I can’t walk down the high street there without being stopped by a stranger who will tell me about something my dad did for them. A way he helped, improved their lives, that they will never forget.  That process, whatever it went on to achieve, had always started because they came to talk to him at his surgery. My dad was right – it’s the most important part of an MP’s job. Working for the people who voted for them. Listening to those who feel they don’t have a voice. Helping anyone who feels helpless. My dad would regularly marvel at how much a letter on House Of Commons headed paper could quickly achieve, in situations that had been rattling on for years. Whatever your view of politicians, the simple truth is – rightly or wrongly – your MP’s involvement makes a dference.

He was one of the first to send my family a message of condolence when my dad died in . Of course my father would be horried by what happened to Sir David, and yet, I’m absolutely certain he would be devastated to think surgeries as he knew them would stop as a result. And – presumptuous though it may be – it’s tempting to suspect that David Amess might well have felt the same. He was a regular at the charity carol concert put on in his constituency each December, but according to one of the choir members, he missed the start of it every year. “He was always five minutes late,” remembers Jenner Stonestreet, “because he’d stopped to talk to someone on the way.” Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON David AmessParliamentPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Nottinghamshire Police have recorded a surge in cases in recent months and are stepping up operations to tackle the problem. “These are obviously vile crimes,” said Commons Home Affairs Select Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper. Ms Cooper, a former Shadow Home Secretary, told the committee she received a report today from a victim who attended a hospital casualty unit last night “as a result of a possible injection spiking”. The victim “referred to their being three other people who were in the AE at the same time for spiking more widely, who were unable to walk as a result of drink spiking”. Ms Cooper said: “That seems to be a pretty signicant problem, at one AE in the country in one night.” She added: “This is incredibly dangerous, what people are doing - this is poisoning someone, potentially sexually assaulting someone, potentially people’s lives at risk. “There is obviously huge concern from young people that this is not being taken seriously - they are talking about boycotting nightclubs as a protest.” Avon and Somerset Police Chief Constable Sarah Crew, the National Police Chiefsapos Council spokeswoman for rape and adult sexual offences, insisted: “Police forces are absolutely taking it seriously.” But she admitted the first she knew of the latest claims was when reports surfaced in the media today. “In terms of the injection spiking, I only became aware of that this morning,” she told the committee. “From the reports that I have seen, at the moment I can see that a number of police forces are investigating them.“They haven’t been raised with me. I think it is a fair assumption there may be a sexual motive in those, but there isn’t an indication.”She added: “In terms of more general drinks spiking, we do know that’s a problem.”Ms Crew said officers were working with nightclub bosses and security chiefs to “work out who are the predators who are using that MO , to target and act upon it”. Hampshire Police and Crime Commissioner Donna Jones, the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners’ joint lead for supporting victims, said: “I do think the scale of the problem is more signicant than we realise because of the nature of the vulnerability of the victims it’s done to - often people that are engaging in alcohol anyway, and so they’re sketchy about what’s happening.” Nottinghamshire Police have seen a rising number of reports of spiking over recent months and are now stepping up operations to tackle the problem. Superintendent Kathryn Craner said: Over the last few months we have seen an increase in reports where people believe that drugs may have been put in their drink - thataposs due to the fact that they have experienced a distinctly dferent feeling to their normal reaction to alcohol.” Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Hampshire PoliceNottinghamshire PoliceAvon and Somerset PoliceYvette CooperHospitalsCrimeAlcohol\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

SAGE member Prof Neil Ferguson warned there may be a Plan B which needs to be implemented as we head into winter, with infections already hitting around , a day this week. This, Prof Ferguson said, would involve some rolling back of measures but not a full lockdown like UK saw in January.But coronavirus vaccine injections have stalled, there is concern at rising infections and fears over a new Delta Plus iant.So why do you need a booster jab, and what is holding up the rollout  Have your say on the booster rollout in the comment section  Here, Mirror Health and Science Editor Martin Bagot answers five key questions. Q Why do I need to be given a booster jab  A Studies show the protective immunity starts to wane substantially from around five months after the second dose.King’s College London found that the effectiveness of the AstraZeneca jab against catching the virus fell from % to % at four to five months after a second dose. Get the latest news direct to your inbox.to one of the Mirroraposs newslettersThe drop off for the Pfizer jab was slightly less at % to %. Effectiveness levels against serious illness are thought to last for a month or two longer. No vaccines offer % protection. Q Do I need oneI’ve already had Covid-  A Yes. While having had Covid in combination with having been vaccinated is thought to boost the immune response, it is no guarantee you are protected. It is still possible to spread the virus and have symptoms which risk turning in to Long Covid. Q When should I have a booster jab  A The Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation has recommended over-s get a booster six months after their second dose. NHS invitations for most should arrive a matter of days after this milestone. Despite this, around a third of eligible over-s are yet to have their top-up jab.Q Can I have the flu jab at the same time  A Yes. If NHS supplies locally and your Covid dose interval allows it then you can one jab in each arm during the same appointment. However the NHS has been instructed not to delay one jab so that both can be delivered together. Because of this most Brits will have Covid boosters and flu jabs in separate appointments. Q What is holding up rollout of booster jabs in the UK  A A combination of factors.Britain was later than most comparable countries in approving booster jabs so is playing catch up. Vaccinations could be made more convenient for the public to have. It is more complicated for the NHS to rollout booster jabs to a number of dferent groups while also administering jabs to school children. People appear have become more complacent about the threat posed by Covid- and are less urgent in arranging booster appointments than they were for initial doses.

The Government has left it to the last minute to set out how it will meet its net zero carbon target by , with days to go before the COP climate change summit in Glasgow. The Tories claim the UK will be a world leader on tackling climate change, but how does their plan stack up and is there a sting in the tail for you The PM says the UK is on course to build back greener from the Covid pandemic, but Labour has said that between pages of plans, strategies and hot air, there is still a chasm between the rhetoric and the reality.We weed out the hidden nasties buried in the Governmentaposs climate blueprint.  . We donapost know how much itaposll all cost Documents released by Rishi Sunakaposs Treasury fail to give a figure for the overall cost of reaching net zero by  would be - or the benefits. But critics are most worried about the scale of under-investment. The strategy so far includes £bn of investment in the next decade, most of it from the private sector, in what the Government claims will create , jobs.  But it estimates a staggering £bn of combined private and public investment will be needed between  and . While many hope more investment is in the pipeline, Shadow Environment Secretary Ed Miliband said the climate plan appears torpedoed by the Treasury and ministers have offered a tiny fraction of what is needed to meet the challenge. Labouraposs Rachel Reeves pledging to match-fund private sector investment with up to £bn-a-year of public funds. This would commit the party to spending £bn on climate measures over the next eight years.. More tax hikes and price rises on the cards Despite Boris Johnsonaposs manesto pledge not to raise taxes, the Government admits the task of the UKaposs transition to net zero, in the wake of Covid, means tax hikes cannot be avoided. The Treasury document spells it out in black and white: “Overall, a combination of tax, regulation, spending and other facilitative levers will be required, it says. Some new technologies needed for the switch to net zero - such as heat pumps - are signicantly more expensive, but the Government is pinning its hopes on prices falling as markets scale up. Treasury documents say that “as with all economic transitions, ultimately the costs and benefits of the transition will pass through to households through the labour market, prices and asset values”.  The review, published alongside the Government’s net zero strategy, said it was not possible to forecast how inidual household finances would be hit over the course of a -year transition to net zero greenhouse gas emissions. . A nuclear power plant not agreed for years The plan vows to “secure a final investment decision on a large-scale nuclear plant by the end of this Parliament”. That will mean a large-scale nuclear plant - possibly on the Sizewell site - is finally built anew in Britain. But nuclear plants take years to assemble, and the end of the Parliament could still be two and a half years away before work even begins. Meanwhile the plan vows to launch “a new £ million Future Nuclear Enabling Fund, retaining options for future nuclear technologies, including Small Modular Reactors, with a number of potential sites including Wylfa in North Wales.” . A decision on hydrogen heating not due until  The government has set the “ambition” that by , all new heating appliances will be low-carbon - like electric heat pumps or hydrogen boilers. But the first mainstream hydrogen boilers - where the gas is used in lieu of the current gas in the mains - won’t be up and running for years. A decision will only be made in , before a “gradual transition that works with the grain of consumer choice”. This means pleas to change the system urgently may fall on deaf ears. . Only £bn for cycling The plan commits £bn for cycling - which in the grand scheme of government spending is not the most earth-shattering sum.  By comparison, the government pledged £bn for “bus services and cycling routes” over the five years from . The plan promises “first hundreds, then thousands of miles” of segregated cycle lanes and at least one zero-emission transport city. . No plan to cut meat consumption The global production of meat - such as beef, chicken and pork - is causing deforestation and accounts for around a third of all planet-heating gases. The landmark Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changereport made clear governments should encourage people to eat less meat. “We don’t want to tell people what to eat,” Hans-Otto Pörtner, IPCC ecologist said. “But it would indeed be beneficial, for both climate and human health,people in many rich countries consumed less meat, andpolitics would create appropriate incentives to that effect.”  But while the Toriesapos strategy supports new nuclear plans and carbon capture projects, it is utterly silent on cutting emissions from livestock and freeing up land for planting trees. . Burden could fall on the poor Treasury documents urge that policies do not pile the economic pain onto the poor - but admit it is a risk. It reads: “As with all economic transitions, ultimately, the costs and benefits of the transition will pass through to households through the labour market, prices and asset values. These costs and benefits will not fall evenly across households.” But businesses and power-holders are warned seeking to pass the costs onto future taxpayers through borrowing would deviate from the apospolluter paysapos principle, would not be consistent with intergenerational fairness nor fiscal sustainability, and could blunt incentives. . Sht from fossil fuels to blow £bn black hole in UKaposs Budget Moving away from polluting gas and petrols means fuel duty and vehicle excise duty naturally disappear - but the Treasury has warned the lost revenue spells other taxes. No says the cost of net-zero will place “a signicant and permanent fiscal pressure not offset by the temporary measures like carbon pricing.It adds: This principally concerns revenues from Fuel Duty and Vehicle Excise Duty, amounting to £bn in   – equivalent to .% of GDP. Were the current tax system to remain unchanged across the transition period, tax receipts from most fossil fuel related activity will decline towards zero during the first  years of the transition, leaving receipts lower in the s by up to .%. HM Revenue and Customs could raise an extra .% of GDP, the Treasury estimates, with a new carbon tax but it would not close the gap left behind by old fossil fuel taxes. . Your mortgage could get more expensive Ministers are weighing up plans to link mortgages to green home improvements by imposing targets for lenders. The radical reform of the housing market would aim to nudge people to fork out to decarbonise older homes, such as large townhouses or family homes. But the drive could pile costs onto poorer families who may struggle to afford the necessary upgrades to get a cheaper mortgage.  Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “The problem is that while some properties can be improved at relatively little cost, other homeowners will find it prohibitively expensive. They may not be able to afford to borrow more, or the cost of changes to older properties may be disproportionately high, so they’d never recoup the cost of the improvements through a sale.” She said that while lower energy bills may offset some people’s costs, “the problem is that while some properties can be improved at relatively little cost, other homeowners will find it prohibitively expensive”. She added: “They may not be able to afford to borrow more, or the cost of changes to older properties may be disproportionately high, so they’d never recoup the cost of the improvements through a sale.” . Government backed out of scrapping diesel cars and gas boilers The Government has banned the sale of any new petrol and diesel car from  and any hybrid car from . But it has stepped back from ordering petrol and diesel cars will be scrapped. “We will work with the grain of consumer choice: no one will be required to rip out their existing boiler or scrap their current car, the net zero strategy reads. Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan also said getting rid of gas boilers would be voluntary as ministers hoped the market would drive change.  “In the short term, yes, of course this is a voluntary scheme … There will be a point at which that changes but, yes, for now that’s the case,” she told Sky News. The international trade secretary said she believed the market would eventually change to make the greener switch more affordable. “At the moment we’re encouraging the market to drive those changes,” she told the BBC. . People buying second-hand electric cars may be saddled with loans The Treasury cannot predict what the second-hand electric car market will look like given that it is a new market. Poorer households are more likely to buy second-hand, but government documents note interest rates in second-hand car finance arrangements are typically signicantly than for new cars. They add access to finance may become increasingly important, suggesting ministers fears lower-income motorists could end up saddled with debt in order to replace their petrol or diesel car. . Failing to act will be MUCH worse Buried in the document is the admission that the costs of reaching net zero - excluding air quality and emissions benefits - will be -% of the UK’s entire GDP in . And despite relatively little investment put forward, the Treasury admits that the UK economy will not escape catastrophecountries do not hit net zero targets. The Office for Budget Responsibility’s recent report showed unmitigated climate change resulting in “debt spiralling up to around % of GDP thanks to the cost of adapting to an ever hotter climate and of more frequent and more costly economic shocks”. The Treasury also cites ” damage to global supply chains affecting trade, reduced production in trading partner nations pushing up the cost of imported goods, and changes to migration. “The true cost of a warmer climate to the UK economy could be higher than current estimates,” it admits.

Ian Wright warned rising inflation could soon outstrip the woes caused by supply shortages - and hard-up families will be hit the worst. New data today showed yearly CPI inflation is .%, a slight fall from .% last month. But experts fear it could surge further this winter. But that is still almost the highest in a decade, and Mr Wright told MPs it is much higher in hospitality - which is a “precursor” to prices in shops and supermarkets. He told the Commons Business Committee: “In hospitality, which is a precursor of retail, inflation is running somewhere between  and %. “That is terrying.” The CPIH inflation index for hotels, motels and inns skyrocketed from . in September  to . in August . It has since reduced to .. The index for restaurants and cafes rose from . in September  to . in August . It is now .. Mr Wright told MPs: “Now I think I’m probably the oldest person in the room. I was at university in  - I remember inflation going to % under the Callaghan government. “And I remember the lady going round Sainsbury’s I think with stickers twice in the same hour to change the prices again and again. “We really cannot go back to that. It took us  years to recover from that. And it’s terrying for us and everybody who is suffering. If the prime minister is, as I know he is, serious about levelling up, inflation is a bigger scourge than almost anything , because it discriminates against the poor.”It came as industry bosses warned the committee supplies of food and goods could be hit for up to a year, as the UKaposs lorry driver shortage would take months to recover from. The haulage and food sectors claimed the situation on the ground was not visibly getting better heightening fears of supply issues in the run-up to Christmas. Families have already been warned there could be shortages of childrenaposs toys, turkey, Christmas trees and even Quality Street this year. Shops have started selling Christmas stock even though the festive period is more than two months away. The Road Haulage Associationaposs Duncan Buchanan told MPs on the business select committee: Things are very challenged at the moment. There are widespread shortages of lorry drivers, which are leading delays and frustrated trips. Among our members we are still getting reports that this hasnapost eased at all. Things are not visibly getting better at this stage. The RHA has previously warned that the UK faces a shortage of up to , lorry drivers. Mr Buchanan welcomed measures to address recruitment issues but warned they were not having an immediate effect just yet. Asked by committee chair Darren Jones how long it would take for the benefits to be felt, he replied: We think itaposs going to be a year to recover from where we are at the moment. Figures revealed by the Office for National Statistics show that driver numbers have plunged by , over the past four years. This is largely driven by retiring drivers not being replaced fast enough by new recruits.

Welsh nationalists Plaid Cymru will call on the Prime Minister to give Cardf Bay responsibility for the nation’s Crown Estate land - meaning it can reap the benefits when energy firms build wind farms off the coast. Plaid’s Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts is expected to issue the demand when she tackles the Conservative premier at Prime Minister’s Questions at noon. She will highlight next month’s COP climate summit in Glasgow as the ideal catalyst for an announcement. Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter “While the UK and Scottish Government reap the benefits of a green gold rush, Wales is missing out,” she told the Mirror. “COP must put people at the heart of our net zero mission. “But currently, the people of Wales are losing out on the clean energy revolution while Westminster reaps the benefits. “Today I will call on the Prime Minister to support my Crown Estate Devolution Bill, which will ensure that profits from our natural resources go to the people of Wales, not Westminster.” The Crown Estate, which manages land on behalf of the Queen, owns the seabed to a distance of  nautical miles off the coast.  It leases seabeds for offshore wind developments to generate renewable energy and pump funds into the Treasury. The Crown Estate pays its profits to the Treasury, which normally hands % to Buckingham Palace through the Sovereign Grant. In February, the Crown Estate announced six proposed new offshore wind projects in the waters around England and Wales, including one north east of Anglesey. The , megawatt wind farm could power nearly . million homes and potentially cut carbon emissions by .m tonnes. The Crown Estate’s five-page “Wales Highlights  ” document says: “As a result of Offshore Wind Leasing Round  the valuation of our marine portfolio in Wales has increased signicantly in the year from £. million to £. million.” Ms Saville Roberts wants that money to go to Wales.  She said: “For too long, the UKaposs economy has left people behind while wealth and investment has been concentrated in the South East of England. “Our clean energy revolution must not continue to leave Wales out in the cold. “Devolving powers over the Crown Estate would bring half a billion pounds of green assets under Welsh control. “This will help ensure that it is the people of Wales who benefit from this historic opportunity to create a greener future. “Much will be said about ‘levelling up’ in the coming weeksthat is to mean anything, the people of Wales must be equipped to manage our offshore wind and tidal resources for everyone’s benefit.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON The TreasuryCrown EstateThe CrownPoliticsGoldRenewable ResourcesPlaid Cymru\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Some , cases were recorded yesterday - up % in a week. Deaths have risen % to  in a week while weekly hospitalisations are up % to ,. SAGE member Prof Neil Ferguson, an architect of lockdown, warned: “Coming into the winter, there may be a Plan B which needs to be implemented, which involves some rolling back of measures. But I doubt that we’ll ever get close to lockdown we were in January of this year.” Plan A includes booster jabs for the over-s and other vulnerable groups, offering a first dose to  to -year-olds and advice to wear masks in enclosed spaces. But no one mentioned Plan B at today’s Cabinet meeting, and the Prime Minister told his ministers hospitalisations and deaths are “broadly flat”. “Although we face a dficult winter we have a plan in place to steer the country through this period,” the bullish Tory leader claimed.Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter - and join the debate in the comments below. At the same time, however, the government has today announced kids aged  to  will be able to get their Covid vaccines from walk-in centres rather than just in school. There are fears the rollout is too slow. As of October , .million under-s had received their first dose in England, out of an estimated .million people aged  to . Andthe rising case numbers aren’t turned around, No is not ruling out Plan B. “We’ve started to see some indications that hospitalisations and death rates are increasing,” the PM’s spokesman said. “Clearly we’re keeping a very close eye on rising case rates.” We don’t know when Plan B would be introduced - or whether it could happen before Christmas. In the words of No, “we would only look to use thatthe pressure on the NHS was looking to become unsustainable.” But we do know a bit about what it would involve and what factors would be used to trigger it. We also know it would apply to England, not Scotland or Wales. Here’s what you need to know.Mandatory masks- including in schoolsMinisters axed the legal requirement to wear face coverings in crowded and enclosed spaces in July. Instead they are a ‘condition of carriage’ on some transport - a weaker set of rules. But compulsory masks for places like shops and public transport - and fines from police - could the Covid situation deteriorates. The -page Autumn and Winter Plan states: If Plan B is implemented, the Government will bring back the legal requirement to wear face coverings in some settings. The precise settings will be decided at the time. Separately, schools have been handed a “contingency framework” for what to dothe virus surges, and a key plank is ing to compulsory masks in secondary classrooms. Scotland has already done this, and announced masks will continue after October half-term. Schools in England could also have to separate pupils back into ‘bubbles’ - though not with whole-class isolationone child gets sick - and must maintain regular cleaning and ventilation. Mandatory vaccine passports for venuesAfter a string of Tory U-turns over vaccine passports, they are now firmly in reserve for Plan B - and could be activated at a week’s notice. Currently venues are ‘encouraged’ to ask for NHS Covid passes, which allow punters to present proof of a vaccine or recent negative test, but hardly any venues are doing it. Under Plan B, certain venues would be forced to ask punters for an NHS Covid pass - and only the vaccine part would be valid. People would no longer be able to show a negative test. A consultation is under way about which venues would have to roll out the scheme. But in draft plans they include all nightclubs, and other venues open after am with alcohol, music, and dancing. They also include:Indoor, crowded settings with  or more attendees where those attendees are likely to be in close proximity to people from other households, such as music venues or large receptions. Outdoor, crowded settings with , or more attendees where those attendees are likely to be in close proximity to people from other households, such as outdoor festivals. Any settings with , or more attendees, such as large sports and music stadia.Working from homeUnder plan B the government “would consider asking people to work from homethey can, for a limited period”. But this is a long way from a lockdown-style order to WFH - and it looks almost like a Plan C. That is despite government advisors pointing out it drastically reduces the numbers of people mixing in offices and on public transport. The document states: The Government recognises this causes more disruption and has greater immediate costs to the economy and some businesses than the other Plan B interventions, so a final decision would be made based on the data at the time.  ‘Clear communications’This is where Plan B gets even vaguer. It says the government would ensure it “communicates clearly and urgently to the public that the level of risk has increased, and with it the need to behave more cautiously.” It adds: “In a Plan B scenario, the Government would issue clear guidance and communications to the public and businesses, setting out the steps that they should take to manage the increased risks of the virus.” Cases are at , a day, but we’ve not yet heard any fresh communications in recent days.From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times.

What would trigger Plan B Key questions the government would ask include: Is the NHS in danger of being overwhelmed  This crucially isn’t just about cases - hospitalisations and deaths are more important. Key metrics include “hospital occupancy for COVID- and non-COVID- patients, intensive care unitcapacity, admissions in vaccinated iniduals, and the rate of growth of admissions. The link between hospitalisation and infections: The winter plan says the Government is monitoring the ratio of cases to hospitalisations and also the proportion of admissions due to infections among other factors. It also states ministers are keeping an eye on how many people over -years-old are catching Covid- or ending up in hospital. Vaccine efficacy and immunity: A major booster campaign for the over-s and the most vulnerable started in September, but there are some calls for it to be stepped up. Crucial will be whether immunity across the population is waning, or whether it’s being kept strong by the booster programme. The impact of new iants: In recent months the threat of a new, more deadly or more infectious iant appears to have faded. But that doesn’t mean it won’t emerge in future months, and the government now has a sequencing infrastructure that will attempt to spot them as they appear.Could it go further Yes. Some have warned the Plan B measures above are pretty minimal overall. In particular,cases rise too high, you might need much stricter measures to actually bring cases down, rather than keep them stable or rising more slowly. The Plan B document says: “While the Government expects that, with strong engagement from the public and businesses, these contingency measures should be sufficient to reverse a resurgence in autumn or winter, the nature of the virus means it is not possible to give guarantees. “The Government remains committed to taking whatever action is necessary to protect the NHS from being overwhelmed but more harmful economic and social restrictions would only be considered as a last resort.” Comment MORE ON CabinetConservative PartyNHSBoris JohnsonEducationHospitalsSchoolsPublic transportPoliticsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He was recently diagnosed as having Irlen Syndrome, which causes dficulties with fine vision tasks such as reading and can also cause co-ordination problems. James was diagnosed as being on the autistic spectrum when he was just three-and-a-half years old, his mum Kirsty said.Myself and my husband noticed there was something niggly at two years old, but we werenapost sureit was because we were looking into it too much orit was genuinely something, Kirsty told YorkshireLive . But one of the nurses at Jamesapos two-year health check agreed that there could be something worth investigating and he was officially diagnosed as being on the autistic spectrum  months later. Around the same time as he was given that diagnosis, Jamesaposs parents were told that it was likely he had a form of ADHD - attention deficit hyperactivity disorder - but it was not until James was seven that he was formally diagnosed with autism.

And it gives us the ability to have the answershe does ask, heaposs not so far buthe does ask us aposwhy am I thinking dferently apos we can tell him. James was also more recently diagnosed as having Irlen Syndrome. Kirsty explained: He always struggled to read from a young age and we couldnapost grasp why. It wasnapost until one day I said to him aposyouaposre struggling to read, I donapost understand whyapos and he said aposbut the letters are moving everywhereapos and I was like aposWHAT !apos We just took him for an eye test and went with it, whenever something has cropped up we have just thought aposright lets see whataposs going on here thenapos. Luckily, Jamesaposs optician was able to kit him out with some special tinted glasses which help him to focus on the letters when he is reading - a similar fix to using coloured paper for dyslexia. Itaposs very much along the dyslexia lines, but I didnapost have a clue about it when I took him for the test, Kirsty said. For James, socialising with his peers is what he struggles with the most and there are times where it can be dficult for him to relate to his friends. James does not enjoy taking part in Christmas plays or concerts, unlike his school friends who relish the excitement of these festive celebrations. But there has been one thing that helped James to conquer this - his trusty drum kit. Kirsty said: Heaposs not a stage person, so Christmas concerts and stuff like that he doesnapost enjoy but, with this, he will actually get up and sit and play his drums. This remarkable turnaround is thanks to the local arm of a national music school, which has allowed James to get involved in his very own School of Rock and enjoy playing in a band with other children his age. Rocksteady, the countryaposs largest independent music school for children aged  -, went to Jamesaposs school to do some taster music lessons. He had the opportunity to sign up for more lessonshe liked them and the rest is history. After that he just enjoyed it and he carried on going and heaposs been going for years, Kirsty said, adding that it has made a world of dference not just to Jamesaposs social skills but his confidence, too. She continued: I think itaposs that thing where he can just be in the moment of the drums. Rocksteady is like a bit of a band and itaposs almost like heaposs in a band with people that he usually wouldnapost be in a band with, so heaposs talking to people he wouldnapost usually talk to. Kirsty and her husband have never allowed Jamesaposs diagnoses to stop him from having the same opportunities as other children and have always encouraged him to do aposeverydayapos tasks, despite these being a challenge at times. Kirsty said: I donapost think he particularly understands it yet and I think as he gets older he will, but he never refers to himself as being dferent. Weaposve always pushed to make him do things that everyone  does and things other kids would be doing.

The court, where the trial is ongoing, had previously heard that Arthur Labinjo-Hughes, , was once recorded sobbing: “No one loves me.” Birmingham City fan Arthur was found unresponsive at a home in Cranmore Road, Birmingham, on June  last year, Birmingham Live reported . He would die the following day at Birmingham Children’s Hospital. A post-mortem examination confirmed his death was caused by a head injury. Arthur’s father, Thomas Hughes, , and Emma Tustin, , were subsequently arrested in connection with his death.  They have both pleaded not guilty to murder and Tustin has admitted to one count of child cruelty but denied further charges of the same offence. Hughes also denied child cruelty offences. The trial is being held at Coventry Crown Court and recordings of Arthur crying and calling for his nanny and uncle have been played. Yesterday, October , medical expert Professor Stavros Stios was called to give evidence. He said The bleeding I saw in Arthuraposs case was in multiple dferent sites relating to his brain In Arthuraposs case the appearance of bleeding is more in keeping with shaking than impact. Today, October , Dr Roger Malcomson, consultant paediatric and perinatal pathologist, was called to give evidence on some of the injuries suffered by Arthur. He spoke about how Arthur’s thymus, an organ in the immune system in the chest, had shrunk severely. Dr Malcomson said this could have been the result of “repeated and sustained abuse”. He also said the pattern of bruising on the six-year-old’s body was “consistent with inflicted injuries.” Arthur also suffered from considerable bleeding within the eyes which led to the detachment of a retina and can be indicative of head trauma, the court was told.

Cllr Davies, the member for the Clewer East ward, said the man - who hasnapost been named - and his garden was apossplattered in a very unpleasant way.The resident said human waste was dropped from a plane passing overhead in Windsor, which is one of the main flight paths in and out of Heathrow Airport.Have you ever experienced anything like this  Get in touch at webnews@mirror He said it happened mid-July - when flights were still reduced amid the pandemic. Cllr Davies said: His whole garden and garden umbrellas, and he were all covered. Aeroplane toilets store passengersapos waste in special tanks and are normally emptied once the plane has landed. She told the forum: I know a number of incidents happen every year with frozen sewage from planes, but this wasnapost frozen and his whole garden was splattered in a very unpleasant way.  He was out in the garden at the time, so a really horrible, horrible experience. She added: Hopefully it never happens again to any of our residents.

He said: We used to have problems with blue iceon arrivals but that was because those toilets used to leak. He went on to explain that vacuum toilets in modern aircraft were much more secure. However,planes were below ,ft, as they would be when landing and taking off, the air pressure was less and it could well be that something came out of the vent at low altitude. Windsor resident Andrew Hall, who was present at the virtual meeting, said water companies were fined millions when discharging sewage into rivers. He added: When an aircraft dispatches it onto peopleaposs heads I think thataposs more heinous, frankly. Cllr Davies said the resident had decided not to pursue an insurance claim. The name of the airline has not been revealed though she said it was based a very long way away from here. She added that the resident contacted the airline, which denied its plane was in the area, but later confirmed it when the resident was able to identy the aircraft via a route tracking app. The Civil Aviation Authority has been contacted for comment.

Janice Cousins, , was hard at work in her garden when she decided to take a break and announced it was “gin o’clock”, and was initially confused when her eight-year-old black Labrador named Bear ran off into the kitchen. But her confusion turned to amusement when the pooch ed to the garden  seconds later with a pre-made can of Tanqueray gin and tonic nestled in his mouth. Janice, a retired postlady from Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, said: The command for Bear to pick anything up is his name. He wonapost normally go and collect anything until he hears that.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. On this occasion though he trotted off on aposgin oaposclockapos and grabbed me a can. It was amazing and very useful. Heaposs done it before with beer, cider and even bottles of wine. He’s a good lad. He works for biscuits so heaposs always willing to help out.” The woman said she and her husband Dave, , were interested in testing Bear’s skills while away from the main house – and they’re more than impressed with the pooch’s abilities.  She added: Iaposve trained Bear with gun dog training methods and once Iaposve shown him something - whether it be a log, his toy or even a bottle of wine - I can release him and command him to get that object. If there were  toys in one place and pointed to one specic one, he would get that for me. Heaposs a very bright cookie. Both Dave and I had been working hard in the garden - he was putting up lights and I was painting - and it was time for a little break.  I was away from the house and wanted to test Bearaposs skills and he delivered. I really did enjoy that gin, especially as I didnapost have to collect it myself. Janice - who has another chocolate Labrador called Benson - has been training Bear for several years, and said his skills came in handy a few years ago when she underwent a double hip replacement and couldn’t bend down. She explained: I had a double hip replacement a couple of years ago and I had to use a grabber to pick stuff up beforehand. I couldnapost bend before the operation so I taught him to fetch his own bowl and hand it up to me so I could feed him. It was hugely helpful at the time and Iaposve just continued his training. Weaposve got our own log burner and he will help fetch the logs for me.” And Janice is especially pleased at Bear’s progress as he wasnapost always so well behaved before going through his training regime. She said: He was a very naughty adolescent dog when he was younger, which is why I decided to go for gundog training. It turned his attitude right around.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON DogsAnimals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

However the -year-old has had the last laugh after making millions in software, construction and property firms. He now lives in a lavish mansion in Bretby, Derbyshire, and his le could not be more dferent from his early days on aposthe estateapos. Do you have a story youaposd like us to feature  Get in touch at webnews@mirrorThe dad of four said: I grew up in a village in Leicestershire called Thornton on what was referred to as aposthe estateapos - which was completely separate from the rest of the village in so many ways. You were from aposup the villageapos or aposdown the estateapos. A lot of people didnapost work and that was the environment I grew up in. There was violence too - people would beat each other up for no reason. I managed to get myself out of a lot of scrapes because I was a quick runner, but there were times when Iaposd get trapped and beaten up. I was always looking over my shoulder. Looking back, thataposs actually made me mentally sharp and aware.  Mark lived with his parents and three sisters - twins  years older than him and another seven years his senior. His dad, James - who tragically died following an illness in  - worked as a builder and a taxi driver. Mark, who now lives in a multi-million-pound property in Bretby, said: My sisters always looked after me, but when you donapost have much money, you have to rely on your siblingsapos hand-me-downs. Iaposd be wearing girlsapos jeans and trying to make them look like they were boysapos.  I even had to take on my sisteraposs pink trainers. I used bitumen from my dadaposs building site to make them black. One day, I remember I was playing football and it was wet, so the bitumen started coming off, revealing the pink colour beneath. The boys mocked me, shouting, aposYouaposre wearing girlsapos shoesapos. My mum used to scrimp and save every penny - going to the toilet in the dark to save electricity and washing disposable sandwich bags so they could be reused. Everything she saved, though, my dad would take to the pub and **** up the wall. Bad as it seemed at the time, these things were actually my inspirations - they made me realise I didnapost want to be worrying about whether somethingaposs p or p before I bought it.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter That meant I was always driven to make money. I was washing cars when I wasnapost big enough to lt the bucket and working on a building site with my dad in my teens. Mark now has more wealth than most people would ever dream of. He lives in a huge home with we Nikola, , and is father to daughters Freya, three Sienna-Rose, six and Courtney,  - as well as infant son Theo. And he says a key reason he has got to where he is today is the fact he always kept faith things would work out. He said: I always had a feeling inside there had to be more to le. Iaposd even put vouchers and Monopoly money in my pockets when I went out to have that feeling of having cash in my pockets. When I was , I decided to go it alone and start a construction business, but in , the global financial crash happened.  There was no work and it was incredibly tough being a self-employed -year-old - then Courtney came along and I just thought aposIaposve got to do somethingapos. I did everything I could to make money - even selling door to door - and ended up somehow getting a job with an IT company. I knew nothing about IT, but thataposs how I got into software, which is where it all began. Markaposs hard work began to pay off - he became the companyaposs leading salesman and was promoted to become head of sales. Then came an opportunity to become a partner in his ex-colleagueaposs software company. Mark said: That really was a game-changer for me. We did £. million of sales in  months, turning round what had been a struggling company losing money every month.  Thataposs where I started to get into training people and realised that business is people - when I helped others to become better versions of themselves, the company won. With his new-found wealth, Mark was able to invest in property and, from , within  months, he had established a portfolio worth £. million. Now, his property firm, Harvey Property Solutions, has done £ million of deals. The other side of Markaposs business world is his Real Le group, which has companies across sectors, including in construction and training. It also boasts a foundation training children how to deal with le issues, including building relationships and communication.  Mark says he wants to use the brand to help create a more harmonious civilization. He said: I like helping people to transform their lives. I wanted to create a business where staff want to help the business grow because it helps them. I want people to want to go to work. I grew up always hearing. aposOh no - itaposs Monday againapos. But in our property training ision, weaposve helped create  millionaires.  Not everyone has to be a believer, but they should know they can create a le where they are comfortable enough and have the resources to deal with it when things get really tough. If I can do it with some of the things Iaposve come up against, then many other people already have a head-start. Iaposm always drawn to people who need help and want to know whether they, deep down, want to help themselves.

But luckily Dec quickly corrected himself and laughed off the mistake by adding: Erm, from Her Royal Highness rather... Iaposve just promoted you there, rather prematurely. To soften the blow Ant added: That must happen all the time, as Dec continued: It doesnapost happen to me. Weaposll be hearing from Her Royal Highness, rather, very shortly. Then weaposll watch a very powerful short film that challenges the perception of addictions. For the event at the BAFTA headquarters on Londonaposs Piccadilly, Kate sported a long red pleated skirt with a matching red polo neck top. She teamed it with tan heels and a matching bag.

Click here to sign up .And in her keynote speech to launch the Taking Action on Addiction campaign, she warned how anybody could become an addict. She said: Addiction is not a choice. No one chooses to become an addict. But it can happen to any one of us. None of us are immune. Yet it’s all too rarely discussed as a serious mental health condition. And seldom do we take the time to uncover and fully understand its fundamental root causes. The journey towards addiction is often multi-layered and complex. But, by recognising what lies beneath addiction, we can help remove the taboo and shame that sadly surrounds it. As a society, we need to start from a position of compassion and empathy. Where we nurture those around us, understand their journey, and what has come before them.Meanwhile, beforehand in a candid chat with Ant, he opened up to Kate and told how his problems with alcohol and drug addiction were able to “disappear” after he opened up on his struggles to close friends.Kate told him and Dec: The more we speak to everybody, and actually some of the stories today, the feeling of a burden that we have to carry,a secret event. “And actually once you start sharing your stories, there are so many people who have either experienced it themselves or know someone who has gone through it. Ant replied: “I found that myself. “By the time I asked for help it was really, it was bad, but as soon as you opened up to people, problems have got to disappear and it gets better and help is there.” Comment MORE ON Ant McPartlinKate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgeRoyal FamilyDeclan Donnelly\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Some of the things experts suggest may help include: Never accept a drink from a stranger Use a drink stopperdrinking from a bottle If drinking from a glass, try to cover it with your hands But as Lela London writes forThe Independent,these measures can only do so much . She wrote: Rather than releasing posters suggesting aposone in three cases of rape happen when the victim has been drinkingapos, the government needs to conduct prevention campaigns focused on the illegality and immorality of drinks spiking itself. Rather than teaching young girls to cover their drinks and bodies defensively, we need to report and penalise culprits. The change starts in our culture, not in our caution.How to help a friend who you think has been spiked: Tell a bar manager, bouncer or member of staff Stay with them and keep talking to them Call an ambulancetheir condition deteriorates Don’t let them go home on their own Don’t let them leave the venue with someone you don’t know or trust Try and prevent them from drinking more alcohol  Lewis Potton, editor at Student Beans commented: “Letting off some steam after a week of studying at a local bar is a staple part of university le for many.With many young people coming forward to share their experiences of drink spiking, we must be all aware of the signs that show a drink may have been tampered with, to help protect ourselves and those around us.” Comment MORE ON Alcohol\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Throughout October, the Mirror is Celebrating Black Britain - by highlighting every day the outstanding achievements and contributions Black Britons have made to this country. And today we explore some of the everyday items used in households across the world that were invented by Black people from as early as the th century. In some cases inventors failed to patent their creations which allowed others to swoop in and claim it as their own brainwave. Here we have listed some of the  everyday items created by Black inventors.  Blood banks Charles Richard Drew, an African American surgeon and medical researcher, is credited for his pioneering work with blood storage and transfusions. At the beginning of World War II he was the brains behind large scale blood banks that saved the lives of thousands of soldiers. He used mobile trucks with refrigerators to transport blood where it was needed. He also made sure all blood plasma was tested before it was shipped out and only skilled people could carry out transfusions to avoid cross contamination.  Hair straightener Madam C.J. Walker became the richest African American women of her time thanks to her work with hair inventions. Born into poverty, the entrepreneur, philanthropist, and activist invented a comb that would straighten curly hair.  She was created a rang of hair products which she meant she was worth a whopping million when she died in . Straightening combs have since evolved and are now more commonly known as hair straighteners.  Rolling pin Itaposs a staple in most kitchens and a must have for pastry chefs thanks to John W Reed, who invented the rolling pin. Late in the nineteenth century he patented the rolling pin as we know it today which has two handles connected to a centre rod. He realised by designing it this way it meant pastry could be successfully rolled out without cooks putting their hands on the rolling surface. Mr Reed also adapted more updated versions of a dough kneader. Traffic lights African American Garrett Morgan patented the three-position traffic light system in  which is still being used today. The son of two slaves noticed the traffic signals being used at the time had red for stop and green for go with no interval in between. He is said to have got to work after he noticed an accident at a problematic intersection and created the three signal system which includes an amber light. He later sold the rights to his invention to General Electric for ,. Gas mask Garrett Morgan is also the brains behind a smoke hood which later became a gas mask. The hood he patented in  was a clear airtight bag placed over the head which has an air filter held in the mouth which the wearer used to breathe. His invention was used in a tunnel construction disaster rescue in Cleveland which took place in . The smoke hood became the prototype and precursor for the gas masks used during World War I.  Wringing mop Thomas W. Stewart patented a new type of mop in  that made cleaning floors much easier. His clamping device could wring water out of a mop by using a lever. He first designed a mop head that could be removed by unscrewing it from the base of the handle and replacing it with a new one. Then he created a lever attached to the mop head which would wring water from the head without the user getting their hands wet.The UK began celebrating Black History Month, an idea first spawned in the United States and then also adopted by European countries including Ireland and the Netherlands, in October . Black History Month helps give context to modern le and the countryaposs history, while championing the experiences and celebrating the contributions of Black Britons here in the UK. The observation was first organised through the leadership of Ghanaian-born analyst Akyaaba Addai-Sebo. He served as a coordinator of special projects for the Greater London Council. Consequently, Akyaaba created a plan aiming to recognise the contributions of African, Asian and Caribbean people to the economic, cultural and political le in the UK. Door knob Itaposs dficult to think of a world without a door knob but before Osbourn Dorsey patented the creation we use today people used a dferent method. Only the wealthy were able to lock their doors, and until the African American inventor thought up the idea used today most had a latch-string device to keep their doors closed. He also created the doorstop and applied for a patent for both inventions in December . He was just  when his idea literally changed the world.  Lemon squeezer John Thomas White received a patent for a better way of squeezing lemons in . His invention allows us to obtain the citrus juice while keeping our hands clean. The earliest method of squeezing lemons dates back to the s. But the method we use today was created by the African American inventor. Fire sprinkler systemThomas J Marshall is credited with inventing the sprinkler system used in large buildings and businesses to effectively put out fires. In  he patented his idea which enables water to be pumped through pipes throughout the building. It came into use in the US two years later. Since , new buildings constructed in England taller than  metres must have a sprinkler system fitted.  Ice cream scoop Businessman Alfred L. Cralle invented the ice cream scoop. In  he applied for a patent on his invention which was a built-in scraper that allowed ice cream to be scooped with one hand. His creation was originally called the Ice Cream Mold and Disher and was designed to keep ice cream and other foods from sticking. He is claimed to have come up with the idea after he noticed ice cream servers were struggling to put large chunks on to a cone. There are many more inventions that were created by black people - this is just the tip of the iceberg. Refrigerated trucks Frederick McKinley Jones co-founded Thermo King and is credited for his innovations in refrigeration. The award-winning African American inventor and entrepreneur designed a portable air-cooling unit for trucks carrying perishable food in  and patented it two years later. He is self-taught in mechanical and electrical engineering. Mr Jones received more than  patents for refrigeration technologies and other advances including X-ray machines, engines and sound equipment during his career.

Alex Craig helped the -year-old boy and checked his wounds before the youngster was then rushed to hospital for emergency help. Helped by four other neighbours, Alex immediately ran towards the danger after the huge blast in Ayr on Monday evening.He and other friends dug the -year-old boy from the blast zone and took him to his home just  yards away, the Daily Record reports. His intervention came so soon after the blast that he had no idea how many other people,any, were still under the rubble. Alex and his stunned partner Vicky decided to head straight for hospital after being urged to do so by the first ambulance driver to arrive on the scene.  Alex said: “I was out the back when I heard the blast and it sounded like a bomb had landed. “I was shocked but I guess I instinctively ran towards the biggest wreckage because it was obvious that people would be caught in the blast and could be in the wreckage. “There was still dust and debris flying around the air but I got to the main heap of rubble and I could see a [boy] lying there, covered in debris. “By this time a few other local guys had come out, same as me, and we started digging him out.  “It looked like his arm was badly broken and he couldn’t see because he had all the dust in his face and his lungs. “I took him into my own house and my partner tried to make sure he didn’t have any catastrophic wounds. “It was hard to see what was happening because the wee boy’s pyjamas had melted to his skin. “My partner has luckily just finished a first aid course and she knew what to do, so she cleaned him up and we asked him questions about his name and where he lived and what school he went to, just to make sure he was alert and not concussed.” Alex and Vicky handed the boy over to his brother in law James and his partner Stephanie. Alex said: “We asked whether or not we should do the run to hospital and the police and ambulance guys who were there said just to go as fast as we could . They said that staff at Crosshouse Hospital would be told we were coming and to be ready for us. “The wee boy was awake and he was asking where his parents were and I think he was confused. He’d have been traumatised about being rushed to hospital but it was important to get him there as soon as possible.” While the youngster was being rushed to hospital, Alex ed to the scene to watch his parents and brother being taken out of the remains of their home.  He said: “I was still in a total state of shock and unable to take in what was happening but I was just hoping and hoping that they will all pull through this. “If you heard the sound of the explosion and saw the aftermath you would not believe that anyone could survive. We are just praying that there is good news.” The -year-old neighbour of the family was lucky to avoid injury. Betty Campbell and daughter Sandra, , were helped out of a window that had been blown out in the blast.  Betty and Sandra were taken to the home of family members to take refuge, wondering when they will be allowed back home.Her niece Allana Rennie posted on Facebook : “I’m so overwhelmed with everyone’s help I can hardly type for tears.“Thankfully Granny Betty and Aunty Sandra escaped with their lives and have nothing but the clothes on their back.” Allana appealed for friends to donate emergency clothes for the pair and was inundated with the response. Local people reported a strong smell of gas at Gorse Park prior to the blast. Gary Burgess, , said: “The smell of gas on Monday was so strong when I went for my morning paper. People were talking about it and you’re always thinking at the back of your mind there could be an explosion. “When the blast happened I was sure that a lorry had driven into the side of my house, which is  yards down the road from Gorse Park. He added: “All I can say right now is that I hope those involved in the blast get through it. But there needs to be an inquiry to get to the bottom of how it happened.” Comment MORE ON Rescue\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

This is then followed by a white flash - and moments later debris could be seen falling from the sky as it was blown through the air. Tiles and broken bricks were scattered in streets over  meters away as a result of the blast. Car alarms can be seen flashing on neighbour streets as the explosion shook through the town. Emergency crews raced to the suspected gas explosion after the alarm was raised while hero neighbours pulled the stricken family from the rubble. The explosion could be heard from eight miles away and residents have claimed there was a ‘strong smell of gasapos in the hours before. A joint investigation by Police Scotland and the Scottish Fire and rescue Service remains underway.  Devastated friend Michelle Buchanan posted on Facebook, calling for people to be mindful of those affected by the incident - particularly when posting on social media. She wrote: “My friends are in hospital in critical condition, please be kind when sharing photos and comments related to Kincaidston. “The house was their home and families and friends are worried sick. Get facts straight before rumours are spread. Love and best wishes to all affected.” She also changed her Facebook profile image to a touching picture of praying hands with the words “Pray For Kincaidston”. Many residents said the force of the explosion was like “a bomb going off”. A neighbour, who works in the gas industry, told how he saw hero nurses and a first aider running to the scene. He said: “I was standing at the back door, getting ready to take my dog out when I heard this massive explosion.  “There were big white flashes which is what happens when there’s a large concentration of gas. “The back door flew open so I ran round to see what had happened and the place was just covered in debris. “It’s quite a confined square where the properties are so an explosion like that just channelled the power all down into dferent streets. “I was telling people to stay away. Someone was trying to get a water hose but you can’t do that. “There’s quite a few nurses that live in this area because the hospital is close by so I saw them all come running to help. There’s also a first aider who ran across to try and help. Chief Inspector Derrick Johnston, area commander for South Ayrshire, confirmed the family were all in a serious condition. Police Scotland and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service said in a statement: Investigations are continuing following an explosion within a housing estate in Ayr.  Two adults and two children remain in hospital in a serious condition. A family of four were taken to hospital. A -year-old woman and a -year-old boy are currently within the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. A -year-old man is in the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. A boy, , is within the Royal Hospital for Children. Chief Inspector Derrick Johnston, area commander for South Ayrshire, said: “This is a complex incident and a number of dferent agencies are working together to establish the full circumstances of what happened. “Our thoughts are with the family and everyone within the local community affected by this. “A joint investigation with the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service is being carried out.

But after the events that happened after a women’s vigil, I know now I’ll never lose my fire to protect women from male violence. Reclaim These Streets Hull is a group that organises vigils in the centre of Hull City Centre. We led our second vigil last Saturday . We showed the names of around  women who had died at the hands of male violence collected from Counting Dead Women. We then held a two-minute silence to honour them and to shine a light on misogyny in our society. My mum and sister, once I had said my goodbyes, walked with me to Paragon Station so I could get my bus home safely. Once in the brightly lit station, crowded with people due to a local fair taking place, we sat down opposite my bus bay and waited. It wasn’t before long that a man who was sitting on a seat next to us interjected. “Where do you live ” he asked me. I lied and said a village on my bus route. “Where ” I repeated myself. “No, where [in the village] ” It had been  minutes since I had left the vigil on women’s safety before I was being harassed by a man. A man who thought he was entitled to know where I lived… in great detail. I refused to tell him hoping that would be an end to it. However, for the next five minutes, he continued to ask me where I lived, specically where in my village. Seeing my sister was uncomfortable, I made our excuses to get a cuppa from the Greggs shop slightly further up. We stood in the store for a little while when one of the staff askedwe were okay. When I explained what was happening, they called security. My sister then said to me and my mum: “He’s just walked past the shop…” I looked but couldn’t see him. The man then walked into the Greggs store, glancing at us as we walked to the other end of the shop. He had not only looked for us but had found us. I pointed him out to the staff members discreetly and the supervisor walked us to the bus bay. Once security came over, they waited with me until I got my bus. So a happy ending right  Everyone was safe, nobody was harmed…  Except we were harmed psychologically. When one man decides to act on his entitlement, it starts off a chain reaction. Not only were my mum and sister anxious walking back to their car at .pm, but in their panic they had forgotten to pay their parking fees . My partner came to collect me from a bus station halfway home. He was anxious about my safety. We decided to stay at his instead of mine to put our mental state more at ease. And me  I was more shocked at finding out that my stalker wasn’t the only one in the station Greggs staff had helped a lady weeks before who had become distraught over someone following and harassing her in the station. A couple of days later I found out other vigil attendees had been sexually harassed and even assaulted just minutes after the vigil ended on their way home. A collective of women who fear victim-blaming by police, lack of evidence on CCTVand the potential of it happening again. Within half an hour, six women had been harassed by at least one man. How many were harassed in one night  In  hours  So for anyone who thinks misogyny or male entitlement isn’t present in our society, please remember this story. For those who try to put us off standing our ground, please know we’ll never stop protecting our freedom to be safe on our streets and in our homes.

Also, wouldn’t it be freezing  I was intrigued enough to give it a go though, and took my first dip in August with one of my sons. ‘Plunging into the water, my first thought was – wow it’s cold! But actually, once you become acclimatised to the water temperature it feels wonderful. That first swim was really memorable, I came out of the water feeling revived and invigorated, and I knew I was a convert.’ Jenny persuaded three friends to form a wild swim gang with her and since August they have met weekly for a dip. ‘I don’t wear a wetsuit, it’s too much faff getting in and out of one, just a swimsuit and now I look forward to my swim all week. ‘Front crawling through open water, surrounded by the sounds and sights nature, it’s so amazing and it washes away the stresses of the week. It’s nothing like swimming in a pool, it’s both exciting and soothing, brilliant for body and mind. ‘It’s definitely going to get a bit nippier as we go into winter but I’m ready for the challenge!’ So in the spirit of taking the plunge and trying something new, e into a Zinger Popcorn Bucket soon - it is only around for a limited period, available until November .Download the app, head in store or order online.

Londoner Ross was recording his journey through South London on his hi-tech -degree camera. In the footage, he is quietly cruising down the street in Streatham on his e-scooter as he approaches a parked black Ford Fiesta. Without warning the car door opens suddenly right in Rossaposs path. The video, which was filmed back in August, but only just uploaded onto Rossaposs YouTube channel , then shows Ross taking a painful blow as he falls off the scooter.  He winces in pain as he limps to the kerb and sits down. The woman who opened the car door collects his belongings and brings it over to him. The woman is apologetic and immediately admits responsibility, but Ross is calm and forgives her. Ross said: I was fine, a couple of bruises and scrapes but nothing too bad.  E-scooters could be allowed to use the roads aposwithin the next  monthsapos as they are currently still illegal to use, despite them being a common sighting in cities across the UK. Sales have soared  percent during the pandemic and police have seized thousands of e-scooters ridden illegally. Anyone riding their own scooter on the streets now face a £ fine, six points and confiscation of the vehicle.

Previous iants of the coronavirus have wreaked havoc as they can spike infection rates across the country.Health experts from the NHS are now encouraging the government to enact its contingency plan for further restrictions, which may include another lockdown. Business secretary Kwasi Kwateng said in response: This time last year we didnapost have the vaccine. We donapost want to go back into lockdown and further restrictions. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Boris Johnson added: As you know it’s something we’re keeping a very close eye on because of the strength of our genomic capability we are able to keep a very close watch on any iants that are emerging.What is the new Delta plus Covid iant  The new coronavirus iant, known as AY.., is an offshoot of the Delta strain, which is dominant across the world.Viruses mutate and change to fight against the antibodies that learn to kill them. It means immunity to viruses are often hard to keep up with. Some virus iants are more easily spread and can be more infectious. Some strains are also known to be more severe. Is the New Delta strain more transmissible  It is currently unclearthe new iant is indeed more severe or infectious. Tests are currently underway in an attempt to determine this. However, according to Dr Jeffrey Barrett, the director of the Covid- Genomics Initiative at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridge, and Prof Francois Balloux, the director of the University College London Genetics Institute, AY.. could be -% more transmissible than the original iant. He told the Financial Times: Its potential higher transmissibility could at this stage only explain a tiny fraction of additional cases. “It’s around % frequency [now], and assuming it may be % more transmissible, that would only explain an additional % extra infections [every five or so days]. However, the PMaposs spokesperson said: Thereaposs no evidence to suggest this iant, which I think is the AY. you are referring to, is more easily spread. There’s no evidence for that but as you would expect we’re monitoring it closely and won’t hesitate to take actionnecessary.” Thereaposs no evidence provided to us that we have seen that suggests it is more easily spread. Will the Covid vaccine still work  Experts say at this early stage, it is unlikely the new iant will escape the current vaccines. Tests are currently under way to establish how big of a threat this new iant poses. The Covid- Genomics UK Consortium , which tracks new iants, said the new iant “is likely to become dominant” in Britainit is found to be more infectious. However, it said there is no evidence to support this yet. More recently experts have argued there is a case for a Delta-specic vaccine, according to The Independent.

Her nine-year-old pet suffered major injuries and later died of his wounds. The day after the owner of the two attack dogs offered to replace the pooch, Emma claimed. The health visitor says she still cries over the death of Blue weekly and is now jumpy around dogs.  She told The Mirror: The day after Blue died the owner texted me saying aposI understand the grief youaposre going through. This may sound a bit blunt, but would you like me to get you another Border Collie apos I said, aposAt present another Collie is not my priority. All I want at the moment is my Blue backapos.  The death has shaken Emma deeply and left her grieving for months on end. I am a community nurse, a health visitor, she explained. When I go into family homes, before I wouldnapost be worriedthey had a dog, it didnapost phase me.  Now I am scared, I get worried. I am very wary. We have a little Jack Russell. If I see a dog when weaposre out Iaposm on high alert all the time. I still cry on a weekly basis. Blue was full of le, he had so much energy. I look at rehoming pages for dogs, but I just canapost . Not at the moment. I canapost. Over the past couple of decades dog bite incidents have been on the up. A recent study found that admissions to human hospitals from dog bites almost tripled between  to , to , admissions three years ago. The rise easily outpaced growth in the dog population, which the Pet Food Manufacturers’ Association estimates to be at  million - up about  million in  months.  There is no official data about dog-on-dog attacks, meaning drawing conclusions about trends is hard. What is clear is that many people have suffered the personal trauma of witnessing their beloved pet being mauled by another dog. A quick search on UK petition website change.org brings up dozens of relevant results. Among them is Lynn Buchanan whose -year-old son watched on in horror as a Rottweiler attacked and killed his Jack Russell in Redding, Falkirk. Just before Christmas last year Eddie Lawrenceaposs Cocker Spaniel was mauled for  minutes in an attack which led to the dog having part of its mouth surgically removed. Both of them, like Emma, were dissatisfied with the official response to the attacks.  Essex police said that specialist officers determined the dogs involved in Emmaaposs case were not a banned breed and did not continue to present an imminent danger to people, so they were left in situ. Horried by their decision and determined to get justice for Blue and others like him, the mum launched a petition calling for dog-on-dog attacks to be made a criminal offence. She also wants owners to face more robust action.  Since starting the campaign earlier this year, , people have thrown their support behind Emma, with her local MP presenting the petition in Parliament. Emma continued: Owners need to be accountable. I would have liked the dog removed and assessed thoroughly. If that doesnapost work nor training, thena dog has attacked a dog for no reason, I donapost believe it should be allowed in a family home. They should be put in specialist kennels in a safe environment. If that canapost happen, then I think they should be put down. Reliving the events of the day Blue died, Emma claimed the other two dogs got under a garden fence and ran towards her. In the horrendous attack that followed, Blue was fatally injured, and Emma and a passer-by were also bitten. Emma said: I tried to get him off and couldnapost - I didnapost let go of Blue and he was shaking him and stuff - three passers-by stopped to help me - he [the dog] just wasnapost moving. It was relentless. One of them pulled the dogaposs head off Blue and picked him up and told me to get over this fence - Blue couldnapost walk or stand and had blood all over him. At :pm that evening Emma was called by the vet who delivered the sad news that Blue had died in his sleep. The Enfield woman continued: I wanted to help others and didnapost want it to happen to anybody  - thataposs how I deal with things, I was absolutely distraught and still am. Thataposs why I started the petition because I thought the trauma our family have felt to have nobody accountable for what happened - I wouldnapost wish that on another family, ever.To view the petition click here.

Were the diners right to leave  Have your say in the comments  The pub takes card details at the time of booking in case of no-shows or walk-outs, but the group reportedly said they would cancel their cards. Luke said the ordeal was immensely frustrating for him and his staff. He said: They were perfectly pleasant to begin with and then everything just changed. After theyaposd eaten about  per cent of the food, a lady brought her plate up to the bar and said it wasnapost to her liking, wasnapost what she expected, and could she swap to another meal for free   To which I said aposNoapos, because sheaposd eaten most of it and we canapost give food away for free when itaposs just personal preference. Thataposs not really how it works. Luke said his small team had already checked in with the group of customers and there were no complaints made about their food. When the group threatened to not pay their bill, Luke said he told them: aposThataposs not really acceptable, youaposve eaten most it, and you were given the opportunity to say there was something wrong with it.apos  He added: If theyaposd flagged it up in the check-back we could have done something to recty it. We donapost actively like making people unhappy, itaposs our job for people to have a really good night. We love people leaving with a buzz and knowing theyaposve had a great time with us, and  per cent of the people we have in are absolutely lovely and have a great time. We put in so much effort and passion and love, so every negative comment is taken personally. We will always do our utmost to fix a problemsomething is wrong -weaposve made a mistake weaposll hold our hands up and weaposll own it. So in an instance where absolutely nothing is wrong and people have kicked off, it hurts. The Pack Horse is one of the North Westaposs leading and most respected gastropubs, earning itself a place in the Estrella Dam Gastropubs list. Luke says that business has been great since they were able to reopen their doors after lockdown, but he says the post-pandemic kindness is fading. He said: I feel like there was a point in the pandemic where everyone was like aposBe kind, be nice. But Iaposve certainly noticed over the last couple of weeks that thereaposs been more stressed-out people with shorter tempers, and I know that thereaposs a lot of hard times for people at the moment, but it doesnapost take much to be nice to others. It was such a great opportunity to have that societal reset but I think some people have slipped back into their old ways. Business has been great, weaposve been so thankful for all the support weaposve had and weaposve been practically full every single weekend.

The man, known only as Owen, left the review minutes after leaving North Star in Cardf’s North Road in a huff on Tuesday afternoon. “Told off for having a sip of a shop-bought Coke from the shop alongside my overpriced pint so left, attitude problem,” wrote the enraged Owen.North Star’s manager David Rowlands then shared the scathing review on the business’s page, reports Wales Online. After viewing CCTV footage of the man, David wrote: “Dear Owen, you were politely asked to not consume your Tesco meal deal in a pub when the kitchen is open, as is standard practice in any food or drink establishment, and the price of our Blue Moon on draught is probably one of the lowest prices in the whole city.  “We have CCTV footage of our manager asking you politely to not consume outside food and drink in our venue.” David later said: “He came in with a bag, bought a pint, and then started consuming his meal deal. First the crisps, then the sandwich, then the bottle of Coke. One of our staff went over to him and told him he wasn’t allowed to consume food and drink from where on the site on our food-serving days. “On a Sunday evening and on a Monday, when we don’t serve food, we do allow customers to get a Subway or order food inthey want. It’s no problem for us and I don’t want them to go hungry. I don’t think many places would do that.” It isn’t the first time people have brought their own food onto the premises, David said. Not long ago a group of men thought they’d try their luck by bringing a few pasties with them.  He explained: “We’re only just starting to get some profit since we opened last August. We’re only now starting to work at full capacity again. And so it is quite frustrating when people come in with their own stuff. It would be nicepeople could make an effort to eat at their local independent establishments. The pub is trying things to entice customers by giving % off for students on a Wednesday evening and live music at weekends as the hospitality industry recovers from the y closures inflicted by the pandemic. They’ll also soon be doing karaoke nights on Sundays. David added: “We work hard and like to look after our customers and we work hard to have that iety on offer so it’s a shame when people decide to bring a Tesco meal deal in instead.” Comment MORE ON TescoCCTVPubs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Decimalisation came around to shake up the monetary system in the UK in , and while most people embraced the changes and moved on from shillings and farthings, one shop owner refused to accept the new system.Shopkeeper Frank Elliott was in his s when decimalisation was introduced, and instead of updating the prices in his shop – which were set up by his dad in Saltash, Cornwall, in  – he chose to turn it into a perfectly preserved time capsule, Cornwall Live reports.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Frank put up his closed sign soon after the monetary change, and continued living in his flat above the shop for another  years. During this time, the shopkeeper made his way through the tinned food and alcohol he used to sell – but he never threw any of the packaging away. Instead, he washed out tins and bottles and resealed cardboard packaging so that he could put them on display downstairs in his dream museum. Frank wanted his museum to become a place where future generations could learn what shopping used to look like, and he left his shop floor in the capable hands of Tamar Protection Society conservation charity upon his death in , who still look after it today. And now, when you walk into Frank’s shop, it’s like stepping back in time to an era before sell-by dates and plastic packaging. Several of today’s best-loved brands are still on the shelves, including Bird’s custard powder, Rowntree’s jelly and tins of Ambrosia rice pudding, as well as Daz, Ariel and Persil washing powder. But you won’t find any of today’s prices on display, as Frank’s shop sells Stork margarine for  d – or one shilling and six pence – and a packet of eight Lyons trle sponges are priced at one shilling and eleven-pence ha’penny.  Other items on sale have long been forgotten in the five decades since Frank’s shop closed – including ready to eat Jfi-jelli, Vencat Madras curry powder, and Cadbury’s Bournvita malt drink. There’s also stacks of Lebuoy, Palmolive and Imperial Leather soap, as well as two types of toilet paper – the ever-popular Andrex and the now-defunct Bronco.

They are currently living with a qualied and experienced foster carer who is used to looking after children in need of additional needs - but the pair need a family to have permanent security and care. Adopt South said that as a result of her le experiences, the eldest sister Issy can react in a way that seems younger than her age due to a delay in her development in her early years. At times, she can feel scared or confused as she cannot always work out what is the best thing to do. Adopt South says that during these times she can become scared or confused, or even angry, but is calmed and comforted with care and cuddles. Issyaposs foster carer added: Issy can be an adorable little girl, who has made amazing progress in the last year. She will spend hours talking and playing with her dolls, and pushing her pram around the house. Her favourite film is Disneyaposs Frozen. She needs a lot of comfort from a loving parent, or parents, who will have the time to soothe and help develop her confidence so she can flourish. Evie meanwhile is just at the stage of wanting to explore everything and enjoys spending time outside, playing with her foster parentaposs dogs and spending lots of time with other people who can read to and listen to her.  Adopt South said she also has dficulties expressing herself due to her early le experiences. Rachel Reynolds, head of Adopt South, said: Issy and Evie are lovely little girls who have been through experiences that most children their age would not have been exposed to, which makes them feel very vulnerable at times.

Fleas are finding perfect conditions for spreading in carpeted homes where the central heating is kept on all day long. These dubbed “super fleas” are breeding fast and are dficult to kill as they are resistant to many treatments.Experts are saying that the situation has been made worse by plenty of new pet owners who have bought animals during the pandemic.Chris Socratous, a pet care expert at Bob Martin told The Sun that people need to take steps to prevent them getting into homes in the first place.He said: Weaposve seen some really unusual weather patterns across the UK in recent months. When you combine this with thousands of potentially first-time or inexperienced owners who welcomed a pet into their home during the ious lockdowns, we could be facing one of the worst flea and tick seasons for years. The advice is to be well informed about what treatments are available for fleas and be aware of the dangers including Lyme disease that is a potentially le threatening infection. Fleas primarily, though, cause plenty of itching and chemists around the country have reportedly seen a rise in sales of creams for bites. Pet owners are also being urged to apply anti-louse treatments correctly as and when necessary. The British Pest Control Associationhas warned an infestation can rapidly spiral out of control as the creepy-crawlies reproduce.Female fleas can lay anywhere up to , eggs during their lespan, which means a few fleas can quickly create a large population of the biting parasites, reported LeicestershireLive.Dee Ward-Thompson of the BPCA said: “Female fleas take a ‘blood meal’ from an infested animal, then lay their eggs, which drop onto the floor and surrounding furniture before developing into larvae.“It is crucial to tackle a flea infestation without hesitation as they can quickly get out of control.”BPCA is urging people to be aware of the six signs of fleas, which are: Pets constantly scratching, licking or biting themselves Fleas or flea droppings visible in the coat of your petBlack specks that fall from your pet as you comb them which then turn redyou put them on paper and add water Members of the household getting bitten around the anklesBites on arms after you have been holding your petSpotting small insects on soft furnishings that jumpComment MORE ON VampiresInsects\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Rose said sheaposs “into Buddhism” and has been reflecting on the religion’s teachings that one should try to live le without regret, and is keen to find a job. The Oakwood woman hasn’t been following current affairs, instead using the lockdowns to serve as time of introspection to figure out what she really wants to do in le and how to achieve it.Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter  She said: “I guess I haven’t been paying attention to current affairs. I haven’t noticed. I’ve just been looking online and seeing how much money I have, ‘okay, I can work with that’. “This is the most financially secure I have ever been. I’ve never had a stable income of any kind. [In the past] I’ve just been doing odd jobs here and there, living with family.” Rose had been living in Israel prior to the pandemic “searching for like the meaning of le”. Not only did she work on a kibbutz, she spent her time doing lots of dferent odd-jobs like cleaning and factory work.  Rose was visiting the Aspire  Work centre in Leeds, next door to the jobcentre. She arrived “dressed for the job I want, not for what I have,” in a faux fur coat, scarlet head scarf, a choker necklace and polka-dot shirt. Rose says she was “excited” and determined to be making the next step in to finding a career. She has ambitions to become a psychologist but would be “happy to take a job at Tesco” at this point having struggled with her mental health for the past few years. “This is tax payer’s money, they don’t want to be paying for someone to have a free ride,” she admitted. “Le is just hard, that’s just a fact. It’s been hard in general, I never wanted to do this [receive benefits].” Reflecting on how she got to this point, she explained: “So many people have just complained about work and how work is so horrible. My whole le, I’ve heard that narrative and I think that’s really given me this belief that ‘work’s horrible and I really don’t want to do it’ - like why would you want to do something horrible   “At this point it’s about reprogramming my mind that work is an opportunity to meet my own needs – which is a strength – and so you can contribute something to the world, that’s also beneficial.” Universal Credit claimant Graham De’Ville, , has been receiving benefits for three months. He was previously a carer for his we but suffered a mental breakdown after they had a messy breakup.During his time on benefits, he’s volunteered with housing support service Engage Leeds. Asked about how he feels about the cut to Universal Credit, Graham said: “It’s the wrong time to do it, considering that food prices are going up for one, it’s going to send a lot of people in to poverty. “I’m in a lucky situation at the moment as I’m still with my mother but what would worry me is the gas and electric bills, food – all that would matter. Some people are living on £ or £ a week and it doesn’t cover it.” He added that he doesn’t trust the Government or even the Labour opposition party to manage the benefits system.

She wasn’t able to visit her doctor during the pandemic to identy the issue of her “stomach problems” and had to spend an extended period off work.Dawn says being out-of-work is “a bit boring”, especially since she had been consistently working for near  years.

They’re helping me with my CV today.” Asked how she felt about families affected by the Universal Credit cut, she said: “It won’t be great for them, it’s sad. £ a week is a lot to lose.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson defended the cut, insisting the taxpayer should not subsidise low wages through the benefits system and set out a vision for “high skill, high wage” economy.He told LBC Radio earlier this month: “What we won’t do is take more money in tax to subsidise low pay through the welfare system.”He added: “This Government is doing the dficult, long-term things.

Currently people needing an organ donation need to join long queues for one to become available through somebody ’s tragedy but that could be about to change. An operation in the US saw a pig’s kidney moved to a brain dead human on le support and now Dr Robert Montgomery, who led the operation, said the next step will be to carry it out on a person needing a transplant.“It’s going to give us that confidence that something’s not going to go wrong immunologically in these first couple of days, Montgomery told USA Today. We still are assuming a lot until we actually do this.”In what may sound like the realms of science fiction, a pig had its genes altered so that its tissues would not be immediately rejected, in a procedure carried out at a New York medical centre. Then the organ was given to a brain-dead woman, , still on le support, who had signs of kidney dys, following consent from her family. Over three days the new kidney was attached to her blood vessels and outside of her body to give access to researchers at the NYU Langone Health centre. “It was such a moving experience to talk to this family,” he said. “It’s just amazing that somebody would be so thoughtful and altruistic to be open to something that is not normalized in our culture like that. … It’s pretty extraordinary.” Test results of the transplanted kidneyaposslooked pretty normal, said transplant surgeon Dr. Robert Montgomery, who led the study.  The kidney made the amount of urine that you would expect from a transplanted human kidney, he said, and there was no evidence of the vigorous, early rejection seen when unmodied pig kidneys are transplanted into non-human primates. Importantly the recipients creatine levels, that indicate poor kidney , ed to normal after the transplant. The NYU kidney transplant experiment should pave the way for trials in patients with end-stage kidney failure, possibly in the next year or two, said Montgomery, himself a heart transplant recipient. Those trials might test the approach as a short-term solution for critically ill patients until a human kidney becomes available, or as a permanent graft. The current experiment involved a single transplant, and the kidney was left in place for only three days, so any future trials are likely to uncover new barriers that will need to be overcome, Montgomery said. Participants would probably be patients with low odds of receiving a human kidney and a poor prognosis on dialysis. For a lot of those people, the mortality rate is as high as it is for some cancers, and we donapost think twice about using new drugs and doing new trialswhen it might give them a couple of months more of le, Montgomery said.

The mum, who has since given birth to son Ethan, said: I was very pregnant, I was about  weeks. I wanted a nightshirt for when I was in the hospital because theyaposre easy to unbutton to breastfeed.

I didnapost want to spend a fortune because it was just going to get destroyed. I looked online and these two nightshirts came up. They looked really cute, really nice on the models and I could just imagine that I was going to look amazing in them. So, excited, I called off the search, ordered them in a medium and thought aposthis is great, my prayers have been answeredapos. Flash forward about five days when they were delivered.

After starting a new le in Belgium, Niki found solace in an unusual new hobbyNiki Colemont found a remarkable way to cope with dficult things that have happened in his le Image: Niki ColemontByJessica TaylorReal le features writer:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct | commentsAs a young child, Niki Colemont found it hard to adjust to le in Belgium. Heaposd spent the first four years of his le with his family in Rwanda. But he and his older sister, Soni, had had a dficult start to le after their biological mum died three months after Niki was born. Tragically, their dad later died in the civil war in Rwanda. Feeling like she had no other choice, Nikiaposs aunt put him and Soni into an orphanage just as the genocide was beginning. Soon, they were adopted by Belgian parents and brought to Europe to start a new le. Niki, now , told The Mirror: “I don’t have much memory of my childhood in Rwanda - it’s all very blank. “My sister remembered a lot more than me because she was nine years old when we left. But we didn’t talk about it much because she had a pretty tough time.” One of Niki’s earliest memories was waiting with Soni in a refugee camp in Rwanda for their adoptive parents to pick them up. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here When he eventually arrived in Belgium, he was suddenly thrust into a new world, dferent to everything he’d previously known.“It was very tough. I didn’t understand the language, the money was coming out of a wall, water was falling from the skies,” Niki said, describing his shock at Western le and weather.“I’d never seen snow before. It was so cold.” While he got used to a new le in a dferent country, Niki was grateful he had his big sister to look after him. “It made my le growing up a lot easier. I think she saved my le back then, I don’t know how I’d have managed without her,” he said. “Going to school was a big problem for me too. I had to go to a special school because I was very behind with my knowledge. “I didn’t know what the dferent colours were and I had problems with spelling and maths. I was far behind the rest of the kids, it wasn’t easy.”  But in time, Niki managed to catch up in his education and learned to speak the local language, Flemish. He also taught himself English through watching TV shows like Friends. “I learned to embrace le in Belgium when I made friends. Now I have a family who takes care of me and they’re very supportive, and I’m really happy.” However, tragedy struck a few years ago when Niki’s rock, Soni, died suddenly. “We still don’t know what happened, but the police found her body in her apartment. She’d been lying on the ground for two weeks,” heartbroken Niki recalled. “Some of her neighbours could smell something and they alerted the police. When the officers arrived she was just lying there. “I didn’t have the chance to say goodbye. It felt like I couldn’t go on because I didn’t know what had happened to her.” Luckily, Niki had his girlfriend, Ines, and friends to help him deal with his grief. But he also found solace in a hobby he’d picked up a few years earlier. He said: “Back in  I was walking around at my girlfriend’s grandad’s house. I was daydreaming and not paying much attention, but suddenly a squirrel came very close to me, maybe a metre away. “I stood still while the squirrel did his thing. He wasn’t scared at all. I knew I wanted to get closer to these animals, so I bought a feeder for the tree and filled it with walnuts. Then I waited each day for the squirrel to come and eat.” Soon, Niki, who works for a car manufacturer, was spending all his free time observing the squirrels in the garden - and before long, he was capturing photos of them. “I started experimenting with dferent set ups. I made a table and put moss and wood on it. Then I waited for the squirrel to climb up and start eating. “It was nothing special at first, but then I set up a fizzy drink can and put food in there. I captured a shot of the squirrel with his head in the can. “I looked at the picture and thought, ‘I can do something with this’. It was the start of something new.” Niki, who has no formal training in photography, took a few tips from friends about how to capture the perfect shot, and bought some new equipment to enhance the photos. “I was always thinking about my next shot and trying to get new ideas for pictures. It gives me comfort, it’s like doing yoga,” he explained. “When I see a squirrel running around, it gives me so much joy. I forget everything around me. It’s like my head is empty, I don’t think about my troubles, I’m just relaxed.”As Niki’s vision grew, he became more creative about how to capture a good shot, buying props from Facebook Marketplace.“I have a princess carriage which I bought second hand for € and it’s great. Most Barbie items are the perfect size for squirrels,” he said. When Niki sets up a shot, he’ll place food in just the right position for the squirrel to be at the perfect angle. Then he waits - sometimes for hours - in camouflage.Do you have a unique hobby  We want to hear from you! Email jessica.taylor@reachplc Although it’s a passion project, Niki hopes to start selling his amazing photos from his picfair account. He also shares his creations on his Instagram, @nikicolemont.“I want to show people how smart squirrels really are,” he said. “I also want people to find things that help them relax and be at peace. Everybody should have something that helps them.” Comment MORE ON Photography\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Content creator Kayla @kaylathayla recently ruffled some feathers when she appeared to suggest that two of the cameras are actually obsolete - but not everyone agrees.Taking to the app, Kayla shared a video of herself filming via a bathroom, before using her finger to cover each of the three lenses, one by one.

However, when she places her finger over the first two lenses, the camera continues to film her as normal. Itaposs not until she reached the third lens that she disappeared behind her finger. Iaposm so confused... are they fake  she questioned in the caption, adding a aposconspiracyapos hashtag. At first glance, it is a little baffling, however Kaylaaposs concerns were quickly answered by tech buffs in the comments section, who pointed out that the three lenses all have dferent s, and arenapost in use at the same time as one another. One helpful follower commented: One is a camera, the other one is ultrazoom, then the other one is your telephoto lens, and the black dot thing is a lidar sensor. Meanwhile, some other TikTok users were slightly less helpful and just took the time to mock Kayla for not knowing about the dferent lenses. Come on guys, weaposre not all into tech.

Addison Cassel, @addisoncassel, posted a video on TikTok in which she explained she was laying on her bed in an unnamed motel when she noticed a cut in the carpet just under the bed.She said she got on the floor with her grandmother and lted up the piece of fabric to find a wooden board, and when they lted that up as well, they were shocked by what they saw. Underneath the bed seemed to be a hidden room, which was completely dark and empty except for several cobwebs. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Addison wrote in her clip: “I was on my motel bed and I noticed a cut out in the floor. “Me and my grandma got it open – there was two layers covering it. “There’s a room under our room! It’s a one story motel.” The woman then posted a part two in which she stuck her phone down the gap into the room – which is actually just a crawl space. The second clip shows there’s nothing to be frightened of inside the empty space, and the dust and cobwebs building up inside prove the space hasn’t been used by anybody in a long time. And in another video, Addison answered several questions she’d received since her clips were posted. The woman said she phoned the motel after she’d left to ask themthey had any more information about the space – but they were weirdly secretive about it. She explained: “I called today and the lady that picked up was really rude to me. “I asked her, I was like, ‘Hey I stayed in this room number and there was a crawl space underneath the bed. I’m pretty sure it was a crawl space – could you tell me anything about it ’ “And she just kept asking me why I wanted to know. She asked me  times before she said anything, and then she was like, ‘It’s just for pipes. Have a good day.’ “Why was she being so secretive about it  All I did was ask.” Addison’s videos have over  million views, and viewers couldnapost help but think up scary scenarios for what might be lurking in the space under the bed.  One person wrote: “I watched a movie once about a psycho motel owner that had underground tunnels to each room, and he’d butcher them in their sleep.” While another said: “I watched an episode of Criminal Minds once where a stalker did that and stayed under her bed for months to video tape everything that went on in her bed.” And a third added: “Okay well you know what’s in crawl spaces  Bodies. Bodies are in crawl spaces. I watch too many movies.” But others were unimpressed by the videos, insisting there was nothing to fear. Someone posted: “Have you never seen a crawl space before ” And another wrote: “Itaposs most likely just an access  for the maintenance people in order for them to have easy access to the plumbing and stuff underneath.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Viral\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Along with the traditional orange pumpkins, you may also spot people out and about with teal or blue ones too.The blue pumpkin buckets are being used by trick or treaters to show households they have autism, Manchester Evening News reports. The idea was started by a mother in America who explained her decision in a Facebook post which has been shared thousands of times.She wrote: If you see someone who appears to be an adult dressed up to trick or treat this year carrying this blue bucket, he’s our son! His name is BJ  he is autistic. “While he has the body of a  year old, he loves Halloween.  Please help us keep his spirit alive  happy. So when you see the blue bucket share a piece of candy. Spread awareness! These precious people are not “too big” to trick or treat. “Love this idea! Hope he has a great Halloween,” one person commented. Another said: “I will be ready and waiting for BJ.” According to the NHS website, people with autism frequently have issues with social interaction and communication. By making it clear to others that a trick or treater is autistic, the hope is that households are receptive to a slightly dferent kind of interaction. Teal pumpkins may also be seen due to another campaign which also started in America in . The Teal Pumpkin Project is an awareness campaign from Food Allergy Research and Educationwhich aims to make sure children with food allergies or other dietary restrictions can also enjoy trick or treating. According to the FARE website, a teal pumpkin placed on a doorstep symbolises safety, inclusion and respect of iniduals managing food allergies.

original Delta iant, which itself is much more transmissible that the original Covid iants discovered in .However, with tests currently underway, there is so far no indication that it is signicantly more transmissible, and experts are keen to acknowledge that virus mutation is very common and not necessarily reason for concern.With this in mind, heres what we know about the so-called Delta plus iant...What is Delta plus AY.., or Delta plus, has been described as a \"descendant of Delta\" and was discovered by scientists in July , shortly after Delta became the predominant iant in the UK.While the new iants presence is increasing in the UK, it is not rising as fast as the original Delta earlier this year.Experts are monitoring the iant, however ithas notbeen deemed a\"iant under investigation\" or a \"iant of concern\".Delta plus has mutations which impact the spike protein, which viruses use to attack the bodys cells.If examination finds that this iant is likely to be more infectious than the original Delta, it will be promoted to a \"iant under investigation\".More tests will then be done to determine whether it should become a \"iant of concern\".The good newsis that currently experts do not believe that Delta plus will take hold, meaning it could drop off the watch list soon.What do experts say about Delta plus Professor Francois Balloux, director of University College Londons Genetics Institute, said \"dont panic\" regarding the new iant, which is \"nothing\" like the situation with Alpha or Delta.\"Its nothing compared with what we saw with Alpha and Delta, which were something like  to  percent more transmissible. So we are talking about something quite subtle here and that is currently under investigation.\"It is likely to be up to  percent more transmissible.\"Its good that we are aware. Its excellent that we have the facilities and infrastructure in place to see anything that might be a bit suspicious.\"At this stageI would say wait and see, dont panic. It might be slightly, subtly more transmissible but it is not something absolutely disastrous like we saw previously.\"What have Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson said about Delta plus In a tweet posted on Tuesday afternoon, Nicola Sturgeon said: \"The need to monitor this was discussed #at Scottish Government# Cabinet earlier.\"More generally, cases here - though lower than few weeks ago - remain higher than wersquod like.\"So pls take care: wear masks, wash hands, ventilate indoor spaces  get vaccinated.\"Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Boris Johnson said:\"Its something were keeping a

When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another. It is not about me, my job, my reputation, my status.

defeat.And last Saturday#s defeat came about through a goal each in the early and late stages of the match, despite a strong showing from the Kintyre Park side.Playing in a ---, Tarbert#s Craig Johnstone ed to central defence and John McCallum played on the left wing in place of the unavailable Rhys Casci, while Liam Renton ed to the fray on the right of the front three, in place of the injured Ross Brown.To compound all the chopping and changing of the team beforehand – a common feature of Pupils# line-ups due to injuries and work commitments in recent weeks – the Kintyre side suffered a huge setback on the pitch after two minutes.A Finnart corner, for all the world a Pupils# goal kick, was awarded by the referee, and the visitors# near-post delivery was flicked on and erted into the net by a Finnart head at the back post.Although the award of the corner was thought to be unjust, the home side was left reflecting on a set piece which could have been defended much better.The McFadyens-sponsored Pupils gradually settled into the game after this early shock and enjoyed decent spells of possession,perhaps only resulting in half-chances at goal – notably through a Scott Souden header which went narrowly by the post – throughout a tightly-contested first half.After the interval, the Pupils continued to press for an equaliser, but their battle-hardened visitors, who have enjoyed the winning habit for most of this season so far, were well organised in defence, with experienced substitutes adding a calmness to their play.Nevertheless, working hard in search of an equaliser, the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils had a foray into the Finnart box midway through the second half when Stuart Crossan played in John McCallum with a deft flick, but the latter#s right-footed shot flashed wide of the Finnart goal.McCallum found space in the box again soon after and cut the ball back to Scott Souden, a little too far behind, but was bailed out by the onrushing Liam Renton, who looked to have the goal at his mercy, but somehow a Finnart defender got back to block the close-range effort.Meanwhile, Pupils captain Keith Mitchell had switched from a midfield berth to left back during the second half, and the change was bearing fruit with a good deal of the Pupils# play developing down this flank.However, more frustration was to follow for the home side in the rd minute, as the Pupils# defence was exposed in a two-vs-one situation and an unmarked Finnart forward latched on to a through-ball and lashed a shot beyond young Pupils #keeper Alasdair Ferguson to give the visitors an unassailable - lead with so little time remaining.It was a bitter blow for the home side having put so much effort into earning at least a point, but hopefully it can be taken as another lesson in game management from an experienced and well-drilled opponent.Tomorrow , the Pupils are on their travels, taking on Paisley outfit Glenvale FC on league duty at the town#s Ferguslie Park.

The superb fluttering of light was of startling beauty and dazzling splendour, momentarily illuminating the sky from horizon to horizon.Accompanied by this brilliant display of lightscape were sharp cracks and outbursts of thunder, which rumbled, reverberated and re-echoed throughout the landscape with an eerie sort of foreboding effect.The phenomenon was characterised by a high percentage of fork lightning, which is most unusual in our temperate zone."},{"url":null,"title":"leader october 15","story":"It was encouraging to see a positive and constructive debate, with cross-party MSPs from across the region delivering a similar message.What matters now is what happens next.John Gurr, chairman of the Rest and Be Thankful Campaign group, has invited Transport Minister Graeme Dey and the area#s MSPs to join him in a journey along the route, #on the bus too,#desired.Whatever mode of transport Mr Dey choses to take one thing remains certain.

Surely they could be stored at the council depot, especially when not getting used.The grass throughout was cut and the loose grass was left lying in thick clumps, asit was a playing field, instead of a cemetery.This cemetery, in years past, won an award but I fail to see the same happening again with things as they are of late.The grass around the stones, at the sides and back, is not being cut, resulting in long grass and often ferns growing there are bollards lying loose which will undoubtedly result in damage to a car there are cones at the main car park, restricting the amount of cars that can park there, and there are also cones at the portable cabins the road in the cemetery is a total disgrace!I in no way blame the men who work in the cemetery as they are doing as they have been told to do, and I know they are taken from the cemetery to work where, resulting in those men not having the time to complete the work which is necessary to keep the cemetery in the condition it should be.I understand about cutbacks and lack of funds but I am wondering where the money goes that people have paid for plots and or council tax, which increase and yet there are even more cutbacks.My biggest concern is where has the respect gone The following is in response to the debate about the state of the A over Rest And Be Thankful in the Scottish Parliament last Wednesday, October .I fear that the current Rest and Be Thankful is a catastrophe waiting to happen and I think that there needs to be an urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver a medium-term and long-term solution for the people and businesses of Argyll.The Cabinet Secretary discussed the necessity to collect data for the end long-term solution and, as much as I appreciate that, it should have been done years ago and I completely understand the frustrations felt by businesses and travellers alike.The Cabinet Secretary also invited all contributing MSPs to walk the forestry road with engineers and I am going to write to him to accept that invitation."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week october 15 2021","story":"Graham took several nature and scenic shots while visiting south Kintyre recently, another of which we published last month.If you have a photograph you would like to share, please email it to editor@campbeltowncourier or send it via the Courier#s Facebook page."},{"url":null,"title":"tale of two halves as pupils lose out in paisley","story":"Campbeltown Pupils suffered late heartbreak last Saturday as they suffered a reverse away result to Paisley outfit Glenvale.Leading -

I have referred to this excellent record in providing information for this historical résumé.A further detailed company history is being prepared, though the rapidity with which West Coast#s evolution takes place means that it is hard to ever regard any such work as complete!Suffice it to say that John, David and William Craig, having formed a garage repair business just after the end of the First World War, then ventured into the realms of road passenger transport in February  by launching a service between Campbeltown and Tarbert to compete with Duncan Ramsay, an existing operator on this route.The Post Office then put out to tender its mail contract to meet the steamer at Tarbert. It was secured by what became the second of the famous Kintyre passenger transport company names, A  P McConnachie.Further new operators joined the fray and, as was common in those days, intense competition occurred everywhere in the country until regulatory route licensing was introduced in  with the arrival of the Road Traffic Act.Post Office mails and parcels contracts formed a key part of the Kintyre service network in a similar but much further reaching geographical spread, the now famous MacBraynes organisation of those times similarly carried parcels and mails to destinations across the western seaboard and western isles in its own fleet of buses and motor ships.In the mid-s,West Coast Motors obtained a contract to convey mails and parcels to and from Campbeltown and Glasgow. This was renewed at succeeding intervals and continued right up until .The vans and light trucks later used were every bit as smartly turned out as the coaches, and were an excellent advert for the company.To be continued in next week#s Courier."},{"url":null,"title":"whats on at campbeltown picture house","story":"Ron’s Gone Wrong is the story of Barney, a socially awkward middle-schooler and Ron, his new walking, talking, digitally-connected device, which is supposed to be his ‘Best Friend out of the Box.’ Ron’s hilarious mals set against the backdrop of the social media age, launch them into an action-packed journey in which boy and robot come to terms with the wonderful messiness of true friendship.Previews From ThursdayDirected by Denis Villeneuve Dune tells the story of Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, who must travel to the most dangerous planet in the universe to ensure the future of his family and his people.

The woodland is a nature reserve currently managed by the Scottish Wildle Trust.The upper path takes you to Innerwick Castle. This path is narrow in places, although quite well trodden so easy to follow.But it is sided by a steep decline into the gorge that demands you take care when walking. The castle, built in the th century, is perched dramatically atop a sandstone outcrop looking over the glen. It is picturesque now but a crumbling ruin in such a precarious condition that itrsquos not recommended to venture inside.I wrote of its history on this page over seven years ago, and will touch on it again here, but the purpose of this visit was mainly to explore the gorge below the castle, which Irsquod never managed to do.Irsquoll give a warning here too: the lower path that takes you closer to the burn, although marked, doesnrsquot seem to be maintained and is in parts very muddy and slippery. It can become an adventure rather than a woodland walk. But thatrsquos what we wanted.We were immersed in native woodland as we descended, embraced by ash and oak trees. The burn ran with some confidence through the glen, carrying the rainfall of previous days. Touches of autumn were everywhere, yet the summer canopy was still intact. It was a perfect combination.As the path heads deeper up the glen, the trunk of a massive fallen tree make it an obstacle course, but also an opportunity to sit and just take in the beauty of the place and soak up the birdsong.In those moments, it was possible to forget that we were, in fact, in a landscape dominated by agriculture and open fields. The steep sides of the gorge hide the fact that the wood is just a very narrow strip. The eye is deceived, the imagination lit and the senses lted.I was determined to make it to the water. The short scramble down to the burn from the path was a drama of mud.I know, Irsquom not selling this place so well, am I, but it was the challenge to reach the burn that made it feel so remote and wild once we got there.Then one of my kids, in between complaining about muddy shoes, said something that lit up the day for me.ldquoWow, you know, it almost feels like we are in a world of fairytale make believe, you know because we are in a wood that feels like itrsquos mysterious and magical at the same time.She summed up my feelings as I sat by the burn, listening to the water tumble over the rocks.I really wanted to walk up the burn to the point below the castle.Wersquod earlier peered down at the burn from the base of the rock on which the castle is built at least a ft-fall, I reckoned.It was far too dangerous to descend at that point, although I had wanted to it was where a Scots soldier from the castle leapt for his le in  when the castle was besieged by English hakbutters, an early kind of musketeer.He was desperate his comrades had been picked off by the gunfire, so he took the chance to escape.Miraculously, he survived the initial fall and was allowed to run to safety. Sadly, he made the fatal decision to run upstream, towards Thornton Castle, where he was seen and shot by a dferent group of English soldiers who knew nothing of his daring feat.The incident was recorded by an English eyewitness, but we have no name for the man who met his end so tragically in this gorge ndash just another nameless victim of a brutal war that became known later as the lsquoRough Wooingrsquo.Later, the castle was used as a base by moss troopers in  in their attacks on Cromwellrsquos supply route, but thatrsquos another story.The melancholy of the glenrsquos history didnrsquot diminish its beauty for me and I made my way carefully along the burn, jumping from stone to stone, getting my boots muddy and soaked in the process. It really was a magical experience in which my inner child felt free.However, I had a dferent kind of gunfire to contend with as I ventured upstream. Irsquod insisted my kids stay in a safer place and my we Kate was happy to be with them and keep her feet dry. But the children showered me with a volley of distant shouts and yells that they wanted to come too, which I felt would have been too hazardous for the youngest.So I was compelled to abandon my exploration in case they broke ranks you see, they donrsquot always do as they are told, especially when their dad is doing something they want to experience as well!But I will I can find the time in the winter, with perhaps just one of the kids: my own inner child."},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-cricketers-play-icc-mens-t20-world-cup-kit-designed-haddington-schoolgirl","story":"The ICC Menrsquos T World Cup gets under way in the United Arab Emirates and Oman this weekend.Scotland, who start their tournament against Bangladesh this Sunday, will be wearing a design created by Haddingtonrsquos Rebecca Downie.The youngsterrsquos pattern was chosen from more than  entries from schoolchildren across Scotland.

The vessel design is broadly based on our larger loch class vessels, which are double-ended.“Once the designs are approved, we will move to the next stage of the project, which will see the build of the engine to be used in feasibility studies.“The maritime industry has a key role in the global fight for climate change, and this project marks a step toward emissions-free marine transport.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I thought it might be fitting for the bell to be recommissioned and used again in remembrance of the  lives lost.”Towards the end of , Bill contacted a local craftsman and friend, Richard Wilson, and askedhe could help. It had been hoped to have the clapper made and fitted ready for the anniversary in , however plans had to be delayed due to the pandemic.In the meantime, Richard carried out online research and was eventually able to get inside the Cathedral to measure up, acquiring the bronze for the clapper proved dficult locally so he had to source it online.“It took me around a fortnight to make the clapper in my shed at home mostly using a hobby lathe and a CNC router,# said Richard.#I was a bit taken aback when Bill asked me to do this for him. Obviously, it is a great honour and a privilege for me to be asked considering the history of the ship and the lives lost during the sinking.#Hopefully this clapper will be around for years to come and will be used to commemorate the event each year.”However, this was only half the tale. The clapper needed a tassel — a rope that someone would actually hold to ring the bell.Fran Hollinrake is the visitor services officer and custodian at the cathedral.She said that, having attended several commemorations over the years, her and her husband Andy became friendly with a couple, John and Tracy Welch.John’s father, Stoker Petty Officer John Welch, was on board HMS Royal Oak the night she sank, but he survived.His son, John, was a rigger in the Tyneside dockyards, and spent much of his working le working with ropes, but ill-health prevented John from making the tassel.Instead he passed the job on to his former apprentice and friend Paul New.John and his we Tracy arrived in Orkney this week and were present at the unveiling.John said of his father#s experience on that fateful night: #The night of the sinking he was on deck having a cigarette when the explosion happened. He managed to get off the ship and into the water and was picked up by the Daisy II.#He said he had held on to another chap in the water who was in dficulty,  as he was an excellent swimmer and had medals for le saving and water polo, but when they were both pulled aboard by the crew of the Daisy unfortunately the other chap had died. He was lucky to escape with burns to his hands and face.#After medical attention I think a week or so later he was sent back to Portsmouth to join another ship.“As I far as I can remember he never ed to Orkney, but after the war attended the reunions in Portsmouth on a regular basis. As for his feelings about that night it wasn’t something he went into in great detail, but he did say thathe could get back on the ship he would know exactly where his gold lighter and cigarette case were.#Representing the council, who maintain the Cathedral on behalf of the people of Orkney, Councillor Stephen Clackson also has a personal connection to the Royal Oak, having tragically lost his uncle Ronald George Clackson when the ship went down.He said: “My Uncle Ronny was the closest sibling in age to my dad and his favourite brother. He was very technically minded and joined the Royal Navy on July , , aged ¾, for ‘  ’ years.#After training at the shore establishment HMS Victory, he was posted to the recommissioned HMS Royal Oak as an ordinary seaman on June , , when the ship was expected to be embarking on a -month tour of the Mediterranean.#Looming hostilities set the course of the battleship in another direction, and by August she was in Scapa Flow. My uncle was reported missing presumed killed when the Royal Oak was sunk by torpedoes from the U- in the early hours of October , just a week after his th birthday.#The news was devastating for my grandmother, whose brother had been killed on the Somme in World War I at the same age, and she never really got over it.

It is absolutely crucial people support those businesses as that is what the voucher is all about.”Colin Neill from Hospitality Ulster added: “Look, we all have to accept there are people maybe less fortunate than you and I, that this £ puts food in their cupboard.“But I think there is a huge dference between someone going and buying groceries in one of our supermarkets to feed their kids and using it for an Amazon voucher.“I think at this point we should be appealing to them [the supermarkets] and they should come out and make a statement and say they should no longer accept [the card] for that type of purchase.”During the show a number of callers admitted they would be using the Spend Local card to purchase vouchers for the online retail giant.One man called Graham told the show: “When I get my money, I am going to nip down and buy a voucher and I am going to spend it on Amazon.I am going to buy on Amazon something I can get for maybe half the price I can buy through my local retailer.”While the cards cannot be used online or for gambling or legal services like penalties, according to the Department for the Economy there is no technical way to prevent online gt vouchers being purchased in a store.They said the “limits of the technology” mean it is “not possible to distinguish between items within someone’s shopping basket”.In a statement from a department spokesperson, they instead encouraged the public to think of the local retailers who have been impacted by the pandemic and said an advertising campaign is designed to encourage this.“The High Street Scheme is designed to stimulate demand in local businesses, including retail and hospitality sectors, following the pandemic,” they said.“However, the scheme has also been designed to be as simple to use as possible in order to allow the public to spend their £ pre-paid card in local businesses.“It was set up so that businesses in Northern Ireland that can accept a debit or credit card as payment for goods or services they sell, can also accept the Spend Local cards as payment.“While it is possible to purchase some goods which will have less benefit to our local businesses, the Department would discourage this.”They added: “Indeed, the Department has been clear in its messaging to all card holders – use your Spend Local card to help those retail, hospitality and other sectors in your local area that have been most impacted by the pandemic.“This message has been embraced by many of our local business owners who are encouraging card holders to spend a little to give a big effect. We encourage Nolan Show listeners to do the same.”Most ReadPSNI confirm ex-RUC officer Brian Coulter is Magherafelt murder victimJake Bailey-Sloan’s heartbroken partner ‘in a million pieces after death of the love of my le’How £k electric Porsches are sparking a sales frenzy in NIMark BainOpinionBrian Coulter’s death…the murder next door: I received a message from a relative enquiring what was going on outside my houseMark Allen casts doubt over his future in snooker and says he may not see a penny of £k Northern Ireland Open prizeTop VideosPlayVideo: Fire Fighters battle major blaze in Antrim  \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ddda .ece AUTOCROP wh bbaafcafcfcbed.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ddda .ece AUTOCROP wh bbaafcafcfcbed.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police protect Army convoy after breakdown in BelfastPlayHockey player’s project aims to train  young lesaversLatest Northern IrelandDavid Jeffrey says doubters of full-time impact ‘living in cloud cuckoo land’ after Ballymena United’s defeat to LarnePolice to assess scale of drink spiking at nightclubs amid injection claimsPolitical leaders wish Queen well after Northern Ireland visit cancelledNorthern Ireland ‘in dark ages’ on equality laws, commissioner tells MPsNorthern Ireland bills for energy and petrol could jump by £, by end of year, warns Consumer CouncilLatestDavid Jeffrey says doubters of full-time impact ‘living in cloud cuckoo land’ after Ballymena United’s defeat to LarneNiall Quinn hat-trick means one Linfield staff member has to ‘hand out’ but boss delighted for ‘Mr Consistent’Baking queen Mary Berry to celebrate damehood with sandwichPolice to assess scale of drink spiking at nightclubs amid injection claimsScotland select  newcomers in Autumn Nations Series squad,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

bring us up into the modern age.“Northern Ireland had a long history of being at the forefront in terms of its equality framework and its legislative basis.“We have lost that position and we are at

consequences.She cited the example of Covid statistics.“We can’t even start to look at the impacts of Covid on ethnic minority communities and I think that’s a real dis-service that we’re doing to a very strong and vibrant part of our society, and we are actually breaching our moral obligations,” said the chief commissioner.Michele Janes, head of Barnardo’s NI, highlighted the same concern around

No one wants ato the draconian measures that have been in place for so long.The Executive has identied a robust and dynamic communication strategy as key in achieving this. Time will tellit can stay on message.Most ReadPSNI confirm ex-RUC officer Brian Coulter is Magherafelt murder victimJake Bailey-Sloan’s heartbroken partner ‘in a million pieces after death of the love of my le’How £k electric Porsches are sparking a sales frenzy in NIMark BainOpinionBrian Coulter’s death…the murder next door: I received a message from a relative enquiring what was going on outside my houseMark Allen casts doubt over his future in snooker and says he may not see a penny of £k Northern Ireland Open prizeTop VideosPlayVideo: Fire Fighters battle major blaze in Antrim  \"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ddda .ece AUTOCROP wh bbaafcafcfcbed.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news ddda .ece AUTOCROP wh bbaafcafcfcbed.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   \"PlayVideo: Police protect Army convoy after breakdown in BelfastPlayHockey player’s project aims to train  young lesaversLatest Northern IrelandDavid Jeffrey says doubters of full-time impact ‘living in cloud cuckoo land’ after Ballymena United’s defeat to LarnePolice to assess scale of drink spiking at nightclubs amid injection claimsPolitical leaders wish Queen well after Northern Ireland visit cancelledNorthern Ireland ‘in dark ages’ on equality laws, commissioner tells MPsNorthern Ireland bills for energy and petrol could jump by £, by end of year, warns Consumer CouncilLatestDavid Jeffrey says doubters of full-time impact ‘living in cloud cuckoo land’ after Ballymena United’s defeat to LarneNo risk leaving key Tottenham players behind for Vitesse Arnhem trip – NunoDoctors warn minister of opposition to assisted dying lawDigital trade documents ‘could speed recovery’Morocco bans UK flights due to rising coronavirus rates,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We are sticking to the autumn and winter plan we have set out.”Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the Government does not “feel that it’s the time for Plan B right now” but suggested it was a “good thing” for people to wear masks voluntarily.“I think people should do what they feel is the right thing to do,” he told the BBC. “They’ve got to, I think, be respectful towards other people, they’ve got to keep themselves safe and the public as well.”England’s chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty also stressed the importance of mask-wearing and encouraged people to take up the offer of a vaccination.“Covid- cases are rising and winter is drawing closer,” he said. “Ventilation, masks in crowded indoor spaces and hand-washing remain important.”COVID- cases are rising and winter is drawing closer. If you have not been vaccinated, now is the time. If you are offered a booster please take up the offer. Ventilation, masks in crowded indoor spaces and hand washing remain important.— Professor Chris WhittyOctober , The NHS Confederation is the membership organisation that represents the whole healthcare system in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.Mr Taylor said the NHS is preparing for what could be “the most challenging winter on record” and urged the public to “show extra support for the NHS” by “behaving in ways that will keep themselves and others safe”.He added: “It is time for the Government to enact Plan B of its strategy without delay because without pre-emptive action, we risk stumbling into a winter crisis.“Also, health leaders need to understand what a ‘Plan C’ would entailthese measures are insufficient.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk adffc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aff-cc-f-bab-febcddd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk adffc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aff-cc-f-bab-febcddd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk adffc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aff-cc-f-bab-febcddd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk adffc .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aff-cc-f-bab-febcddd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Press Association Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":true“The Government should not wait for Covid infections to rocket and for NHS pressures to be sky high before the panic alarm is sounded.”Mr Taylor saidthe Government “fails to get a grip” on rising coronavirus cases, the nation’s recovery from the pandemic could be “put at risk”.The NHS Confederation’s warning came as coronavirus deaths in the UK rose to their highest daily level since early March, while cases are at their highest for almost three months.On Tuesday, the Government said a further  people had died within  days of testing positive for Covid- – bringing the UK total to ,.While the numbers are often higher on Tuesdays because of a lag in reporting deaths and cases over the weekend, this is the highest figure for daily reported deaths since March .\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ae .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aff-cc-f-bab-febcddd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ae .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aff-cc-f-bab-febcddd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ae .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aff-cc-f-bab-febcddd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news uk ae .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_aff-cc-f-bab-febcddd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Press Association Images FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueMeanwhile, the seven-day average for cases is standing at , infections per day.Despite the success of the initial Covid- vaccination campaign, there are concerns in Westminster around the take-up of booster shots and jabs for  to -year-olds.Mr Kwarteng told Sky News the slow uptake in this phase of the programme is “something that we really need to address”.Just over % of the UK population has received two doses of vaccine, according to Government figures – compared with at least % in Denmark, % in Spain and % in Portugal.Prof Whitty said “ you have not been vaccinated, now is the time” and “ you are offered a booster, please take up the offer”.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As we get close to winter, make sure you get a booster jab when offered to maintain your protection against Covid and keep your loved ones safe.”When he appears in Downing Street at around pm, Mr Javid is expected to echo the call for increased vaccine take-up.

Photo: Martin McKeown.Reporter: Staff Reporter Oct   addthis, Claudy para-triathletes Chloe and Judith MacCombe have put themselves in pole position for a place in the Northern Ireland team for the Commonwealth Games after claiming first and second place at the national championships in Limerick. Chloe’s gold medal finish and her twin sister Judith’s runner up spot was a reverse of the result at the same competition in Drogheda pre lockdown in . googletag.cmd.push It leaves them in eighth and tenth place respectively in the Commonwealth Games rankings where the top ten will qualy for the games in Birmingham next summer. They have been working daily towards their goal at the Foyle Arena where Derry City and Strabane District Council’s Athlete Support Membership Scheme gives them free access to Council leisure facilities. The -year-olds are former students at Limavady Grammar and were diagnosed at birth with a form of albinism that means their sight is around one third of what someone with   vision would experience. They have barely spent a day apart in those  years and both studied geography at Ulster University in Coleraine during which time a chance meeting with Irish triathlon high performance coach Eamon Tilley guided them towards the gruelling discipline.     “We weren’t overly sporty growing up,” Chloe recalled. “We got involved in rugby and rowing at Coleraine and were talent spotted by the Irish para rowing team and while we were there Eamon Tilley suggested we try the triathlon. “We started going to training days in  and we took part in our first race in , we didn’t perform that well but enjoyed the challenge of pushing ourselves so we did a few more events and started to improve.” The big breakthrough for the girls came in  when Judith claimed first and Chloe second place at the National Paratriathlon Championships at Pulse Port Beach in Drogheda, it looked to be the start of an exciting period but the Covid  pandemic led to an end to all competition in . “It was a big challenge to keep the momentum of our training going during lockdown,” said Judith. “We had been coming to the Foyle Arena  or  times a week so to lose access was a big blow. “We have an intimate knowledge of the back roads of Claudy from all the cycling and running we did while the centre was closed, it has been great to get access back, particularly in the pool which has now been ided up for dferent swimming speeds.” “Limerick was our first major event after lockdown so we weren’t sure how it would go,” Chloe added. “I am stronger on the bike but I knew Judith would make up ground on me on the run so I had to make sure I had a lead. “The membership scheme has had a massive impact on our success, training for a triathlon is very expensive and we don’t get any funding so it has been a real leline. “The facilities at the Foyle Arena are world class and the staff and coaches here have been very accommodating and taken a genuine interest in our journey. “To compete at the Commonwealth Games alongside my sister would be a dream come true and that goal drives us each day to train harder and get faster.” Opportunities The Athlete Support Membership Scheme aims to provide talented local athletes involved in an amateur sport with the best possible opportunities to develop and prepare for competition. Applicants must be currently part of a recognised gover​ning body, talent pathway or be officially representing their sport at county level or higher. Applicants who fulfil the criteria will be entitled to six months free access to gym, health suite and swimming pool facilities, they must be involved in an amateur sport which is recognised by either Sport Northern Ireland or the Irish Sports Council. Sports coordinator at Derry City and Strabane District Council, Keith Thompson, said: “World level athletes need world class facilities to compete at the highest level and we are delighted to be able to support a number of elite athletes at the Foyle Arena through free membership. “The team at the Foyle Arena are delighted for them and we are pleased to have played a role in their success.” To apply for the Athlete Support Membership scheme e mail Keith at keith.thompson@ derrystrabane.

It comes as part of the Northern Irelands Executives winter Covid contingency plans. The Executive said there was a need to keep as many sectors open to the fullest possible extent. First Minister, Paul Givan said doing that would depend on as many people as possible getting vaccinated.” googletag.cmd.push Just over % of people aged  and above in Northern Ireland had received one dose of the vaccine. Mr Givan said: Our vaccination rates are very good but there is still room for improvement.” Further Covid restrictions are due to be relaxed by the Executive onOctober . This will allow for nightclubs to reopen, restrictions on indoor dancing lted and the requirement to be seated in hospitality to drink and eat food will no longer be in place. Mr Givan said it was a fact of le that Covid remains an ongoing issue, and that the Executive needed to continue to find ways to manage the situation.     The First Minister says that the Executive will launch a new public information campaign before the end of October to build on the need for all of us to keep making safer choices. He also said that there would be a focus on “flexible and hybrid working” in workplaces. Mr Givan set out a range of optionsCovid cases rise drastically or hospital pressures become “unsustainable” with the possibility of deploying Covid vaccine passports in high-risk settings, “ considered appropriate.” The Department of Health at Stormont is also working on a systemthis situation arises that would see the strengthening of self-isolation rules for close contacts of those who contract the virus and a re-imposition in law of social distancing in certain settings. He continued: The efforts that have been made by so many in recent months to drive up vaccination rates and step-up compliance with mitigations do seem to be working. It is vital that we dont let up. We must maintain our focus and collective endeavour.

It comes as part of the Northern Irelands Executives winter Covid contingency plans. The Executive said there was a need to keep as many sectors open to the fullest possible extent.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm.     When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDrugs seized in County Derry villages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSinn Feacutein member silenced after B Special event funding question overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey was laid to rest on Saturday Derry NewsKatrinaRainey: “alady of gold” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMLA criticises isive and crass B Specials re-enactment in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  You havent got a clue - Presenter loses cool with former British MEP on Irish historyNational NewsYou havent got a clue - Presenter loses cool with former British MEP on Irish history overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsPolice appeal for sightings of murdered County Derry man overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDrugs seized in County Derry villages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSinn Feacutein member silenced after B Special event funding question overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey was laid to rest on Saturday Derry NewsKatrinaRainey: “alady of gold” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMLA criticises isive and crass B Specials re-enactment in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  You havent got a clue - Presenter loses cool with former British MEP on Irish historyNational NewsYou havent got a clue - Presenter loses cool with former British MEP on Irish history overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsPolice appeal for sightings of murdered County Derry man overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The scheme is a recycling initiative which he had championed during his time as Environment Minister and has worked to progress in recent years. In response to an Assembly Question tabled by Mr Durkan, the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , Edwin Poots reaffirmed his commitment to introduce the scheme, following the department’s joint consultation with DAERA and the Welsh Government. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle MLA said: “I’m pleased that work is continuing to progress a depositscheme for Northern Ireland. “This is a scheme which began work on during my time as Environment Minister, having seen their benefits in other countries. “Unfortunately, at that time my attempts were met with some resistance, both politically and commercially. “In February , the Executive supported my calls for the introduction of a depositscheme and committed to the North’s participation in a proposed UK-wide rollout. I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy.     “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment. “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDrugs seized in County Derry villages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSinn Feacutein member silenced after B Special event funding question overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices -

Rhonda McKean, , had a bout of painful sciatica that made it dficult to walk. Using a rollator frame, she took a fall and was told by her Doctors surgery, Oakleaf Medical Practice, to make her way to Altnagelvin. googletag.cmd.push However, a nine-hour wait in pain followed that didnt even result in Mrs McKean being seen that day. As a result, she had to make ajourney where she was eventually X-rayed. She said: “Six weeks ago, I had sciatica and during the night, it became so uncomfortable that it wouldnt let me walk. “I had a rollator in the house and I thought Id use that because theres no way that I would be able to get about. “Unfortunately, I managed to fall hard on to the ground and I knew that I hurt my back. “I rang the doctors surgery and was told Id get a call back from the doctor. Instead, I get a call back from the physiotherapist.     “He told me to come overso I struggled over and he told me I needed to go to Altnagelvin Hospital for an X-ray on my hip because he thought I had fractured that. “I told him that I definitely hadnt fractured my hip but had hurt my back. The X-ray showed that I hadnt broken my hip. “I went back to the surgery and the physio went to get the doctor who came back and told me that the physio wanted me to go to Altnagelvin because he thinks youve had a stroke. “I then get to Altnagelvin where I sat in the waiting area at casualty for nine hours. “I had been sent to get a brain scan but they wouldnt do one because they said I didnt have a stroke. “But during all that time, I was in pure agony as having been sitting in AE for nine hours. My back was broke but the doctors hadnt told me as they hadnt read the report in the bone scan. “I later had an X-ray and was told I had an L lumber fracture. I then had a further MRI scan.” Unfortunately, that scan would bring bad news for Mrs McKean which was compounded by it being given not by her GP at Oakfield Medical Practice, but by the receptionist. Mrs McKean added: “Last Friday , I got a letter to go to X-ray for an ultrasound on my thyroid. “I phoned up the surgery to speak to my GP to ask why I have been requested to go for an ultrasound to my thyroid. “The girl on reception put me on hold and then came back to tell me, the MRI scan showed a growth on your thyroid. “The receptionist told me that and the doctor himself couldnt even let me know. He didnt even have the decency to phone me and tell me this was happening. Yet its left to a receptionist to tell me point-blankely because theywont let me speak to a doctor.” Regarding Mrs McKeans nine-hour wait at Altnagelvin, a spokesperson for the Western Health and Social Care Trust said: “Due to patient client confidentiality we would not be responding to inidual cases. “If a patient client or their relative has any issue in relation to their treatment or the service they have received, we would encourage them to raise these issues through the Trusts comments and complaints system - the Patients Advocate Office. “The Patients Advocate Office can be contacted on . All complaints received are investigated promptly and a response issued to the person.” And in relation to how Oakfield Medical Practice broke the news to Mrs McKean of her thyroid growth diagnosis, a spokesperson for the Health and Social Care Board added: “It would not be appropriate to discuss issues in relation to inidual patients. “The patient should raise her concerns with the practice in the first instance andnot satisfied following that can approach the Health and Social Care Board through the complaints process. “If the complaint cannot be resolved through the HSC Complaints Procedure the patient can approach the NI Public Services Ombudsman.”  Defendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told  Thomas Rainey was remanded in custody until November .

An event held in Coleraine by Cuil Rathain Historical and Cultural Centre to mark the centenary of the establishment of Northern Ireland included a re-enactment of a B Specials checkpoint and drill demonstration as part of its itinerary. googletag.cmd.push Alongside music and dance demonstrations, involving bands and Lambeg drums, and childrens arts and crafts activities, a group held a historical re-enactment, complete with unorms and props.  The B Specials, known as the Ulster Special Constabulary, was formed just before partition, and was almost exclusively Protestant. They were involved in a number of controversial incidents, including the attack on civil rights marchers at Burntollet in , before being disbanded in . East Derry MLA Cara Hunter said the staging of the re-enactment was not appropriate. I am shocked that the organisers of this event thought that this was in any way appropriate, said the SDLP representative.     Contrary to the public comments from the festival organisers, there is no positivity associated with this sectarian force that maimed and murdered Catholics at Civil Rights protests. Cara Hunter MLA “The inclusion of this event in this centenary programme is isive, crass and alienating. It sends a clear message that the organisers have no interest in promoting cross community cohesion. More to the point, it suggests that the B Specials represent the tradition of unionism here. That could not be further from the truth. The event was advertised as being funded by the Ulster Scots Agency and Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, with the organisations providing pound, and pound, respectively. However, the Cuil Rathain Historical and Cultural Centre said the re-enactment had been entirely self-funded. We feel it is important that we, as the lead partner of the organising committee, clary the situation in relation to funding arrangements in respect of the B Specials Historical Re-enactment group, they said. We wish to confirm that this element of the programme is being self-funded entirely by the organisers. No funding awarded by either Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council or the Ulster Scots Agency will be used in respect of this element of the event programme. We hope that this statement claries the situation and allays any concerns anyone may have. On the day after the event, the group also shared what they described as an informative presentation on the B Specials to their Facebook page.

On Friday evening, DfI announced that advice issued around the development of farm and in-fill dwellings had been withdrawn after what they described as a signicant response. googletag.cmd.push “The PAN did not add to or change existing planning policy,” said a spokesperson. “The Department had not expected such a signicant response to what is essentially an advice note to support the efficient and effective workings of the two-tier planning system. “Regrettably, rather than bringing certainty and clarity, as was its intention, the PAN seems to have created confusion and uncertainty.  DfI Minister Nichola Mallon “The Department has listened carefully to and reflected on all the concerns and has decided to withdraw the PAN today to swtly restore clarity to this situation. “The Department will now take stock of the concerns raised and undertake further engagement and analysis on this important policy area, to include consideration of current and emerging issues, such as the climate emergency and a green recovery from this pandemic.”     Issues around the planning notice had been first raised in August by Mid Ulster councillor Sean McPeake, with a number of planners also contacting the County Derry Post to raise their concerns. Mid Ulster District Council also wrote an official letter to DfI calling for the advice to be withdrawn, as neighbouring councils also voiced their frustration with the notice. Cllr Sean McPeake Cllr McPeake welcomed the withdrawal of the Department advice, branding it a harmful diktat that should have not been introduced without consultation and agreement. “This PAN was clearly imposing additional signicant planning restrictions across a number of planning policy areas,” said the Sinn Feacutein representative. “Despite packaging the note as ‘Guidance’ Councils were left with no option but to take into account the new restrictions within the PAN when determining on rural planning applications. “These were policy changes as they were directing Councils to refuse planning applications which did not meet their new restrictive directives within ‘dwellings on farms’, infill development and clustering. “Since August   Planning departments within Councils were having to change initial opinions to applications already within the planning system on many applications from approvals to refusals. “Since the devolution of planning powers to Councils in , they have been successfully working within the parameters of the policies devolved to them from Stormont. “The outworking of the recent PAN was to make an already restricted policy even more restricted with additional caveats requiring to be overcome before planning approval would be granted. “Ministers in government and their governmental departments need to listen carefully to the needs of rural people and their communities and tailor rural sustainability policies to suit.” Emma Sheerin MLA A Sinn Feacutein motion and debate was due to be tabled in Stormont today, and Mid Ulster MLA Emma Sheerin said she was delighted it was no longer necessary. “We had tabled a motion that was due to be moving today,” she said. “I had submitted several questions to the Minister about this and am delighted that she has responded to the pressure and rescinded this advice which would have ruled out many peoples homes.” Fellow Mid Ulster MLA Patsy McGlone also welcomed the withdrawal of the advice on Friday. “While the intention of the advice note was to help to bring certainty and clarity for councils, unfortunately the PAN seems to have created confusion and uncertainty,” said the SDLP representative. “I welcome that the Minister has listened to the concerns raised, especially in the rural communities and by our rural representatives, and has instructed the Department to withdraw the PAN. “It is right that the Minister and the Department have committed to further engagement including consideration of issues related to the climate crisis and a green recovery from this pandemic as we seek to support our rural communities across the North.” Chris Cassidy Chris Cassidy, of CMI Planners  Architecture Ltd, said the decision marks a victory for country dwellers. “Im obviously delighted that this PAN has been withdrawn. The issuing of this document was clearly a change of Planning Policy and quite rightly required consultation with interested bodies,” he said. “Its withdrawal will once again let Council members have the final say on applications based on policy and local knowledge. “The effort put in by elected representatives and agents is a victory for every person wanting to remain in the country side and were very proud to have played a small part in its removal.”  County Derry planning concerns raised at Assembly  Mid Ulster MLA Emma Sheerin has raised the matter in Stormont.

Castlerock footbridge is the subject of a ,-year lease to Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, entered into by the legacy Coleraine Borough Council in . googletag.cmd.push The bridge was removed in  to assess whether or not it could be restored and to investigate costs for any work required. Councillors recently raised concerns that the bridge was now sitting exposed to the elements, with Cllr Adrian McQuillan previously describing it as a big rusty mess. Now a report to the Environmental Services Committee has revealed further analysis on the bridge will take between  and  weeks. “Mann Williams Consultants have issued costs to complete the additional analysis necessary to satisfy the requirements of Translink and Council that the bridge is safe to re-install,” said the report.     “This work will commence shortly and is estimated to take - weeks. Council and Translink have agreed to meet monthly to keep abreast of progress.” An exasperated Cllr Richard Holmes asked a council officialTranslink would ever be satisfied the bridge could be safely re-installed. “The report is  or  weeks away, which seems an awful long time given how long weve already sat doing inspections on this,” said the UUP representative. “There is a chance that Translink are going to throw up obstacle after obstacle and we could be sitting here in ten years time with just a few elements of rust being left. “The bridge stood there for years, and local engineering firms took it out, fixed it and left it back previously. We didnt have to go through this amount of work. “Is it a case that no matter how many reports we do, somebody at Translink is quite happy for this bridge never to be put back in place ” Council official Aidan McPeake said there were design standards that had to be met. “Translink must be satisfied the bridge meets them,” he said. “Having done the initial analysis, it doesnt meet that, so were having to do these further finite element analysis on it. “If after this, it still doesnt pass, Translink wont let it back in. Thats the bottom line.” “It could be in Garvagh museum yet,” responded Cllr Holmes.  pound, spent allowing County Derry footbridge to become a big rusty mess  Cllr Adrian McQuillan has vowed to keep the issue on the Council agenda.

Cahore Playing Fields in Draperstown is currently home to Draperstown Celtic Football Club, who requested that Mid Ulster District Council upgrade the facilities back in February . googletag.cmd.push The proposal was approved at last weeks Development Committee, with plans to move forward with a sub-leasing arrangement also given the go-ahead. Local company Heron Bros currently lease the land directly to the Council, with the lease ied in  to a term of  years, backdated to April  . After public expressions of interest were sought in September, submissions for the two soccer pitches and one GAA pitch were received from Draperstown Celtic FC and St Colms GAC Ballinascreen. A site map of the location in Draperstown showing the pitches. Both clubs have indicated acceptance of LPS rent valuations for the site, with the soccer pitches to be rented at pound, per year and the GAA pitch at pound, per year.     Council will retain control of the sites pavilion under the arrangement due to the muli-sport nature of the facility, with clubs paying pound each in a keyholding arrangement. An initial survey carried out by a local contractor has indicated a cost of around pound, to upgrade the facilities, with the GAA pitch and one soccer pitch experiencing poor drainage. The report indicated the upgrade would focus on the GAA pitch, with the security provided by the lease allowing Draperstown Celtic to apply for funding to develop a G pitch in place of one soccer pitch. Councillor for the area, Catherine Elattar, said improvements at the site were overdue. “This seems to be a sensible approach. Money does need to be spent bringing the pitches up to standard,” said the Sinn Feacutein representative. “The leasing arrangement will allow the cost of this to be recouped in a relatively short period by Council. “It also allows local clubs to take over responsibility for the pitches, which will benefit the local community, as these clubs do an awful lot of important work in the area. Catherine Elattar spoke in favour of approval. Cllr Water Cuddy said he would not be voting against the proposal, but told the Committee it did seem very complicated. “Ive just cant understand why we dont step out and let the two clubs talk to the landowner,” he said. “Any public organisation needs to have policies in place and follow those through, becausewe start stepping outside policies, it gets very dficult. “We need to keep this as tidy as possible. Can we not just sign this over to the clubs without the spend so they can draw down the funding themselves  “Theyre getting pound, of grant aid through the back door almost. We need to keep things clear and transparent. “Its great to see it being delivered, and Im not against the project, but it just seems so complicated.” Cllr Cuddys UUP colleague, Cllr Trevor Wilson raised questions over how quickly the process had been undertaken. “My concern is that this was brought before us in February and we now have a report sitting [proposing] to go ahead with this,” he said. “I brought a report last year on another sporting facility and it has never reached this table. It makes you wonder. Ill just leave it at that.” Draperstown Celtic will join St Colms GAC Ballinascreen at the facility. Cllr Elattar said she was glad to hear Cllr Cuddy would not vote against the proposal. “These pitches in Cahore are not fit for purpose. If you come up to see them, you could be up to your knees in water,” she said. “The soccer team has to travel sometimes to Dungiven to play matches because they cant actually use the pitches. “The money needs to be spent whether or not the lease goes ahead. The lease gives the clubs ownership and lets them apply for outside funding that will add to what these pitches offer.”  County Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home  The -year-old has been disqualied from driving.

Cahore Playing Fields in Draperstown is currently home to Draperstown Celtic Football Club, who requested that Mid Ulster District Council upgrade the facilities back in February . googletag.cmd.push The proposal was approved at last weeks Development Committee, with plans to move forward with a sub-leasing arrangement also given the go-ahead. Local company Heron Bros currently lease the land directly to the Council, with the lease ied in  to a term of  years, backdated to April  . After public expressions of interest were sought in September, submissions for the two soccer pitches and one GAA pitch were received from Draperstown Celtic FC and St Colms GAC Ballinascreen. A site map of the location in Draperstown showing the pitches. Both clubs have indicated acceptance of LPS rent valuations for the site, with the soccer pitches to be rented at pound, per year and the GAA pitch at pound, per year.     Council will retain control of the sites pavilion under the arrangement due to the muli-sport nature of the facility, with clubs paying pound each in a keyholding arrangement. An initial survey carried out by a local contractor has indicated a cost of around pound, to upgrade the facilities, with the GAA pitch and one soccer pitch experiencing poor drainage. The report indicated the upgrade would focus on the GAA pitch, with the security provided by the lease allowing Draperstown Celtic to apply for funding to develop a G pitch in place of one soccer pitch. Councillor for the area, Catherine Elattar, said improvements at the site were overdue. “This seems to be a sensible approach. Money does need to be spent bringing the pitches up to standard,” said the Sinn Feacutein representative. “The leasing arrangement will allow the cost of this to be recouped in a relatively short period by Council. “It also allows local clubs to take over responsibility for the pitches, which will benefit the local community, as these clubs do an awful lot of important work in the area. Catherine Elattar spoke in favour of approval. Cllr Water Cuddy said he would not be voting against the proposal, but told the Committee it did seem very complicated. “Ive just cant understand why we dont step out and let the two clubs talk to the landowner,” he said. “Any public organisation needs to have policies in place and follow those through, becausewe start stepping outside policies, it gets very dficult. “We need to keep this as tidy as possible. Can we not just sign this over to the clubs without the spend so they can draw down the funding themselves  “Theyre getting pound, of grant aid through the back door almost. We need to keep things clear and transparent. “Its great to see it being delivered, and Im not against the project, but it just seems so complicated.” Cllr Cuddys UUP colleague, Cllr Trevor Wilson raised questions over how quickly the process had been undertaken. “My concern is that this was brought before us in February and we now have a report sitting [proposing] to go ahead with this,” he said. “I brought a report last year on another sporting facility and it has never reached this table. It makes you wonder. Ill just leave it at that.” Draperstown Celtic will join St Colms GAC Ballinascreen at the facility. Cllr Elattar said she was glad to hear Cllr Cuddy would not vote against the proposal. “These pitches in Cahore are not fit for purpose. If you come up to see them, you could be up to your knees in water,” she said. “The soccer team has to travel sometimes to Dungiven to play matches because they cant actually use the pitches. “The money needs to be spent whether or not the lease goes ahead. The lease gives the clubs ownership and lets them apply for outside funding that will add to what these pitches offer.”  County Derry man disqualied after witnesses followed him home  The -year-old has been disqualied from driving.    Mickey left memories that will be cherished forever  The Ballinascreen man passed away last week.    Empty Rural College site could provide interim asylum accommodation, says MLA  The Alliance representative said she was astounded the building was still empty.

When Ann decided four years ago to take on a new challenge in the form of running, she knew Claire would be her biggest supporter. googletag.cmd.push You see, Claire is no stranger to running, having undertaken almost  marathons to date, including ultras and  hour running events, she was only too happy to share her experience with herolder sister. The twins celebrate their achievements. But that Sunday morning Ann would have to step out in The Deep RiverRock Belfast City Marathon without Claire by her side.. and it seems Claire was more nervous than Ann about that. Ann, who lives inMagherasaid: “I only started running in  when we lost our youngest sister, Julie. I was , about to turn  later that year. Swatragh playgroup ran a CK and I joined in with that, that led on to me wanting to run more.     “Claire has been the biggest inspiration, she was always giving me words of advice, evenshe didnt realise she was doing it.” So as Ann built up her miles, and their thbirthday approached, the twins planned a trip to celebrate. But this wouldnt be a holiday where they needed flip-flops, the pair of them packed their running shoes and Ann ran her very first half marathon on the morning of their birthday, in sunny Benidorm with proud twin sister Claire by her side. Claire pictured in London. Claire, who is a member of Ballymena Runners said: “We have done lots of firsts together. Anns first k was with me in Ballymena and we did the half marathon at .am on the morning of our birthday – that was an unofficial one, but I was also there when Ann undertook her first official one. That was in Derry, I was her pacer and she was the only person in the group to stay with me the entire way. “I will never forget it, over the Foyle bridge Ann was right on my heels, I was immensely proud that day.” So how come on Sunday, October  the sisters ended up running in dferent places  Claire, a Learning Support Assistant at St Patricks College Ballymena, explained: “I had every intention of running Belfast, I wanted to be there for Anns very first marathon, but I had got through to run London in  and a stress fracture ruled me out, so when I had the chance this time I was so happy to do it, and it honestly didnt disappoint.” Ann, who works in Crawfords in Maghera, said: “At the beginning I had little motivation running solo, so I started doing social runs with other people close to home, as well as track training. I train with Rosemary Hargan but I belong to Termoneeny running Club.” And when Ann decided she was entering the Belfast Marathon, Claire was only too happy to be her training partner. Ann said: “Claire did a good few training runs with me, she gave me lots of advice, but above all was to smile and enjoy every step which is exactly what I did. I wasnt nervous until I saw the starting line, then I got a message from Claire and knew she was thinking of me, it really relaxed me knowing she was rooting for me! With my phone in my pocket, it was like she was with me. “Its never about the times, I just wanted to finish the marathon. I had hit  miles at four hours and looked at my watch, wonderingClaire had finished yet.” Ann pictured after taking on the Belfast Marathon. Claire added: “I probably overloaded Ann with advice, but she is so laidback I worried she hadnt realised the mammoth task involved in training for a marathon. “Ann and I both have our set days for training and we dont sway too much from them, but we never ever miss the long runs. “We did a good few of them together, Id either go toMagheraor Ann would drive to Cloughmills, wed run  –  miles, but when we didnt run together Ann would tell me what she was doing and Id be messaging her to see how she got on. “On the morning of the marathon I messaged her from the start line, I genuinely couldnt feel any more proud. I was more worried about Ann than myself, I worried that shed get caught up in the crowds and have a struggle to finish. “When I crossed the line myself I phoned my husband, Damien, and he was in Belfast waiting on Ann coming in. I was so happy to know she had the support of him and her whole family, she knew I was there in spirit.” Ann concluded: “I felt so happy running myself and knowing Claire was fulfilling one of her dreams to run in the London marathon. “We have enjoyed so many runs together and I know we will enjoy many more – another marathon is definitely on the cards for me, so hopefully we can both be in the same place for it!” So what advice do the girls give to any budding runners  Or anyone that may think theyre too old to start running  Ann said: “I was nearly  when I started running, Id say do it for YOU, keep turning up, commit to your own training, dont compare yourself to another runner, everyone runs for dferent reasons – headspace, beating their own personal times, but my advice is to show up and do it for you.” Claire, who is also a Leader in Running Fitness at Ballymena Runners, added: “The best advice Id give anyone is to trust your training. The longer runs make you stronger as they build a resilience youll need in a marathon. Consistency is key, as is good nutrition, thats fuel for your body.” So as the two sisters recover and plan their next long run they both want to thank friends who offered support and encouragment to them both during their training, their running clubs and their families, who are all very proud of them both and think theyre an inspiration.

Claire added: “I probably overloaded Ann with advice, but she is so laidback I worried she hadnt realised the mammoth task involved in training for a marathon. “Ann and I both have our set days for training and we dont sway too much from them, but we never ever miss the long runs. “We did a good few of them together, Id either go toMagheraor Ann would drive to Cloughmills, wed run  –  miles, but when we didnt run together Ann would tell me what she was doing and Id be messaging her to see how she got on. “On the morning of the marathon I messaged her from the start line, I genuinely couldnt feel any more proud. I was more worried about Ann than myself, I worried that shed get caught up in the crowds and have a struggle to finish. “When I crossed the line myself I phoned my husband, Damien, and he was in Belfast waiting on Ann coming in. I was so happy to know she had the support of him and her whole family, she knew I was there in spirit.” Ann concluded: “I felt so happy running myself and knowing Claire was fulfilling one of her dreams to run in the London marathon. “We have enjoyed so many runs together and I know we will enjoy many more – another marathon is definitely on the cards for me, so hopefully we can both be in the same place for it!” So what advice do the girls give to any budding runners  Or anyone that may think theyre too old to start running  Ann said: “I was nearly  when I started running, Id say do it for YOU, keep turning up, commit to your own training, dont compare yourself to another runner, everyone runs for dferent reasons – headspace, beating their own personal times, but my advice is to show up and do it for you.” Claire, who is also a Leader in Running Fitness at Ballymena Runners, added: “The best advice Id give anyone is to trust your training. The longer runs make you stronger as they build a resilience youll need in a marathon. Consistency is key, as is good nutrition, thats fuel for your body.” So as the two sisters recover and plan their next long run they both want to thank friends who offered support and encouragment to them both during their training, their running clubs and their families, who are all very proud of them both and think theyre an inspiration.

Sinn Feacuteins Cllr Sean Bateson used a discussion on Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Councils Grant Funding Policy Review to raise a question on the funding of a NI centenary event held at the weekend. googletag.cmd.push The event, part-funded by the Council, featured a historical re-enactment of a B-Specials drill demonstration and checkpoint, described by a local SDLP MLA as isive and crass. The organising committee of the event issued a statement to say no Council funding had been used to fund the demonstration. Cllr Sean Bateson Cllr Bateson asked officials at the Leisure and Development Committee to clary no public money had been spent on it. “I would like to speak on . on item  and specically, the NI small grants fund,” said the representative for Bann. “Can I ask the director for clarity on the awarding of this grant and in relation to the grossly inappropriate and deeply insensitive event at Coleraine Town Hall at the weekend      “My community was disgusted at this event and the re-enactment featuring a military display of the B-Specials. “The history of the B-Specials speaks for itself. It was effectively established as the paramilitary wing of the Orange state and was designed to subjugate nationalists and republicans. “For nationalists and republicans, such an event yet again clearly illustrates that the centenary of partition is being used by certain quarters as a show of triumphalism. “Can the director clary and put on recordthis grant went towards the funding and display of this event and the group that was involved in it  “Can the director give me a breakdown of the total Council funding and what it went towards ” Cllr John McAuley Committee Chair, Cllr John McAuley, told Cllr Bateson his question was not related to the agenda item the Grant Funding Policy Review. “You are quite aware that this isnt even part of the agenda,” said the DUP representative. “You did attempt to put in an AORBwhich you were too late for, and now you have decided to try and slip it in to make a few headlines with your republican agenda. “I try not to rise to these sort of things, but its a case of offended by everything and ashamed of nothing. Cllr Bateson began to protest that it was in fact part of the agenda, but Cllr McAuley told him he would chair the meeting as I choose to chair it. “Im the Chair, so Ill speakI want to speak. As a proud son of a B-man, I will not be letting you try and take over this Committee tonight to whitewash history. “Ill chair the meeting as I choose to chair it,” he added. Cllr George Duddy Cllr George Duddy then called a point of order, stating thatCllr Bateson continually interrupted the Chair, the Committee could vote on point of order . that the member not be heard on this item. “When the Chair speaks during the debate, any member speaking at the time must stop and the meeting must be silent,” said the DUP councillor. “Im not sure that Cllr Bateson understands standing orders, but you have asked him on more than one occasion, which is your perogative, to cease speaking, and he has continued to interrupt. “If Cllr Bateson continues, I will call point of order . for a member not to be heard any longer.” “Go ahead Cllr Duddy, I think it shows your agenda,” replied Cllr Bateson. The Committee then voted in favour of the point of order intervention, with nine voting for, two against and three abstentions. It marks the second time in four weeks that a Sinn Feacutein councillor has been subject to point of order . and no longer permitted to speak on an item. Cllr Duddy also called the point of order on Glens councillor Cara McShane at a previous meeting of the Leisure and Development Committee. The incident arose after a fellow DUP councillor claimed Cllr McShane insinuated he was a fool.

Sinn Feacutein councillor denied permission to speak after fool comment  A point of order was called by DUP councillors Adrian McQuillan and William Duddy.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.         Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.         The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.         Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

She made the comments during a segment on her late night show, Claire Byrne Live, with former UKIP leader, Nigel Farage. The pro-Brexiteer questioned Irelands membership of the European Union and said, Why dont you ask yourselves in Dublin a question  Why did you fight the British for five hundred years - five hundred often very bloody, dficult years - until the s, what was the point of ityoure now governed by [sic]  googletag.cmd.push Mr Farage recently went viral for saying the Irish Republican phrase Up the Ra in a birthday greeting video, the meaning of which he stated he had no knowledge of. This was then raised by Ms Byrne, who played the clip and said, I want people to see just how much you know about the history and culture on this island. She continued: I know you said sorry, I know you get eighty seven quid and its entirely within your rights to do that, but come on, dont try to lecture the Irish people on the culture and history and precarious nature of peace on this island. You havent got a clue.     Mr Farage concluded by saying, Do you want to be an Independent democratic nature or governed by foreign bureaucrats  Thats the question that Ireland will ask itself. Those of you in the national media and national policies in Dublin will fight that as hard as you can because you will benefit financially.

The comments were made during a Government press conference on Tuesday October th, after the announcement of the countrysrevised reopening plan, where Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin confirmed all of the restrictions set to ease from Friday,  October and the restrictions that will remain in place. googletag.cmd.push The pandemic isnt over yet. Unfortunately, were going to have to get through at least another winter before we can safely say that its behind us, Varadkar said at the press conference. The situation took a turn for the worse about two or three weeks ago and since then, weve seen rising case numbers, rising hospitalisations and rising ICU numbers.So, were not where we hoped to be or expected to be for  October... were not past the peak of the Delta wave. Later in the press conference, he said the government would be meeting with unions and employer representatives to update the Work Safely Protocol.     Well have that done over the next couple of days and essentially what were saying is that a staggered and phasedto the office is possible, he explained. So, people going back to the office for a specic business purpose, like a meeting or a training, for example, or inductions - that is allowed. But certainly people who can work from home and want to continue to work from home, their employer should facilitate that. But bear in mind, there are also people whove been working from home with a laptop on a bed for  months now and they really want to get back to the office. Andthat can be facilitated,they can be in an office on their own or in an office where theyre socially distanced from other people, that should be facilitated too. But the fullto offices as we knew them, that will be next spring, added the Taacutenaiste. The announcement from the Taacutenaiste comes days after Deputy Chief Medical OfficerDr. Ronan Glynn advised the public towork from home where possiblethis autumn and winter.

The comments were made during a Government press conference on Tuesday October th, after the announcement of the countrysrevised reopening plan, where Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin confirmed all of the restrictions set to ease from Friday,  October and the restrictions that will remain in place. googletag.cmd.push The pandemic isnt over yet. Unfortunately, were going to have to get through at least another winter before we can safely say that its behind us, Varadkar said at the press conference. The situation took a turn for the worse about two or three weeks ago and since then, weve seen rising case numbers, rising hospitalisations and rising ICU numbers.So, were not where we hoped to be or expected to be for  October... were not past the peak of the Delta wave. Later in the press conference, he said the government would be meeting with unions and employer representatives to update the Work Safely Protocol.     Well have that done over the next couple of days and essentially what were saying is that a staggered and phasedto the office is possible, he explained. So, people going back to the office for a specic business purpose, like a meeting or a training, for example, or inductions - that is allowed. But certainly people who can work from home and want to continue to work from home, their employer should facilitate that. But bear in mind, there are also people whove been working from home with a laptop on a bed for  months now and they really want to get back to the office. Andthat can be facilitated,they can be in an office on their own or in an office where theyre socially distanced from other people, that should be facilitated too. But the fullto offices as we knew them, that will be next spring, added the Taacutenaiste. The announcement from the Taacutenaiste comes days after Deputy Chief Medical OfficerDr. Ronan Glynn advised the public towork from home where possiblethis autumn and winter.

The Verge hasreported that the site, which is worth nearly  billion as of last year,is planning to rebrand itself with a new name next week. It is understood that the site received the information from a source with direct knowledge of the matter. googletag.cmd.push Specically, the source claimed that Facebooks Chief Executive Officer, billionaire Mark Zuckerberg, plans to talk about the name change at the companys annual Connect conference on October . However, the source added that the new name could be unveiled sooner. In addition, the source claimed that the name change will signy the companys new mission to on expand the metaverse, which is believed to itsambition to be known for more than its social media presence. Previously, Zuckerberg told the site in July,that Facebook will effectively transition from people seeing us as primarily being a social media company to being a metaverse company over a number of years.     In response, Facebook said it does not comment on rumour or speculation. The rebranding would position Facebooks social media app as one of many products under a parent company, which will also oversee groups like Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus. Many news sites, including The Irish Independent and, as well as The Verge itself, have noted that therumours come at a time when the company is facing increasing US government scrutiny over its business practices. Earlier this month, a whistleblower named Frances Haugen leaked documents that showed that celebrities, politicians and high profile Facebook users were treated dferently by the company. Reports detailed that these leaks revealed that moderation policies were applied dferently, and in some cases not at all, to such accounts - a system known as XCheck . Another leak showed that Facebook was also facing a complex lawsuit from a group of its own shareholders. Soon after,Facebook and its subsidiaries, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Mapillary, and Oculus, became globally unavailable for a period of six to seven hours. A separate whistleblower and former data scientist for the company, Sophie Zhang, recently testied to the British parliament that the social media site is allowing authoritarian governments to manipulate political discourse.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDrugs seized in County Derry villages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSinn Feacutein member silenced after B Special event funding question overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices - Tuesday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey was laid to rest on Saturday Derry NewsKatrinaRainey: “alady of gold” overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMLA criticises isive and crass B Specials re-enactment in County Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  You havent got a clue - Presenter loses cool with former British MEP on Irish historyNational NewsYou havent got a clue - Presenter loses cool with former British MEP on Irish history overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry man charged with illegally trading in African elephant and sperm whale overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsPolice appeal for sightings of murdered County Derry man overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Rhonda McKean alleges spending nine hours waiting to be seen at Altnagelvin Hospital.A Western Trust spokesperson said: Due to patient confidentiality we wouldnt be responding to inidual casesLocal NewsWaterside woman with broken back claims nine-hour wait to be seen at Altnagelvin overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps.     Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall.

He creates dark ambient as An Trinse, lo-fi Techno as TFT and has the monthly show ‘First Trans- mission’ on Threads radio. He also works as a designer and animator who has created multi-disciplinary work for clients including Nike and Adidas.  What influences you  googletag.cmd.push “With the An Trinse project I’ve always thought of it as being indebted musically to the surrealism of Nurse with Wound and later Coil with a heavy dose of Irish history in there. “My techno records as TFT are much more straightforward and fit into the classic Dutch Clone Viewlex template or L.I.E.S. I’ve enjoyed handing over the visual side to Ben Lee who is an incredible designer. The current visual work with Maxwell Sterling stems from getting obsessed with Peter Greenway a long time ago and suddenly having an outlet for this baroque sensibility. “Max’s work is so rich and cinematic I was instantly inspired to find a way to create a version of the layered theatrical world of Prosperos Books mixed with images generated via AI with painterly elements and I think we have arrived at a pretty inidual visual soup.”     Any Irish stuff out there  “Some of my favourite Irish music of the last few years has come from the label Fort Evil Fruit, they have built up a formidable discography over the last decade across the spectrum of experimental sound. “Also, a big fan of From the Bogs of Aughuska as we share a love of the crossover of Irish History, drone, and black metal who I always thought deserved more attention, but I guess it’s a bit of a niche interest. “Recently been loving the unpronounceable Lighght from Cork who makes really eclectic danceable electronica”. How was your lockdown  “I can’t pretend I didn’t think it was the end of the world at the start but once we settled into the long-drawn-out boring apocalypse it has shaken up my work a bit. I was in great form, had just completed an An Trinse audio-visual show which premiered at one of CTM festival in Berlin’s associated events in January and was hoping to tour the projects throughout the year plus was in the process of setting up a celebratory gig for my split album with Il Santo Bevitore. “I had also just worked on the visual direction of the NME awards which was one of the biggest projects I had overseen. “That all went in the bin along with my main revenue source working as an editor and animator in the creative industry, so it was a very scary few months till everything stabilised a bit. I tried to use the time to collaborate with artists on music videos which crazily ended up helping on Kylie Minogue’s online show and directing a piece for Yousef and Gorgon City. “I also ended up exhibiting work in some online exhibitions which has led to my current work with the Most Dismal Swamp collective but there was a lot of staring at the wall wondering where it was all going. “Later in the year, I did some online gigs including a collaboration with Bratislavan artists Monika Subrtova which felt gooda little weird staring in a camera in an empty room. The project with Maxwell came out of lockdown as well, we were both working on a video project with architecture collective The Decorators who were similarly trying to find ways to show work when everyone is stuck in the house. “That project has just been shown at the V  A museum at the London Design Festival which was a bit of a dream come true.” New normal  “I’m hoping that the show me and Maxwell are doing at MIRA festival in Barcelona is the start of something positive for the new year. We were slightly shocked to get booked so early as we had so far only presented an embryonic version of the show once and was a bit of a disaster technically. “We have done one more show since and its light years ahead now and very excited about presenting it on m screens.”  Any music over there you’d recommend  “Well i would definitely say check out Max’s new album ‘Turn of Phrase’, I’m extremely excited about working on the live presentation and its without doubt one of the best albums of the year. “My pal Yaws is also putting out some wild bendy tempo electronics that you will struggle to pin down. “Also,anyone is interested in the world of digital art and experimental music, I would check out Clot magazine ran by my wonderful other half.” www.clotmag news performance-maxwell-sterling-stephen-mclaughlin-a-v-at-space--london  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dans Bar, Claudy  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsDrugs seized in County Derry villages overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSinn Feacutein member silenced after B Special event funding question overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeDerry Death Notices -

at half time.Downpatrick were desperately unlucky not to find the back of the net just minutes into the second half,as McGrady ran clear of the defenders after a looping ball over the topseemed to have caught Clonduff napping.With lsquokeeper Gribben already off his line, he made the decision to challenge McGrady in an aerial dual that the Downpatrick number  managed to win.However, his slapped effort over the head of the Clonduff custodian clipped back off the post and backinto the possession of the grateful Yellas.A minute later and the Hoops were back threatening the opposition defence, but Clonduff held firm when Branniganrsquos lsquorsquo effort dropped into the danger zone.Barry OrsquoHagan punished the Hoops for not taking their chances as his free sailed over the bar, before Downpatrickrsquos Oran Cunningham saw his effort drt wide at the other end.Charlie Carr extended his sidersquos lead with his second point of the game, although Tim Prenter managed to keep the RGU in touch with a no-nonsense score.McConville restored the margin with a left footed strike before his free pushed his side further in front.Darren OrsquoHagan showed no signs of slowing down as he began bossing play with piercing runs and cute passing, allowing the Yellas to put a foothold on the game.Doherty saw his free drt wide off the mark before Close punished the Hoops with a finely taken point to close out the action before the second water-break.Downpatrick knew the clock was against them, but they werenrsquot quite at panic station yet, as Brannigan converted yet another free after teammate Sean Bell was fouled.Clonduff midfielder Ross Carr pointed immediately after before Brannigan once more replied with a free.However, Darren OrsquoHagan began the move that would decide the match, after a string of neat passes and clever off the ball movement allowed his brother Barry to nip in behind the Downpatrick defence before calmly slotting home into the bottom right corner.The now six-point advantage truly seemed to deflate the Downpatrick side who now knew it would take something very special to force extra-time.Despite a Brannigan free, McConville wrapped up the scoring with a lovely left footed strike to ensure it was his Clonduff outfit who would enter the semi-final draw.This signalled the end of the road for the Downpatrick men, who gave a great account of themselves in this yearrsquos competition.Downpatrick: J Deeny, E Rooney , A Doherty, R Murphy, S Bell, J Bell, C Doherty , D Turley, C McCarron, T Prenter , G Collins, C McGrady , J Brannigan , O Cunningham, C Mooney.Subs: T Smyth, P Turley, A Og Robinson, M Fitzpatrick, T Louden, T McNeill, N Cunningham, D Brannf, T Savage, C Boyd, R Og Quinn, C Farrell, G Trainor.Clonduff: P Gribben, J OrsquoHagan, D OrsquoHagan, T McEvoy, L Branagan, C Carr , J Gribben, R Carr, A Carr , T Close , P OrsquoHagan, B OrsquoHagan , A McConville , S McConville, E Brown.Subs: N Trainor, C Brown, R Brannigan, S McGreevy, P Lively, R Lively, T McGreevy, B McConville, P Wilson, J Boden, M McPolin, K OrsquoHagan, F McConville..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Co.jpg","title":"Co Down Rural Community opens new hub in Newcastle  ","story":"THE Co Down Rural Community Network has opened a new wellbeing hub in Newcastle.The new facility is intended to be a central point in the resort to make it easier for people to access information, advice and support and participate in activities to improve their mental and physical health and wellbeing.It will work with iniduals, community members, local groups, and multi-disciplinary teamsto identy community needs and facilitate better access to mental health and wellbeing training and resources.The opening of the new hub is the culmination of the Community Network working with local GPs and primary care teams and the wider community for over  years.Over the past three years, the network has linked up with the MDTs in the local primary care practices.The network has a team of social prescribers and an MDT coordinator who take referrals from GP practices, pharmacists and from other sources and find solutions for people who may be affected by physical limitations or mental health issues or who simply feel isolated in their own homes.This work has intensied during the Covid pandemic, making the opening of the hub even more timely.A total of  people have been referred by the local GPs and their teams to the Community Network since January this year in addition to the  clients that the Social Prescribing team have been working with since .Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairwoman Cathy Mason, who officially opened the news hub on Monday, has described it as a ldquogreat asset for the Community Network team and those who formerly operated a connect and chat service.ldquoGroups of all sorts now have a base to operate from in a beautul and peaceful location.

The project manager Mr Mike Gibb, said Delamont had always been his first option but he could no longer afford to wait on the council.Mr Gibbrsquos announcement dashes hopes that the centre, which is destined to become the largest owl and birds of prey rescue facility in Europe, would come to Killyleagh.Mr Gibb had entered negotiations with Down Council last year regarding the possible construction of the sanctuary at Delamont.But the project became the subject of controversial debates within the council chamber earlier this year amid accusations that council officials were dragging their heels about the proposal, leading Mr Gibb to look for alternative locations.CLOUGH ndash Residents opposing plans for the erection of a BT Cellnet mobile telephone mast in Clough have formed an action group to try and block the plan.At a meeting in the village on Monday, residents got together after they heard local environmentalist, Walter Graham, outlined the drawbacks and health risks associated with these masts.Plans for the -metre mast which,approved, will be sited within the Watsonrsquos filling station complex, were published several weeks ago andaccepted could be operating within months.Up to  residents gathered in the Old School House, just a stonersquos throw from the proposed site, to hear of the risks and implications these masts are believed to cause.Villagers heard how the transmitter could dominate the skyline, towering over homes, a primary school, petrol station and an old peoplersquos home.Claiming that scientists believed the growth of cancers were ldquospurred on by the transmitters, he said. ldquoIf this mast goes up my children are coming out of school, there is no way they will study in the shadow of that mast.

The Trust told us recently that the urgent care centre is lsquomeeting the needs of the publicrsquo but one really has to wonder how this opinion has been formed, said Mrs Trainor.Appealing for increased investment at the Downe site, health campaigners say that the hospital has the capability to do much more.The say the hospitalrsquos bed capacity must be extended to help meet the needs of local communities but also to help address the regional beds shortage caused by the large cut in capacity across Northern Ireland ldquowhich has been brutally exposed during the Covid crisis.The campaigners added: ldquoThe South Eastern Trust should now be looking at a large extension to the hospital, creating new capacity, away from over congested centralised sites, levelling up rural inequality in healthcare provision.

I have a particular problem with butter balls. They are horrible, liable to crack your jaw and I remember a now long dearly departed aunt repeatedly sucking on them at church, and offering me one to sweeten a tedium I knew could only be endured with stony faced compliance.There is no amount of sexy or stylish or slick advertising, not even a nationwide campaign with Kate Moss sporting one between her teeth, that could bring back the butter ball in any way that would ever make it fashionable or appealing again to those beneath octogenarian status.

These burrows were once part of a huge dune system that stretched all the way from the River Ogmore to the Gower peninsula and this area along with Kenfig is classed as a Site of Special Scientic Interest.With the dogs racing ahead enjoying their adventure and freedom, the narrow sandy paths adorned in places by the pretty Michaelmas-daisy led them through the burrows before turning southwards towards the coast.Reaching Kenfig Sands where the tide was on the ebb there were fantastic views south westwards towards Jersey Marine, Swansea Bay, Mumbles and Gower beyond as they settled down utilising washed up tree trunks as seating for morning refreshments in warm sunshine with a welcome breeze.Returning onto the coast path above the beach the group made their way eastwards to reach Sker Point with its fantastic long-distance views back across Kenfig Sands, spoiled only by the industrial smoke and buildings of Port Talbot Steelworks.Following the coastline soon the yellow painted Sker House came into view which signalled their lunch stop overlooking Sker Rocks which was the setting on April , , when the Samtampa a former Liberty ship was making its way up the Bristol Channel towards Newport in a south westerly gale. Developing an engine fault, the captain dropped anchor so repairs could begin, but the weather worsened to hurricane force winds, the ship slipped its anchor and was driven onto Sker Rocks. Mumbles leboat was launched to try to save the crew, but the Samtampa began to break up and all  of its crew drowned, along with the eight volunteer crew members of the Mumbles leboat which was later found upside down and smashed to pieces.     Continuing along the coast path with views across Rest Bay to Locks Common in Porthcawl and reaching the western perimeter of the Royal Porthcawl Golf Club, they ventured inland following a narrow path between fences, with a field of beautul Welsh Black cattle as the heat rose, before an open field brought them through a gate into Nottage.A short journey along the busy and fast-moving West Road brought them to a rough track opposite Parc Newydd Farm, which led them to overlook the impressive, imposing and dramatic Grade One listed Sker House, which was originally founded by the Cistercian monks of Neath as one of five farms or granges to support Neath Abbey. The house was remodelled by the Turberville family in the mid-th century after which it was tenanted and then sold to the Williams family in the late th century.This was when the romantic, heart rendering story of the lsquoMaid of Skerrsquo began involving Elizabeth Williams, an attractive young lady who loved to dance in the old Town Hall above the Prince of Wales Inn at Kenfig, where the music was supplied by a harpist.One evening the harpist was Thomas Evans and upon meeting they were smitten and fell in love. For a while he courted her, but her father was against the union as he felt being the daughter of a successful landowner and farmer, Thomas Evans was beneath her as he was a mere carpenter and so he imprisoned her in Sker House.The couple tried to elope, but their plans were thwarted and until Elizabeth agreed to marry her fatherrsquos choice of husband - Thomas Kirkwood of Neath - she was not freed. They married and had four children settling in Briton Ferry, but it was an unhappy liaison andher true love was playing in the area, Elizabeth would sneak out to hear him play. She died in , it is said of a broken heart, and was buried at Llansamlet, but her unfulfilled and unhappy ghost is said to still walk at Sker.Following a track and crossing part of the Pyle and Kenfig golf course brought them back to their start point after what had been a delightful scenic and interesting tramp through history in stunning weather for the month of October.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We have had great success with online bridge during the pandemic, but now we have reopened for Face-to-Face bridge our numbers are too small to be viable.Please come and support this historic club. However, letrsquos be positive. We are exploring merging our Tuesday and Friday evening sessions with another club.And,all fails, we will resume online bridge. Penarth Bridge Club will live on!So, here is a recent hand played at a Face-to-Face session where careful judgment by both declarer and the defence were required to achieve the optimum result.The AuctionNorth had seven spades and just seven points, ideal for a pre-emptive opening of three spades. The aim of pre-emptive bids is to put a spanner in the wheel of the defence.However, the danger always is that, as here, your partner has a good hand and so has a dficult decision to make on whether to pass or bid on for game. After some thought, South could see at least six spade tricks, evenhis partner did not have the king of spades.There were also two certain heart tricks, and it ought to be possible to rustle up a trick in diamonds and one more from Northrsquos hand. So, South bid four spades.The playTrick  ndash East was on lead and did not fancy a diamond or a club. And the jack of hearts lead was fraught with danger. So, interestingly, East chose to lead the five of spades, reasoning that his king was safe for a trickNorth held the ace.     And evenSouth held three spades to the ace, North must surely have an entry somewhere to take the spade finesse. Anyway, declarer paused to consider the hand.Without the trump lead the contract would have been secure as he could have ruffed a losing club in dummy. But now things were dficult.North decided to play the ace of spades, hoping to drop a singleton king in Westrsquos hand. But no luck. Tricks  and  ndash Declarer then played a club to his ace, followed by a small club from hand, the trick being won by Eastrsquos king.East was now quite pleased he had decided to lead a trump at the first trick. Trick  - East won the next trick with the king of spades, preventing declarer from ruffing his losing club.Trick  ndash East then led his ace of diamonds, which was ruffed by declarer in hand. Trick  ndash Declarer drew Eastrsquos last trump with his queen, discarding a heart from dummy. But he could now see he still had a losing club and a losing heart, one down, having already lost two tricks.But could there be a squeeze on  Tricks , ,  and  ndash Declarer then rattled off his last four spades, forcing four discards from both East and West. East could see that dummy had to discard before West, so he jettisoned his remaining four diamonds, keeping the jack of clubs and two hearts.Declarer decided to discard one more heart and the rest of dummyrsquos diamonds. West had to hope his partner East held the jack of clubs, otherwise he was genuinely squeezed. So, he discarded the rest of his clubs, keeping his three hearts to the queen.Declarer then played a small heart to dummyrsquos ace. He followed this with the king of hearts. Bad luck, Eastrsquos jack dropped but not Westrsquos queen. Trick  - West then won the last trick with his queen of hearts, declarer only making nine tricks - six spades, two hearts, and one club, one down for a loss of  points.Four spades was a perfectly reasonable bid by South. But well done by the defence for the opening lead and care in their discards.What have we learnt . areful judgement is needed when responding to partnerrsquos opening pre-emptive bid, particularly when non vulnerable, since the pre-emptive bid is likely to be quite weak..

NormandierCouncillor Neil Thomas, a former governor at Evenlode, said: ldquoOne problem was the transition from Bute Cottage to Evenlode, because Bute Cottage was using dferent reading and numeracy schemes from Evenlode. It was a source of irritation for the reception teachers that they had to basically reteach the children to fit into the new schemes.ldquoThis change should improve that situation, because yoursquore not going to get that conflict of schemes.ldquoTherersquos a lot of misinformation going around, and therersquos a lot on social media saying that the Bute Cottage site is going to be closed and developed, and the open area next to it is going to become a building site. None of which is referred to in this report and all of which has been denied.ldquoTheyrsquore alleging that there are plans to move Bute Cottage physically and rebuild it on the grounds of Evenlodemdashagain that is something expressly ruled out. But thatrsquos something being put out on social media, and Irsquom wonderingthatrsquos for political reasons to stir up anxiety and worry among the community. There are no such plans in place.As part of the public consultation, a cabinet report was published describing the merger plans in detail. According to Cllr Gordon Kemp, chair of the scrutiny committee, some of the concerns could be caused by people not reading that -page report in full.He said: ldquoI think part of the problem with the original cabinet report was the reference that they would remain in the same buildings was tucked away in the report. It wasnrsquot there right at the beginning, and perhaps some people donrsquot read as far as they should, unfortunately.However, the cabinet report, towards the end, discussed how the council would indeed consider relocating the nursery. It said: ldquoShould the proposals be approved, the council would prioritise relocating nursery provision at Evenlode Primary School onto a single site.The report added the council would first assess the feasibility of the relocation, and would then also consult the public before any changes.Cllr Lis Burnett, cabinet member for education and regeneration, denied there were any plans to relocate the nursery. But she added the council would ldquoprobably exploreit were possible.She said: ldquoThere are no plans to change the sites of either the nursery schools. There is a small section in the consultation document that says that there would be feasibility work undertaken to see whether or not there should be a move over to the Evenlode site. Itrsquos one of those things where yoursquore damnedyou do and damnedyou donrsquot.ldquoIf we hadnrsquot put anything in and somebody had said lsquowhat are you going to do about moving to one sitersquo, we would say wersquoll probably do some feasibility work on it to see whether or not itrsquos an option. Butwe put it in, then itrsquos a done deal. Itrsquos not a done deal.ldquoI really donrsquot know how you could build a separate nursery on the Evenlode site, but thatrsquos my personal view. Butthat feasibility work proved that it were possible, then you would have to go right the way back to another consultation. This is purely about amalgamating management and governance s within the schools.The consultation runs until November  and details of the plans can be found on the councilrsquos website. If approved, the mergers would take effect from September . The two nurseries are currently some of the last remaining standalone nurseries across the Vale. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I had nothing to anchor my le against ndash I was just drting.ldquoI didnrsquot know what I was pushing so hard for or why. What did I want from le  What was important to me  I had no idea.Ms Hall, who has three daughters ndash aged , , and one ndash began to lose interest in herself and others and stopped taking care of herself she isolated herself and drank too much alcohol, trying to hide from le.She was getting ill but thought it would pass. Despite having a panic attack so severe she thought it was a heart attack and calling an ambulance she didnrsquot ask for help.By , at the age of , she hit ldquorock bottom ndash she was emotionally numb, she couldnrsquot be bothered to shower or get dressed.ldquoI didnrsquot really know what I wanted from le, so had no compass, said Ms Hall.ldquoI wasnrsquot taking enough time to look after myself and got caught up in the pressures of work to the extent that they became all consuming.     Ms Hall is in a better place mentally now and is a self-development coach and speaker. Two years after her breakdown, she set up her own business, ran the London Marathon to raise money for the charity Mind and she is a volunteer director for Mind Cymru.She also started writing as a cathartic exercise but, upon realising she could help others, decided to write a book: Making Sense of Me: Nothing Changes Until I Change - A Guide to a Resilient Le at Home and at Work.ldquoThe book is a combination of my personal story and insights from neuroscience to help people cope with, manage and bounce back from burnout, said Ms Hall.ldquoI still have my ups and downs, like anyone , but I feel like I am the one in charge of me. I still get tired and fed up, but the dference now is that I know when Irsquom reaching the tipping point between wellness and illness.ldquoI know when I need to stop and restore my energy levels. I have learnt that health and self-care come first. Without that nothing  happens anyway.Ms Hall now takes time to be mindful and enjoy time with her daughters. She values her loved ones more than ever before and ndash although shersquos still passionate about her work ndash knows ldquowhen it has to come second.OTHER NEWS:ldquoI donrsquot derive my sense of achievement and wellbeing from others anymore ndash I get that from me, said Ms Hall.ldquoI hope people who read my book know that it is okay not to be okay whoever you are and whatever your circumstances.ldquoDonrsquot let pride or fear of failure prevent you from taking action to help yourself. You need to understand who you are before you can change anything my book talks about awareness, acceptance, and action.ldquoIf you understand yourself ndash who you are and why you respond to le the way you do ndash then you can choose to change and respond dferentlyyou want to.ldquoI had the choice to stay where I was or get better: I chose to get better.ldquoThank you to anyone who reads the book. I hope it helps one or more people ndash I had to hit a wall to get help, but you donrsquot have to do that!Making Sense of Me: Nothing Changes Until I Change - A Guide to a Resilient Le at Home and at Work is available at Grfin Books in Penarth and online via Amazon.Itrsquos had positive feedback which you can read at https:amzn.to vqNVbuGet involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
