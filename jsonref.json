I believe the legalisation of drugs would lead to even more widespread abuse than exists now. More broken and unhappy lives. Probably more deaths.And we may be sure that the people who would experience the most deleterious effects of legalisation would not be the prosperous middle-classes but the marginalised and the most vulnerable.         Anyone found with a \u0027modest\u0027 amount would not be arrested or fined, let alone sent to prison. Offenders wouldn\u0027t acquire a criminal record. Instead, they would be given the chance to get help for their drug use (Pictured middle, Sarah Wollaston)Underlying the Committee\u0027s report is a dangerous misconception, which is shared by almost everyone advocating the decriminalisation of drugs. It is that we have a punitive drugs policy. We don\u0027t.It is true that in theory you can get a seven-year jail sentence for the possession of Class A drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine, and up to five years for possession of Class B drugs such as cannabis. But in practice such extreme penalties are seldom, if ever, applied.Indeed, some police forces have given up prosecuting people who smoke the stuff. Five, including Durham and Surrey, have announced, without any apparent shame, that they will turn a blind eye to cannabis for personal consumption.This is despite the fact that smoking it is illegal, and the existence of a growing mountain of evidence that repeated use of the more extreme forms of cannabis such as \u0027skunk\u0027 can cause schizophrenia and other forms of psychosis.And it\u0027s not just possession which the police ignore. Devon and Cornwall Constabulary discovered 194 cannabis farms in a four-year period but brought charges against only 79 suspects. Cannabis factories with specialist heating in West Yorkshire, Suffolk, Essex and Kent have also been spared.The authorities take a harder line against suppliers of Class A drugs but increasingly let off users. For example, Avon and Somerset police have introduced a scheme allowing people caught with heroin or crack cocaine to choose between prosecution and an education programme.         Five police forces, including Durham and Surrey, have announced, without any apparent shame, that they will turn a blind eye to cannabis for personal consumption (stock image)One only has to imagine the average middle-class consumer of hard drugs. Does he or she ever have the remotest fear of being caught and charged by the police? Of course not — unless another more serious crime has been committed at the same time.So despite all the liberal angst about our supposedly draconian failed drug policies (seemingly shared by the Health and Social Care Committee), the fact is we have a remarkably easy-going regime.Many of those proposing decriminalisation claim it is the only way of reducing drug-related crime. Why not try another approach that has scarcely been explored — namely, robustly applying the law against drug abuse? Oh, that would be too much of a challenge.So the would-be reformers instead recommend that a door which is already much more than slightly ajar should be thrown wide open. The likely outcome would be increased use of drugs, particularly among the poor and deprived.In Portugal, which is held up by the report as an exemplar of the effective control of drugs, the national drugs agency released figures in 2017 showing that the number of people using cannabis has risen by more than 40 per cent since decriminalisation in 2001.Moreover, the widespread abuse of prescription opioids in the United States suggests that the easy availability of hard drugs tends to increase consumption. Hundreds of thousands of people there — and an increasing number in this country — are hooked on them.         The authorities take a harder line against suppliers of Class A drugs but increasingly let off users (stock image) According to the American Journal of Public Health, deaths in 2016 from opioids dished out by medics were 50 a day using what is described as a \u0027conservative\u0027 method of analysis, and 89 a day employing what is termed a \u0027traditional\u0027 approach. That\u0027s close to an epidemic.In all likelihood, the legalisation of Class A drugs in this country would lead to more deaths and more wretchedness as they became freely obtainable without the stigma of breaking the law.Sensible people would for the most part avoid them out of fear of addiction, but the feckless and the susceptible — and doubtless some young people in an experimental phase — would be drawn to them in greater numbers.The MPs\u0027 Health and Social Care Committee might retort that it is not recommending full legalisation — at least not yet. But I repeat my contention that the decriminalisation of possession would probably lead in due course to full legalisation.Members of the Committee would also do well to take a closer look at Portugal, where strictly speaking all drugs, other than alcohol and tobacco, remain illegal. If you are found with illicit drugs in that country, whether hard or soft, you are meant to be arrested and taken to a police station. If the amount is above a certain threshold, you should be charged, and can be sent to prison.Should the amount of drugs be small, you are supposed to be sent to the Commission for the Dissuasion of Drug Addiction, and interviewed by a psychologist or social worker before appearing in front of a three-person panel which will offer suggestions aimed at stopping your drug use.All in all, this regime seems in many respects tougher than the lax one we have here. I can\u0027t imagine an average cannabis or cocaine user in Britain relishing being examined by a panel.No doubt improved care of addicts in this country would be a step forward so long as it was not accompanied by a green light approving their use of a banned substance.I don\u0027t suppose the recommendations of a lone Commons Committee will be taken all that seriously. But they are undoubtedly part of a growing campaign to legalise not just so-called soft drugs but hard ones, too.Let the police and courts better apply the laws we already have. It\u0027s not going to be easy, of course. But that\u0027s no reason for not attempting it. The unfettered availability of dangerous drugs would be a social nightmare."},{"url":null,"title":"Sew Bayeux Tapestry WASNT meant us","story":"Share this article But new analysis of the linen strips on which it is embroidered suggests that it was intended to hang there from the moment it was made.The discovery proves that the designer must have visited Bayeux and known the nave’s exact dimensions, adjusting the design accordingly.The findings shed new light on how the artwork, depicting one of history’s most famous legends, should be displayed ahead of its loan to the UK.

By studying the cathedral’s surviving architectural features, Prof Norton also established how the nave would have looked in the 11th CenturyThat enabled him to establish the nave’s original proportions by pinpointing the choir screen’s location - the Tapestry would have fitted five bays of the nave, with the artwork’s ‘narrative’ structured in relation to doorways and architectural supports.Professor Norton recommends that the Tapestry, currently kept in a long U-shaped tunnel, should be displayed along three sides of a rectangular space (31.15 m long x 9.25 m wide).He says that would evoke the original architectural setting, and enable viewers to appreciate the artwork as intended.The epic embroidery is set to be lent to Britain for the first time in recorded history, following a promise made by French President Emmanuel Macron last year.

If I\u0027ve been out, I get people asking why I\u0027m not working tonight.\u0027     Pauline said she would do \u0027anything\u0027 for customers and recalled a time where someone said she felt \u0027intimidated by some youngsters\u0027 and couldn\u0027t enter the store.To help her, Pauline delivered the food to her outside so she wouldn\u0027t have to come in.The customer\u0027s reaction touched Pauline, as she recalled: \u0027She thanked me very much. She sent a letter to say thank you.\u0027The next time she came in, she gave me a box of chocolates which meant a lot for me.\u0027 The 68-year-old also revealed her favourite food at KFC is either popcorn chicken or a chicken zinger burger. The store\u0027s general manager, Alice Yarde, said she\u0027s known Pauline ever since she started working at KFC in 1992.She said: \u0027I just think she\u0027s a treasure. I cannot imagine a day being here without her.\u0027I know obviously I will be one day. But when I first started here, she was my second mum.\u0027If I have any problems, Pauline is always someone I would be able to talk to.\u0027         Customers say Pauline\u0027s smile and friendly banter are what keeps them coming backAlice praised Pauline for her customer service and how she always seems to know what the customer wants to order.She said: \u0027You need to see her with the customers to see how good she is and how she is with customers.\u0027Pauline knows (what they would order) and you think of how many people she serves, she will know.\u0027Alice recalled: \u0027Before I went on a first date with my husband, I asked Pauline \u0027is that boy alright, what do you think?\u0027 because she knows everyone in Taunton. She said \u0027yeah he\u0027s alright\u0027.\u0027Pauline interjected with: \u0027I was serving on the till and he said \u0027I fancy that woman and I want to take her out\u0027.\u0027I said \u0027don\u0027t talk to me, speak to the young lady there!\u0027. She was so shy and they later got together and got married.\u0027Alice called Pauline her \u0027second mum\u0027 and said their shifts together are always fun.\u0027We just have a laugh\u0027, she said.\u0027It\u0027s not the easiest job in the world and we don\u0027t work the greatest hours but if we\u0027re working with good people and having banter with the customers, time flies and it\u0027s just good fun.\u0027Alice said her colleagues \u0027just adore her\u0027 and \u0027love working with Pauline\u0027 and everyone sees her as a \u0027second mum\u0027.\u0027Some young lads who normally would not be that responsive to the older generation, they would say \u0027Pauline what can I get for you\u0027 or \u0027let me make your tea\u0027 and they are just lovely.

It was quite eerie, almost scary. Even for her that moment was crazy’ Rihanna’s French fans are wild. They love her so much and they run for several blocks behind her car when she’s travelling through the city. This shot was taken at Paris fashion week in 2014. It was the first day she arrived in Paris and so things were especially intense.We’d just left the Balmain show and it was really hard to get through this huge crowd of people to the car. When we got inside we were instantly surrounded by people. If you look closely, one of the fans outside has their phone set to record mode – I don’t think you can actually see anything through the glass but they’re still trying. It was quite eerie, almost a little scary. Rihanna is more used to these kinds of situations than other people, but even for her that moment was kind of crazy.Before I met Rihanna I was fascinated by her as a pop star and as a person. She seemed very bold, very authentic and very fun. Before the Diamonds world tour in 2013 she asked me to come along and capture what happens between concerts. We got along well, so we kept working together. She already had a book in mind when we met, and that’s what we’ve spent the last six years doing. This shot was one of the key images for it. She didn’t want it to feature anything posed or set up – she wanted it to capture her life out of her eyes. So even on red carpets with a lot of paparazzi I would have to try to find a fresh angle – maybe include the photographers in the shot, or show a different perspective.Obviously, as a photographer, Rihanna is the best subject you can ask for. She’s very comfortable in front of the camera. The key thing was building a relationship with her. I can kind of feel her mood to know when it’s the right time to shoot, and what kind of pictures she would like. You don’t want to interrupt her workflow. She’s so dedicated to the cause, whatever she does: make up, music, styling. She will not ever do anything she doesn’t believe in. She works crazy hours. It’s awesome to witness.When you spend 24 hours a day with someone – on a jet, on a bus – you become very close. But it was always important that I knew my assignments and remained professional. I would go to an after party with her but maybe go home at 2am and start editing pictures.Rihanna’s very aware of the people around her and she helps them grow with her. Working with her has helped my career in every way. I’ve got to shoot people you would normally never get to shoot. I’ve got pictures of Rihanna and Karl Lagerfeld together – the access has been incredible. It’s also presented me with lots of challenges. When you’re shooting in a studio you get to dictate everything that’s going to happen on your set. But on tour, when you’re taking a picture at 4am with no light and you can’t use a flash, the situation dictates what sort of photo you can take. It really challenges you to get a good picture.Luckily, there is a trust between us. I think she felt OK to show a side to her that she might not show to other people or photographers.• Rihanna is published by Phaidon, £120.Training: I learned myself, from working with all kinds of amazing photographers.Influences: “Peter Lindbergh is the main one – he grew up in the same town and was always the person I look up to.”Low point: “When I started in 2007 there was a recession in the US. It was a very hard time to be a new photographer.”Top tip: “Be true to yourself. Don’t look at what trends are happening. Your perspective is unique to you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e48ce4e47d7c5250256b33af03341edd2ce8bbd7/65_568_1094_656/master/1094.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d874bfc9560475406b88e7e9ade56d7b","title":"down with god how the soviet union took on religion in pictures","story":"Marx said religion was the opium of the people – and in the Soviet Union, atheism became government policy, enforced by the state and encouraged by anti-religious posters and magazines.

They have remained close to the original format started by the writer René Goscinny and cartoonist Albert Uderzo, who mentored both Conrad and Ferri.However, the creation of Adrenaline is a big leap away from the femme fatales who usually turn up in the Asterix comics.“We didn’t want to develop a character who would be based on her seductive side as we usually do with female characters in Asterix. Most of the time they are young attractive women who seduce Obelix and their role stops there,” Conrad said.In the latest book, Asterix and Obelix must protect Adrenaline, who is being hunted down by the Romans, while also being confronted by the intergenerational gap between them and the young chieftain’s daughter.“In terms of the vocabulary it was quite amusing because I had to create a sort of teenage language for the time. We don’t have a lot of documentation about that. So the idea was to use certain expressions like teenagers do,” said Ferri.The Asterix books have become a mainstay in the publishing industry, with more than 370m copies sold worldwide.Five million copies of the French edition of Asterix and the Chieftain’s Daughter have been printed, with 2m of those remaining in France where new Asterix books frequently top the bestseller charts.As well as being translated into more than 100 languages, the books have inspired a dozen movies and cartoon series, making it a global phenomenon."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e473d9e68dffa89b1a48cd9d94be4e547ad410bf/12_43_3463_2078/master/3463.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c7d595fc6dd2d8e146705012db0b6d8","title":"rbs posts quarterly loss after extra 900m put aside for ppi claims","story":"Bank slid to an operating loss of £8m for the three months to SeptemberRoyal Bank of Scotland has swung to a quarterly loss after being forced to put aside an extra £900m to cover a surge in payment protection insurance complaints before the claims deadline.The extra charge means RBS slid to an operating loss of £8m for the three months to September, compared with a profit of £961m in the same quarter last year.PPI has become by far the banking industry’s biggest mis-selling scandal and this latest charge for RBS is at the top end of its estimates in September, after the August claims deadline.The bank had forecast a third-quarter provision of between £600m to £900m.The RBS finance director said it was too soon to say this was the end of the PPI saga, given the volume of claims the lender was still working through. “I think it would be very brave … to say the line was completely drawn under it but this is certainly our best estimate,” Katie Murray said.Despite the third-quarter losses, RBS said it remained on track for full-year expectations in uncertain times.The economic outlook forced RBS to take a £55m charge, but Murray said the “slight strain” was due to more than just Brexit jitters. She said it reflected deteriorating global growth forecasts in recent months, as well as ongoing volatility.“The economic indicators have got that much worse since the end of June,” she said. “It really is sort of the growing volatility in the economics that we see rather than something politically tied towards Brexit, I think it’s important to have the separation.”The lender said it was on track to cut costs by £300m by the end of the year, but Murray refused to speculate on the future of RBS’ investment bank, NatWest Markets, which suffered a £193m loss for the quarter.“As for job cuts, you know we always prefer to talk to our own staff, before we spoke externally.”The figures are the last for the chief executive, Ross McEwan, who hands over to Alison Rose next week. Rose, who has been with the bank for 27 years, will become the first woman to head a British high street bank.She is the deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings, RBS’s retail and commercial banking ision, and also runs RBS’s commercial and private banking business, including Coutts.Rose is expected to deliver a new strategic plan for the entire bank in February.

He also confirms that Christine Lagarde attended today’s meeting, ready to take over when Draghi leaves on 31 October.Mario Draghi has arrived for his final press conference as ECB president. You can watch it live here.Berenberg Bank have created four charts showing Mario Draghi’s performance.They say he was a ‘star performer’ at ending the eurozone crisis through his policy measures and verbal commitments......an ‘outperformer’ on job creation, as his expansive monetary policy encouraged firms to hire staff....It’s nearly time for Mario Draghi’s last press conference as head of the European Central Bank, after an eventful eight year stint.Kit Juckes of Societe Generale says Draghi certainly did it ‘his way’. But the job of reviving the eurozone economy is not finished. He leaves with the job of reviving the economy unfinished, and as he hands over the monetary baton to Christine Lagarde she might as well use it to beat up finance ministers and campaign for Europe’s fiscal ‘rules’ to be thrown into the Rhine. If she can do that, the euro will recover if she can’t, it is likely to struggle, rising against the dollar only when that falls across the board.Nick Wall of Merian Global Investors agrees that Lagarde will have lots to do:Draghi’s now famous “whatever it takes” moment saved the Eurozone by finally allowing the ECB to become a credible lender of last resort, a key facet for any central bank. Sovereign spreads have converged ever since, allowing for the odd political wobble, with Draghi’s ECB loaning money to banks, buying up sovereign and corporate debt, and taking interest rates below zero.The inflation objective during his tenure has not been met, perhaps a near-impossible task given the scale of deleveraging in the Eurozone and challenging demographic trends. But his legacy is the survival of the euro during its toughest test to-date using methods that were previously anathema to a central bank steeped in the traditions of the Bundesbank.The baton now passes to the venerable Christine Lagarde who faces a different set of challenges. An open economy like the Eurozone is highly exposed to the vagaries of global trade and political instability – the European growth model of high savings is dead in a trade war. Europe can no longer afford for the ECB to remain “the only game in town” without risking recession, so Lagarde’s task will be to encourage governments to take a more active fiscal policy stance to increase domestic demand. With investors willing to lend to governments, whether its Germany or Greece, at negative interest rates, it should be achievable – but it will represent a sea change for many European governments, requiring all of Lagarde’s political acumen.Neil MacKinnon of VTB Capital is concerned that the ECB Governing Council is split over the future direction of monetary policy. “Whatever it takes” can no longer be the ECBs modus operandi under Christine Lagarde. ECB hawks are concerned that a further drift into negative rate territory would hasten “Japanification” while a significant expansion in the ECB’s balance sheet is the road to debt monetisation. In the interim, the German economic slump is dragging the rest of the eurozone into recession and disinflation.It will be less about what monetary policy can do so negative rates will gradually come off the agenda, the emphasis will be more on bank restructuring and recapitalization...balance sheet expansion will become more gradual with more of an emphasis on fiscal expansion.”The European Central Bank has also confirmed that it will restart its stimulus programme on 1 November.As announced last month, it will buy €20bn of bonds with newly created money each month, until growth and inflation are back on target.The Governing Council expects the purchases to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of its policy rates, and to end shortly before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates.Newsflash: Mario Draghi has signed off his final meeting as ECB president, by leaving interest rates at all-time lows.The ECB also warns that rates may not rise for some time:Today’s disappointing results show that Twitter’s momentum in recent quarters has cooled, says eMarketer Senior Analyst Jasmine Enberg:She explains that this could be a bad sign for the current quarter, especially given the problems at its advertising arm:“Despite the continued double-digit growth in monetizable daily active users (mDAUs), Twitter missed on revenue.The miss wasn’t just because of tough comparisons, which were expected to dampen their revenue growth, but issues with their ad product. That could impact their performance in the all-important Q4.”Central bank news: Turkey has just cut interest rates by a chunky 250 basis points.That’s a much bigger cut to the one-week repo rate than expected. It follows signs that Turkish inflation is being tamed, as the damage caused by last year’s currency crisis fades, and the lifting of US sanctions.Newsflash: Social network Twitter has missed revenue and earnings forecasts, sending its stock sliding in pre-market trading.Net income also shrank too, coming in at $37 compared with adjusted net income of $106m a year ago.Twitter has blamed “revenue product issues” -- technical problems that messed up its advertising services. It also pointed to “greater-than-expected seasonality” -- apparently there were fewer big events to tweet about than last summer....Twitter grew its base of “average monetizable daily active usage” was 145 million, compared to 124 million a year ago. The challenge, though, seems to be actually monetizing them!Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s CEO, says the company is doing a good job cleaning up its service from trolls and other malign forces:Germany’s jobs market has been the envy of the eurozone for years. But that may be changing. Today’s PMI reports show that firms cut staff for the first time since 2013, as they reeled from a sharp drop in new orders. Factory staffing levels fell at the sharpest rate in a decade, as firms ditched temporary and contract workers.Cathal Kennedy and Megum Muhic of Royal Bank of Canada are concerned by the lack of improvement in today’s PMI survey. They told clients:The drop in employment was consistent with signs of easing capacity pressures with firms reducing backlogs of work at the quickest pace in 7 years. Meanwhile business sentiment fell to the lowest since November 2012.The combination of contracting new orders, easing capacity pressures and increased pessimism on future expectations points to further job losses in the months ahead. We have been highlighting for some time the risks of the labour market turning, especially in Germany, and the latest PMIs show this risk taking holdHere’s our news story on this morning’s poor PMI data:New groundbreaking analysis released today has shown how corrupt super-wealthy people are funnelling dirty cash into the UK.Transparency International UK has analysed more than 400 money laundering and corruption cases. It uncovers how ultra-expensive homes, expensive cars and jets, luxury goods, and private school fees are being paid for with ill-gotten gains.Nearly 600 UK businesses and organisations have received suspect funds, from schools and universities to architects and interior design firms -- either knowingly or unknowingly.Daniel Bruce, their CEO, says “a range of rogues including former presidents, prime ministers and senior public officials who have been caught with their fingers in the till” are taking advantage of the UK establishment.My colleague Rupert Neate has read the report, and explains:Research by Transparency International, an anti-corruption campaign group, found more than £300bn of suspect funds have been funnelled through the UK banks, law firms and accountants before being spent on a £1m Cartier diamond ring, masterpiece art works from Sotheby’s, and a £50,000 Tom Ford crocodile-skin jacket with matching crocodile-skin handbag from Harrods.The suspect cash – which often comes from corrupt officials’ embezzlement of hundreds of millions of pounds from poor countries’ state coffers – was also found to have been spent on a £200,000 Bentley Bentayga driven by the 22-year-old son of the former prime minister of Moldova. His father, Vlad Filat, had been sentenced to nine years in prison for his role in the “theft of the century”.Here’s his story:Here’s the full report: AT YOUR SERVICEAnders Svendsen of Nordea Markets fears that the eurozone economy is at risk of recession:The decline in Germany’s private sector has alarmed economists, who fear that Europe’s largest economy is weakening.Katharina Utermöhl of Allianz fears that Germany will be at risk of recession in 2020 (it may have already entered one this summer).Here’s her take on Germany’s composite PMI coming in at just 48.6, showing a contraction:The subdued outlook for global trade and the car industry as well as lingering elevated political uncertainty surrounding trade and Brexit are still weighing too heavily on Germany’s industry.

Here are some of the worst offendersWhen I was a kid, my dad stopped the car at every historical marker on our family vacations. He thought he was educating us. But too often these markers were telling us things that never happened and leaving out important things that did. Here’s a quick tour of 10 of the worst historic sites in the US.In Almo, Idaho, a slab of stone carved into the shape of Idaho memorializes a shocking incident in the history of the west: “Dedicated to the memory of those who lost their lives in a horrible Indian massacre, 1861. Three hundred immigrants west bound. Only five escaped.”The only problem with this marker is that 300 immigrants were not killed in 1861. Thirty were not three were not. It never happened at all. A fine western historian, Brigham Madsen, devoted years of research to showing that this event could not have happened. Why, then, does the marker stay up? Well, it’s the biggest thing that ever happened in Almo, even though it never happened!At the lower tip of Manhattan stands a granite portrayal of a nearly naked Native American, a clothed and befrocked Dutchman, and about $24 worth of beads. It marks the exact spot where this famous purchase of Manhattan never took place. A moment’s thought makes obvious that this story is absurd. Would you trade your village, gardens, your hunting rights on Manhattan, fishing rights around the island – for this paltry string of beads? And do what? Move to New Jersey? People already live across the Hudson, so you’d have to talk with them, perhaps fight with them, before simply moving in …Then consider the clothing. I have been in Manhattan in February, and if this purchase that never took place took place in February, that is one cold Native American person. I have also been in Manhattan in August, and if this purchase took place in August, then that Dutchman is about to suffer heat exhaustion. To put it another way, no two people were ever dressed so differently on the same spot on Earth on the same date. We miss noticing this because we are used to portraying Natives as “primitive” – nearly naked – and Europeans as “civilized” – elegantly clothed.Finally, consider the most famous street in America, Wall Street, named for the wall that the Dutch built at the northern edge of New Amsterdam to deter attacks from the indigenous owners of the island. Its name also exposes the ridiculousness of the $24 story.Overlooking the Atlantic in Newport, Rhode Island, stands two-thirds of a large granite globe, symbolizing the “two thirds of the earth” that Portuguese explorers “discovered”. Of course, from Goa to Angola to Brazil, people already lived there, but they didn’t really count they were not Europeans.In the last five years, especially since the white supremacist events in Charleston and Charlottesville, the celebrations of racism that used to dot our landscape from Boston to Seattle and San Diego to Key West have come under attack. The largest of these was the Jefferson Davis Highway, which stretched from Arlington, Virginia, to Richmond and Biloxi and on to San Diego before turning north and terminating at the Canadian border north of Bellingham, Washington. Just this year Arlington renamed its portion of the route, and markers signifying it have also been removed in California and Washington. The only reason this 4,300-mile highway was ever named for Davis was to tell Americans that he was great and we should honor him. And we did not do so because he had been a good senator in the 1840s or secretary of war in the 1850s – no, we honored him because he led a movement that committed treason on behalf of slavery and white supremacy.Lee’s surrender at Appomattox ended the larger part of the civil war. In 1926, the United Daughters of the Confederacy marked the end of the army with a plaque at Appomattox saying “Here … Lee surrendered 9000 men, the remnant of an army still unconquered in spirit, to 118,000 men under Grant.” (The last line has been removed but can still be read.) This plaque gets the numbers all wrong – not by accident, but as part of the “Lost Cause” narrative concocted to persuade white Americans that the southern cause was honorable and defeated only by the north’s vastly superior manpower.Historic houses usually tell heroic stories about their builders, leaving out any “bad parts”. Since we deemed homosexuality “bad” until the very recent past, our public history rarely acknowledged the sexual orientations of gays and lesbians. Surely the most outrageous of these sites is Wheatland, President James Buchanan’s house in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Visitors don’t learn that he was probably homosexual – or much else about him.There isn’t much doubt about Buchanan’s orientation. For years while serving in the US Senate he lived with William Rufus King, senator from Alabama. The two were inseparable writers referred to them as “the Siamese twins” and called King Buchanan’s “better half” and “his wife”. When in 1844 King was appointed minister to France, Buchanan wrote: “I am now ‘solitary and alone,’ having no companion in the house with me. I have gone a wooing to several gentlemen, but have not succeeded with any one of them.”Wheatland denies all this, as well as denying that Buchanan, like King, was pro-slavery.Every year, the marker program in Texas puts up more than 250 markers, more than most states have ever put up. Some simply don’t merit a sign. Surely that’s true of the plaque for the Magale Building in downtown Galveston, which tells that it used to house “a well-known paint and hardware store”.Texas also announces that the Wright brothers were not the first to fly that honor goes to the “Baptist minister and inventor Burrell Cannon”, who in 1902 flew an airship inspired by “a craft described in the Biblical book of Ezekiel”. The only problem was, it was powered by four vertically mounted paddlewheels. A paddlewheel works fine on a river, because there’s a difference between water and air, but on an airplane, whatever lift the wheel generates from its downward motion is dissipated by its later upward motion. As the Rev Cannon admitted later: “God never willed that this airship should fly.”Deaf and blind since early childhood, no American struggled more mightily to be heard than Helen Keller. As every schoolchild knows, she learned to write and even to speak. But our public history has silenced her. In 2009, Alabama replaced an out-of-fashion Confederate with Keller in the US Capitol, but not the adult Keller, who became a supporter of the NAACP and a founder of the ACLU. Instead, Alabama installed a statue of her at age seven. All other representations in America’s “Hall of Fame” are of adults. Keller’s birthplace in Tuscumbia similarly freezes her in childhood.I don’t think that Alabama’s leaders fear that if Americans learned that Keller was a leftwing activist, we’d all follow suit. I suspect it’s mere manners: we aren’t supposed to say anything bad about the dead, and socialism is bad, right? For whatever reason, however, Keller has been hushed.If Alabama has quieted a woman who spoke, Wyoming has given voice to one who never said anything. Wyoming was first in the nation to let women vote, as early as 1869. Later, two Wyoming residents decided it would be nice to credit a woman for so doing and chose Esther Morris, who had served briefly as a justice of the peace in 1870. Unfortunately, historians today agree that Morris had nothing to do with the law. Nevertheless, her statues stand at the state capitol and in Washington DC, where she is credited merely with being “present at a dinner in Cheyenne given for Susan B Anthony” in 1895!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4d20c38cc36a2c03104a0bcb83897ca80c29ce5/0_161_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fa18cbbc5a6d85b35c19849cc12d11d","title":"youth theatre booker prize acting creativity bernardine evaristo","story":"Acting onstage was how I discovered my creativity, away from class and racial isionAt the age of 12 I discovered Stage Centre, a former church in Plumstead, south-east London where a co-operative called Greenwich Young People’s Theatre put on drama workshops for children. I went with a friend who, horrified at being asked to prance around pretending to be an animal, spent the evening in the lavatory. I plunged in, loved it and the next week went back alone, continuing at least once a week until I was 16.Stage Centre was on a long residential hill that snaked down to Woolwich Arsenal. The church building, its altar serving as a stage and its original stained-glass windows, wooden beams and high ceilings intact, consisted of a large vestry, two spacious workshop areas, an upstairs costume room and several anterooms used for various purposes. It was a 10-minute walk from home and, this being suburbia in the 1970s, I made the journey alone, often returning home in the dark without a care in the world. There was only one incident in all those years – a flasher who dropped his pants when I passed by on the other side of the road.The youth theatre soon became the focus of my social life. I made friends quickly and looked forward to entering its creatively stimulating environment, where I took not only drama workshops but also dabbled in photography and design. It was affordable to attend, costing literally pennies. Middle-class kids from Blackheath and Greenwich mixed with the working-class kids from Plumstead and Woolwich, such as myself, without any snobbery or isions. Outside the arty bubble of the building, it wasn’t like that at all, and I was self-conscious at being a black child in a majority white society and all that entails.At the youth theatre, we learned to think independently and imaginatively while participating collaboratively in drama activities that developed our confidence and honed our performance skills. We put on plays, had major crushes on our workshop leader Rob Tiplady, and later on John Baraldi, who arrived as a blast of energy in 1974 with his exotic Canadian accent. He took us on a magical trip to Norway in the sweltering summer of 1976. For a girl from Woolwich whose only other trip abroad was a day boat trip to France at 13, it was incredibly exciting to be performing a play in castle ruins at sunset surrounded by Scandinavian fjords.I came to love acting so much I couldn’t imagine doing anything else. Rather like the writer I eventually became, I relished inhabiting characters who were not myself, expanding my own character, personality and emotions beyond the limits of my teenage identity. I found the process fascinating, absorbing and deeply rewarding. I also liked the attention, possibly because I was a middle child in a family of eight children. I learned that the arts world cherished difference, unlike my predominantly white girls’ school where everyone wore the same haircut, which I could never achieve anyway. At school, my passion for acting continued. I became the leading light of the drama group and once appeared in a professional production of a play with pop star Sandie Shaw who played a barefoot Saint Joan, but that’s another story.After the Friday workshops, from age 13 onwards a group of us who were tall and looked older would head off to the pub and enjoy half a pint of lager and lime or a small bottle of Babycham, while sharing a single cigarette. Those were the days.After school, I studied community theatre arts at college. I learned to stand for something larger than myself, to be the change I wanted to see in the world. I co-founded Theatre of Black Women with Patricia St Hilaire and Paulette Randall when we graduated in 1982, Britain’s first such company. There was little work for us out there. It was the logical thing to do.This year I am the inaugural Woolwich laureate, reconnecting to the home town I left when I was 18, and writing about it. I recently taught a series of writing workshops at my old youth theatre, now called Tramshed and based in the tram shed that opened as an arts venue when I was a teenager. It’s still going strong as an amazing, crucially, affordable resource offering all kinds of performance activities for young people.The converted church that was Stage Centre was long ago converted into flats. It was the incubator of my early creativity, a safe space to spend my childhood. I would never have won the Booker prize last week, alongside Margaret Atwood, if the youth theatre had not nurtured what would become a lifelong career in the arts. • Bernardine Evaristo won the 2019 Booker prize for her novel Girl, Woman, Other"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00acda3e2b9cfe958f5c32949fa306157f0e5dae/0_1438_2681_1607/master/2681.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b31d2f626b9e67eae287a93f0cc651ee","title":"wow factors 10 unmissable experiences in and around canadas greatest cities","story":"Get your fill of adrenalin-rush activities across Canada, with cave exploration, axe throwing and rodeos all in the mixCanada’s 10 provinces and three territories cover nearly 10m square kilometers and extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific, to the Arctic Ocean – meaning there’s a whole lot of country to explore. And its cities are as erse as its landscape, with enough to keep you coming back again and again.Add a pinch of serenity to your summer city break with a sunset stand-up paddle boarding tour through the calm waterways of the Toronto Islands. Set off with your guide just before sunset on a two-hour trip that not only includes spectacular views of the Toronto harbour skyline (photo opportunity level  high), but also an adventure through hidden passageway Turtle Alley, and an optional swim in the warm, shallow waters. Oh, and don’t worry about the dark: your illuminated torch paddle will help guide you on your way.Drive your own speedboat, VancouverAye, aye, captainOne of the best ways to see the stunning coastline of Vancouver and surrounding islands is by boat – especially when it’s a private boat. Granville Island Boat Rentals, located in the heart of downtown, allows locals and tourists alike to experience the magnificent waters of the Pacific Northwest in their own speedboat – and whether you want to zip around the harbour, cruise past Stanley Park and under the Lions Gate Bridge, head in search of the Granite waterfalls, or take a trip to the resident seal colony, the water is your oyster.Party in the Royal Ontario Museum, TorontoA night out at the museumSpice up your visit to the Royal Ontario Museum by attending one of the weekly Friday Night Live events – an after-hours extravaganza that sees visitors and locals alike drinking, dancing and discovering among the incredible collection of artefacts, including dinosaur bones, mummies and more. With different themes, live music acts and DJs each week, plus plenty of food and drink, it’s a night to remember.Explore the Canmore Caves, CalgaryNot one for the claustrophobicAn hour’s drive west of Calgary lies an underground adventure, in the form of the wild and relatively untouched Rat’s Nest Cave – one of the longest caves in Canada. Guided four- and six-hour tours begin with an 18-metre rappel into the depths of the cave, before you wiggle and slide along a route that includes passages and chambers such as the Laundry Chute, Five Way Chamber, Grand Gallery, and the Grotto – the latter featuring crystal-clear pools and walls covered in stalactites and stalagmites.

Along with tours of the bison prairie, the 260-hectare (640-acre) FortWhyte Alive nature park offers a host of other activities and attractions, including a freshwater aquarium, interpretive centre, 7km of forest trails, floating marsh boardwalks, several lakes, and more. An urban oasis!The Calgary Stampede, CalgaryLive that cowboy lifeCelebrating western heritage and tradition for more than a century, this is one of Canada’s most famous events for good reason, and the 10-day festival draws more than one million global visitors looking to experience rodeo culture at the annual stampede year after year. The daily rodeo – one of the largest outdoor rodeos in the world, no less – features the likes of bareback riding, barrel racing and steer wrestling. There’s also a city-wide celebration of events and activities, including chuckwagon races, live music, parades, First Nations exhibitions and a fireworks finale.Canoe in the city, EdmontonCity exploration, the river wayWho said city exploration has to be by foot? Give those feet a break from pounding pavement and take to the gorgeous North Saskatchewan River in a canoe instead. You’ll feel like you’ve escaped the urban jungle, while still discovering all that this vibrant city has to offer – from the iconic High Level Bridge streetcar and downtown skyscrapers to the glass pyramids of the Muttart Conservatory, home to a plethora of botanical delights.

But rather than opting for 10-pin bowling or the cinema, why not try some axe throwing on for size, at the Backyard Axe Throwing League? Exactly as it sounds, the activity involves hurling hatchets at a target similar to those used in archery, and it’s harder than the plaid-clad staff make it look. You get your own private space for throwing and work off some serious stress while having a good time.Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21, HalifaxDiscover Canada’s originsUncover some history at the Canadian equivalent of Ellis Island – Pier 21 – which was the gateway for more than 1 million immigrants entering the country between 1928 and 1971. The Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 now marks the historic spot, showcasing the compelling stories of those who left their homelands behind to start a new life in North America. Permanent and visiting exhibitions featuring first-hand testimonies and artefacts make for a fascinating visit, while there are also interactive elements such as a period costume dress-up box and Customs Challenge.Cross-country skiing, TorontoThere’s no business like snow businessMix up your city break with some outside entertainment, in the form of cross-country skiing, or snowshoeing. There’s no shortage of options in and around the city for some winter exploration, including the Toronto Islands, which have a network of beautiful and expansive trails that keep people coming back year after year.

Their institutions must listenOne of the biggest strikes will affect the NHS and St Mary’s hospital, along with the Ministry of Justice and the headquarters of ITV and Channel 4. Royal parks such as Hyde Park and St James’ Park will go unclean and unkempt as attendants walk out demanding the London living wage, proper sick pay and the lawful right to annual leave, which they are currently being denied.Among this disparate pool of employers, all of which are guilty of creating two-tiered, racially segregated workforces by outsourcing mainly black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) and migrant workers on the worst terms and conditions possible, British universities are overrepresented. Three major London universities will be affected: St George’s University, the University of Greenwich, and the University of East London (UEL).At Greenwich, cafe workers outsourced to BaxterStorey will strike to demand the London living wage, reduced workloads and occupational sick pay. These workers have never gone on strike before but now feel there is no alternative. All of them report being overworked and suffering either physically or mentally due to being employed on poor terms and conditions.One of these workers, a chef named Syddik, told me how one summer chronic understaffing meant he had to regularly work 80-hour weeks in intense heat. After one shift he collapsed and had to be hospitalised. But he was back in the kitchen the following day: he doesn’t have occupational sick pay, so if he misses a day’s work, he misses a day’s pay.Syddik’s story shows how outsourcing disproportionately affects BAME and migrant workers. Nowhere can this be seen more clearly than at the University of East London (UEL), where members work as security guards and are soon to be balloted for strike action. Previously they were outsourced to a contractor called Noonan, but in April of this year were brought in-house. Despite this the university still refuses to equalise their pay and conditions with its other employees. We will soon be arguing in court that this constitutes a breach of the Equality Act 2010.In 2017 UVW rang the death knell for outsourcing within our universities by becoming the first trade union to force a UK university, the London School of Economics, to bring all of its outsourced cleaners back in-house after what was then the largest cleaners’ strike in UK history.Since then many universities have followed suit, including London’s School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas), King’s College London, Goldsmiths and Birkbeck. It’s now indefensible that universities such as UEL and St George’s University continue to hold back progress. It is also incomprehensible, given that St George’s once produced a detailed business case for in-housing which concluded it would lead to a £200,ooo per annum saving.Once the financial savings argument has been discredited, how can outsourcing be justified? How can we not conclude that the reason outsourcing continues is because fundamentally universities believe their BAME and migrant workers, such as cleaners and security guards, are unworthy of the same terms and conditions as other, primarily British and white university staff?Brexit has created a fierce debate about the effect of migration on wages. But I hope that these strikes, and UVW’s past successes, will help people to make the case that Britain’s pandemic of low pay can never solved by the scapegoating of migrants. The only solution is having workers from all nations and races organise, unite and strike."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc0f8385e421753efcece36d2c66a6785a9bc921/0_127_4612_2767/master/4612.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71500187cb82888907dbe4bc03baa38e","title":"guardian editors climate emergency pledge","story":"Editors from across the  explain how they are putting the climate emergency front and centreThe climate crisis is a story that reaches every corner of the world and on the international news desk our team of correspondents report on it from around the globe.For many readers, it is something they experience to varying degrees of intensity at first hand – a hotter summer, an earlier spring, floods in autumn – but by linking up those experiences, we are able to show how interconnected this crisis is.In the past few months we have covered stories ranging from the record-breaking European heatwave, where temperatures of over 45C were recorded in France for the first time, a heatwave and drought in India, where thousands abandoned their homes, and the unprecedented Arctic wildfires that could be seen from space.Such events are not just “weather”, however, and we follow their impact: the buckling European road and rail infrastructure not suitable for the new climate era, the desperate search for water in Chennai and the Greenland residents traumatised by the climate emergency as life becomes more precarious and social problems such as alcoholism intensify.In Italy, the Planpincieux glacier in the Mont Blanc massif is changing so rapidly that avalanches and debris falls have led to deaths and evacuations, leaving residents in the town of Courmayeur fearing how much longer it will hold.Our reporters have also travelled to where governments and iniduals are making it worse. Latin American correspondent Tom Philips took a 2,000km journey through the Amazon to see the new age of wrecking ushered in by Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, where the environmental agency is being dismantled and gold seekers and soy farmers anticipate an economic boom from deforestation.There are also those attempting to make it better. On 1 September 2018 we published an interview from Stockholm with a 15-year-old who just two weeks earlier, after Sweden’s hottest ever summer, had gone on strike from school in protest at the lack of action by politicians on the climate crisis. Now much better known, thanks in part to articles like this, Greta Thunberg’s solo protest has since become a global movement.Climate can also lie at the root of other stories. Failed harvests and rising food prices can often be the final straw that triggers political upheaval, in recent years notably the Arab spring, but we are now seeing in real time how the climate emergency is affecting migration patterns. As Donald Trump attempted to close the US border to Central American migrants, in some cases separating children from their parents, we spoke to those in Guatemala who after a decade of intense droughts and late rains have seen crops fail and wages fall one too many times. “I have to find a way to travel north, or else my children will suffer even more,” subsistence farmer Esteban Gutiérrez told reporter Nina Lakhani.Business and economics are right at the centre of the climate emergency. Companies are among the biggest polluters in the world – and are key to meeting the Paris agreement’s target of limiting global warming to 1.5C.From giant fossil fuel companies to agricultural and food businesses, retailers, airlines and car manufacturers – all must make big changes, for the sake of the planet, the global economy and their own future sustainability, providing goods and services and employment.These are huge questions, and  readers know there are no easy answers. So we will nurture the debate on what a sustainable economy looks like.Our economics writers are questioning whether traditional capitalism, which aims for perpetual growth, can ever deal with the huge challenges of climate emergency, or whether a new slow-capitalism or green growth – which does not pursue profit at all costs – must come.We are reporting on the changes being made by corporate executives – and alerting readers to those who fall short.Writing in the  earlier this year, the governors of the Bank of England and Bank of France – Mark Carney and François Villeroy de Galhau – underlined the importance of change. “If some companies and industries fail to adjust to this new world, they will fail to exist,” they said.Without action, the climate emergency poses the risk of huge losses for insurance companies as a result of catastrophic weather-related events. Last year’s Californian wildfires, for instance – the worst in the state’s history – cost insurers more than $12bn. Banks that have lent vast sums to fossil fuel companies could be left with mammoth losses if those investments decline in value and become “stranded assets”. The Bank of England has warned that as much as $20tn of assets could be wiped out by climate change if the problem is not addressed.Many companies are making changes. Global businesses including Nestle and L’Oreal have committed to reducing their carbon emissions to zero. We will track and report on their progress.We are reporting on climate crisis initiatives, and our journalists will ask if they go far enough. Last week we reported that British Airways is to offset all emissions from domestic flights from next year, and questioned whether offsetting can ever be the answer.Our reporters will expose companies that are not walking the talk. Last month Amazon announced a series of initiatives, from putting 100,000 electric vans on the road to handle its deliveries to reforestation projects. But, as our reporters also revealed recently, Amazon has also recently introduced plastic packaging that cannot be recycled in the UK.Most corporate bosses know they have to make changes. But progress is nowhere near fast enough. Oil companies are still seeking new oilfields. Giant new coalmines – like Indian billionaire Gautam Adani’s Carmichael coalmine in Queensland – are still being developed. Airbus recently predicted that the number of aircraft in the sky would double in the next 20 years.Investment groups that manage pension funds around the world can exert pressure on companies to clean up their businesses. Legal \u0026amp General, Europe’s second biggest fund manager, admitted earlier this year: “The effects of climate change will soon be irreversible. This will affect economies, politics and, as a result, our clients’ assets all around the world. We all need to move faster.”However, not every investment group is using its muscle – and we are calling them out. BlackRock, the world’s biggest investment manager, with $6tn under its management, says climate change is a big risk to the value of its investments. But it remains at the heart of fossil fuel investing and, as we reported, its chief executive, Larry Fink, still insists that BlackRock’s job is to make a profit for investors. He added: “Our personal views on environmental or social issues don’t matter.”They do matter, and our reporters are now treating the climate crisis as the default setting for how they approach business reporting.Fashion is about the zeitgeist, and climate change is the mostimportant issue of our age. And we know that our readers really *do* care. (Sorry, Melania.) So more than ever before, we want to put sustainability front and centre of our fashion coverage.We aren’t perfect and we don’t pretend to have all the answers. Wewill continue to listen to a wide range of voices – our readersparamount amongst those – to guide us. But we do know that we want to talk about sustainability how we have always talked about fashion – in a way that includes everyone in the conversation, whatever their age, budget, gender or background.We have always championed ethical fashion brands, but now we want to go further. The future of our planet isn’t a niche interest. We aim to continue creating fashion content that is accessible and appealing, desirable and democratic – but now with sustainability as a fundamental metric. We want to inspire our audience to enjoy fashion while being mindful of the impact on the planet.What does that look like? We try wherever we can to include vintagepieces in shoots and gift guides. When we report from London fashion week we talk to the Extinction Rebellion activists outside the shows, as well as having backstage chats with the designers. We championed Secondhand September and a year ago we updated my column in Weekend magazine so that you now see me wearing old clothes from my own wardrobe, and vintage pieces, alongside new clothes. This party season we will be reporting the best places to rent your dress, or source it pre-worn, rather than buy it.None of this means compromising on bringing you compelling, gorgeous, original fashion content. We are passionate about the latest fashion – and about the future of our planet, too.There’s an obvious connection between food and the climate emergency. Look at the deforestation of the Amazon to provide grazing for cattle and soy to feed it. But wherever cows are raised, they generate atmosphere-heating methane. As the global human population grows, it’s clear that we need to think about how to feed it, how to use land and what impact our choices have.Meat eating and animal farming have seized the headlines and the public’s focus. There are many reasons why veganism – or at least flexitarianism – is growing fast and sustainability is one of them.It’s important to talk about all this but what people eat is always going to be a highly personal decision. In many countries where we have the luxury of food options, we are in anxious, uncertain, ided times. Food is joyful. It brings people together – families, friends, communities and strangers – and reminds us both of our uniqueness and of what we have in common. It’s also a time when it’s difficult to know who to believe and to trust. I hope people can be sure of the ."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afe269d9ec06740a551d25fa8d8e07c902892cd2/0_260_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08d6b0d86d0b03a66ff9f5ee4bdec8e2","title":"guardian climate pledge 2019 images pictures guidelines","story":" picture editor Fiona Shields explains why we are going to be using fewer polar bears and more people to illustrate our coverage of the climate emergency At the  we want to ensure that the images we publish accurately and appropriately convey the climate crisis that we face. Following discussions among editors about how we could change the language we use in our coverage of environmental issues, our attention then turned to images. We have been working across the organisation to better understand how we aim to visually communicate the impact the climate emergency is having across the world.Our goal is to provide guidelines for anyone working with images at the . We are also asking the agencies and photographers we work with to provide images that are appropriate to the changing narrative.The concern over how best to depict the climate emergency led us to seek advice from the research organisation Climate Visuals, who have found that “images that define climate change shape the way it is understood and acted upon”.It was important to address our own use of images and understand the processes that lead to image selection for our environmental and weather stories. When given a story, a picture editor or subeditor may have a short time to choose an image from our database, which is why the availability and prominence of climate crisis photography is a key element in the process. It can also be difficult for photographers to capture images that reflect global heating, weather patterns and wildlife extinction, especially when trying to depict what cannot always be seen.We know, from years of experience, that people love polar bears and pandas, so it is easy to see how these appealing creatures have become the emblems for the topics of endangered species and what we previously termed as global warming. Often, when signalling environmental stories to our readers, selecting an image of a polar bear on melting ice has been the obvious – though not necessarily appropriate – choice. These images tell a certain story about the climate crisis but can seem remote and abstract – a problem that is not a human one, nor one that is particularly urgent.So it made sense when we heard that research conducted by the team at Climate Visuals has shown that people respond to human pictures and stories. Images that show emotion and pictures of real situations make the story relevant to the inidual. Rather than choosing, say, an image of a smoke stack pumping out pollution or a forest on fire, such as this: … we should consider showing the direct impact of environmental issues on people’s daily lives as well as trying to indicate the scale of the impact, such as these:In the UK, the weather is a national preoccupation and as such a subject of tradition for British newspapers. People enjoying a sunny holiday weekend, or a fresh fall of snow at home or abroad can deliver some delightful and beautiful images:But as we have reported, the science tells us a much more sinister story of regular heatwaves and unseasonal weather being a defining indicator of the climate crisis. So, although scenes of children playing in fountains and everyone racing to the beach can be uplifting and irresistible, we have to be mindful of the tone of our journalism. This summer, the British media published dramatic headlines issuing climate warnings and covered in detail the negative impact of the crisis, but the images were typically of people taking pleasure in the environment. The contradiction in messaging, between the headlines and imagery, can undermine the effect of the reporting and how we perceive the risks.In June this year we published a picture gallery on the heatwave across Europe. In its original form, this was of a lighter tone, but we felt on reflection this was wrong and disregarded the current context, so we amended the publication to include images that covered a range of human experience of the extraordinary temperatures.The photographer Brook Mitchell made an impactful series about the drought in Australia affecting families in New South Wales, which we published as a photo essay in July. The environmental scenes of the scorched landscape were striking, as were the suffering animals, but the portraits and stories of the people battling the catastrophe really anchored the piece and drove the level of engagement.It is an example of how, as picture editors and photographers, we are having to think again about finding the right focus. Many of the impacts to communities, bioersity, agriculture, water and food supply represent the escalating crisis our planet faces, yet visually they can be far more challenging to depict. We need new imagery for new narratives. This can be challenging in a fast-paced newsroom but it is important to be nuanced and creative with search terms to unearth photography beyond the usual keywords of climate change, heatwave and floods.As our stories make a journey from their initial point of publication through the various networks of social media we also have to be mindful of how the image is connected to the headline. We have to consider that the two must work together to allow the reader to make a broad sense of the article often simply at a glance. Relatable images that are not overly abstract have become a good choice.However, in its simplest form, getting the emotional tone of imagery in line with the issue is critical, rather than the visual overload of society universally having fun in the sun. We hope that if we keep having these conversations, we will be able to have even more of an impact with our climate coverage, and others will follow suit.If you are a journalist, a photographer or work with other news organisations depicting the climate crisis, please contact membershipeditorial@ to join our conversation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6aa18d2a32dce609d4eb036565424fe22b3b0a8f/0_78_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75e821f5ce30ae6fcdc4646cb012cff8","title":"guardian climate pledge 2019 air travel advice","story":" travel editor Andy Pietrasik explains how a flexitarian approach can enable us to enjoy exploring the planet without increasing our carbon footprintWe recently published a guide to Helsinki in which we gave details of how to get there and back without flying. In the comments below the article, a reader wrote: “I think you have to concede that it’s a little disingenuous to pretend that people will be going to Helsinki by train and boat … very few will be willing to allocate six days of the holiday just for the journey. It’s simply not a practical suggestion.”The rise of low-cost flights over the past 20 or so years means we have become so accustomed to flying everywhere for our holidays and short breaks that the idea of taking so long over a journey has become unthinkable. We expect to maximise our time in a location and minimise our time in transit. But maybe that has to change.Another reader put this into context: “In the 70s it was customary to travel around Europe by train (or bus, or hitchhiking). I’ve travelled between Finland and the UK many times by train, and it is quite a pleasant experience.”Travel can have a magical transformation on iniduals and communities. We hope through our pages to encourage people to explore the world, to discover, first-hand, locations they may only have read about in history books or novels to open themselves up to new experiences and tastes to meet people with different ideas and perspectives to try out alternative lifestyles to immerse themselves in beautiful landscapes to have fun. Our writers tap into the joy of new experiences, whether it’s the exhilaration of swimming through a city, as our writer did in Basel, or the thrill of tackling Ireland’s Big Five adventures. And we know that our readers are adventurous and well-travelled because every week we feature their tips from around the world. But we also recognise the need to help tackle the climate emergency by reducing the number of flights we all take. Environment journalist John Vidal explored the dilemma that “people like me, cursed with loving travel” now face, when he reported on the Swedish concept of “flygskam”, or fly shame. And he referred to people applying the idea of the “flexitarian” diet – where they cut back on their meat consumption dramatically but not completely – to flying.The majority of locations we feature in the ’s weekly travel section do not rely on flying to get there, with most easily accessible by train and public transport. These range from Greek island-hopping odysseys to cycling holidays through Europe and city breaks served by train or ferries.Our Local’s Guide series is one of the most popular and widely read features because each one is written by a local resident in the spirit of showing a visitor around their favourite affordable haunts, rather than the big-ticket attractions. Food and drink is probably the easiest way into another culture, and there can be no better recommendation for somewhere to eat and drink than from someone who lives there. We’ve been tapping in to local people’s tips since Twitter started more than 10 years ago, and have found bloggers all around Europe to compile lists of their favourite cheap places to eat and drink.On our website, we have a long list of guides to alternative cities – Łódź, Genoa and Utrecht, Berne, Burgos and Bristol, for example – rather than perennial hotspots affected by overtourism, such as Barcelona, Amsterdam and Venice.One of the benefits of flying less, of course, is the opportunity it affords to explore the rich and varied landscapes of our own islands. Over the summer, we ran a popular series of stories called car-free coast, in which the writer Phoebe Taplin explored the British seaside on foot and by bus. An avowed public transport enthusiast and non-flyer, Dixe Wills, shared 20 of his favourite campsites accessible by train and bus. And Kevin Rushby set out on a UK expedition to less-visited locations that would have been impossible or prohibitively expensive to get to by car.We still occasionally run stories on long-haul destinations when there is an important initiative or project that benefits the environment or local community, such as the development of community-led tourism startups in Chilean Patagonia following the launch of new national parks in the world’s most ambitious rewilding project.Tourism accounts for one in 10 of the world’s jobs and is vital to some destinations. Kevin Rushby, our principal travel writer, explains: “All around the world, people in disadvantaged communities have been working to set up projects that rely on tourism, and so flying. I’ve met hunters who’ve become wildlife guides, fishermen who are now ing instructors, farmers who get cash for showing visitors their land and life. In Kenya the great migration route has been saved by Maasai herders clubbing their land together as conservancies rather than selling to hoteliers and intensive farming interests. Those conservancies are reliant on overseas visitors who pay to see wildlife.”The Travel website now also features a carbon calculator, and we have written about various carbon offsetting schemes – which allow people to balance out their carbon footprints by investing in clean energy projects such as solar or windfarms. Our travel section is printed and distributed in the UK but our articles online are read by a worldwide audience, so in some instances readers do not need to fly to the places we are writing about.John Vidal’s article about reducing the number of flights we take quotes Kevin Anderson, professor of energy and climate change at the Tyndall centre in Manchester: “I don’t have a no-fly policy, but rather a fly-less one … If we are going to fly, it should be for truly extraordinary and important reasons. Otherwise we shouldn’t go, or we should take a slower form of travel and arrange for a longer visit.”Returning to that article on Helsinki, there’s another Scandinavian lifestyle trend that has emerged as a positive counterbalance to “flygskam”, and that is “tagskryt” (train brag). Another reader of the article captured its spirit perfectly in the comment: “The journey is the holiday. Just think of all the places you see along the way.”Because, of course, we’ve been doing long-distance slow travel since the 1970s, as was pointed out. That was the decade when the Interrail scheme was launched. And, as Wills said when he revisited the Interrail experience this summer after a 30-year gap: “How many of us have cherished memories of zipping inexpensively across Europe – delving into new and thrillingly esoteric cultures, befriending the locals, mangling their language beyond all comprehension, and enjoying all manner of mind-broadening episodes.”That is the spirit of adventure we hope you take away with you after reading the travel section."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3858d96ea129929c09d1781ed401f522605d3b80/218_2651_3014_1809/master/3014.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32a34a700de9e45906839302b85b17e9","title":"have you spotted any new buds or flowers in october","story":"If you have seen any plants flowering unusually this month, we would like to see your photosAccording to former  environment correspondent Paul Brown, “new research published in Geophysical Research letters show that so-called “cold” days in European winters are on average 3C warmer than 70 years ago”.Some people have reported seeing new flower buds in the unseasonal temperatures, leading to worries the flowers will be killed by the winter weather and may not bloom again in spring.If you have seen any plants with new buds or flowers appearing we would like to hear from you.When did you first see them and do you have any concerns about what it might mean for them come spring?

From 2013, they decided to take a closer look at the greater sea snake to better understand its importance to the bay’s ecosystem.“The study zone is in the most touristic bay in Noumea, so I often meet people when I am doing field work on sea snakes,” Goiran said. “When I was snorkelling on my own studying sea snakes, I used to meet a friend of mine called Aline that was snorkelling and taking photos on the same reef. In order to help me, she started taking photos of sea snakes and would send them to me by mail.“I was very happy, so she asked her neighbour and friend Monique to help me too. Monique asked another friend, and soon there were seven grandmothers helping me.” The group named themselves “the fantastic grandmothers” and range in age from 60 to 75.As the grandmothers sent photos through to Goiran and Shine, they realised they had vastly underestimated the population of greater sea snakes. Goiran and Shine have now published a paper in the journal Ecosphere revealing there are more than 250 greater sea snakes in the bay. Greater sea snakes have distinctive markings, allowing iniduals to be easily identified from photographs.“Even when I am stuck at university with teaching, I know what is going on in the study zone because the grandmas survey the zone for me and send me the photos,” Goiran said.“Remarkably,” Shine added, “the grandmothers found a large number of lethally toxic sea snakes in a small bay that is occupied every day by hordes of local residents and cruise‐ship passengers – yet no bites by the species have ever been recorded at Baie des Citrons, testifying to their benevolent disposition.”They said the findings mean the role the snakes play in the functioning of the ecosystem is more important than previously thought. Scientists believe the snakes likely play a role in nutrient cycling through coral reefs, but there is little research available.Would this work have been possible without help from the citizen scientist grandmas?“Of course not,” Goiran said. However it was hard to get all seven in the group going out at the same time, she said, because “there is always at least one away hiking, biking, sailing, taking yoga class or taking care of the grandkids”.One of the grandmothers, Aline Guémas, said she was not scared of the greater sea snakes despite their potential deadly bite. The grandmothers always keep their distance and never touch them. “That’s the job of the boss,” Guémas said.Her job was just to take videos and photos. Other members of the group helped with identifying the snakes and documenting their characteristics. The sea snakes could move quickly, making taking photographs difficult at times. But Guémas said “they are very slow in their movements when they forage for food”, making those times ideal for photography.Her friend in the group, Sylvie Shebert, said she was afraid of the snakes at first but has grown to appreciate them. “It has been interesting to learn about and discover their lifestyle and to work with the group,” she said. “It allows us to integrate our swimming with the scientific world by sharing the results of what we find with the researchers, such as the area where the snake is located, it’s condition such as if it is pregnant or not, that kind of thing.”Monique Mazière said “the snakes are not aggressive, just curious”.“Of course, we will never touch them.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2d067107d8284b646616fee8ed3d84c9f51fc82/717_135_4083_2450/master/4083.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c25bafa74c7a4b720a24f349a252501","title":"wildlife corridors to save borneo elephants in pictures","story":"Deforestation in Malaysia and Indonesia has endangered the Borneo elephant, which depends on forest connectivity to survive, by isolating it from large foraging grounds.

And that’s not to mention the rise of ‘hard coffee’It’s annoying when a meme arrives in your life before the product it is meming about is available in the country you live in. It is as though there is an inferior broadband connection on your material reality. I know, just from an ambient awareness of the US comedian Trevor Wallace – who gave birth to the meme “drinks White Claw once” – that the drink White Claw is very popular in the US. I also know – from the same source – that “there ain’t no laws when you’re drinking claws”. Yet I could only source a White Claw from the US. If you went into a pub asking for a “spiked seltzer”, they would most probably just get a soda water and put some vodka in it, at least if they had any initiative.Across a spectrum of zingy flavours – lime, grapefruit, cherry – White Claw is, as you may have guessed, a fizzy drink with booze in it. You can’t really taste the booze because your brain just shovels it into the category of fruity carbonation. I like it because it reminds me of my dad, who would put alcohol in just about anything: whisky in tea vodka in chocolate milk one time, with limited options in a car (not driving, I hope, although that would be a very my dad thing to do), he mixed grappa with Benylin to create a cocktail known as the “coughtail”. White Claw, incidentally, shot to prominence so quickly that it found itself inserted into the culture wars: what was later discovered to be a hoax account on Twitter published an image that appeared to show the White Claw account supporting Blue Lives Matter, a pro-police countermovement to Black Lives Matter. White Claw had nothing to do with it, and so the attempt to cancel the brand was diffused.You will be wondering how this differs from the alcopops of the 90s, violently coloured neon drinks that attracted peculiar amounts of moral opprobrium, back in the day when we didn’t have more important things to get puffed up about. The Co-op banned sales of alcopops in June 1997: five weeks after the Labour landslide, when things could only get better, when Britannia was finally cool, people were so worried about children getting hooked on alcohol because it was turquoise that there were supermarket wars over who was the most socially responsible, mediated through Hooch and Two Dogs lemonade. The arrival of alcohol-spiked milks Moo and Super Milch that year was also taken as a tilt towards the youth market, although presumably they weren’t intended for the classic milk consumer, the baby. One slightly half-hearted corporate defence at the time was that alcopops were intended for women, who wanted to drink without smelling of alcohol. I feel sure I heard someone on the radio use the word “housewife”.In the US during the same period, Zima was the alcopop, and even though it was marketed obsessively to men, only women drank it, hence “bitch beer”. There’s a lot of raw misogyny in the spiked-soft-drink culture.Anyway, with autumn upon us, enter canned “hard coffee”: a generic alcohol base mixed with cold brew or coffee extract, milk and sugar. Is it dangerous, concerned citizens ask, remembering their Red Bull-and-vodka disasters of last century? Not really, reply other citizens, who have been drinking irish coffee and espresso martinis since before Starbucks existed (yes, really). In case of category confusion, bear in mind: this is not a morning drink. There is no such thing as a morning drink."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d114e92b86afd9a86a50e97f69b26724eb58a7da/0_1318_3883_2330/master/3883.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c617350b2c21ce79bb3722ca17c643d","title":"not just for carving chefs on the twelve most delicious ways to cook pumpkin","story":"From chowders to sourdough, restaurateurs and cooks explain how to get the best from the orange gourdsThe statistics on Halloween food waste are suitably frightening. More than 8m pumpkins are expected to be binned uneaten this year, acccording to research by stock cube makers Knorr and the food-waste charity Hubbub. That’s more than 18,000 tonnes of edible flesh. Most of us do not even consider pumpkins food.That misunderstanding has been compounded by carving pumpkins occasionally being labelled “for ornamental use only”. But that is changing: Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Waitrose, for example, do not use such labelling all of their carving pumpkins are edible.It can be hard work to hollow out these thin-walled but robust monsters, discard the toughest fibrous bits, separate the seeds and create something tasty from the watery flesh. But you can make delicious food from even the most unpromising pumpkin. Here are some ideas from chefs, bakers and cookery writers.The wet flesh in bigger pumpkins lends itself to pie fillings. Roast chunks with lots of garlic until caramelised and toss it in a blitzed dressing of sage, lemon zest and oil. Line a bread tin with shortcrust pastry (at home, I use all-butter Jus-Rol) and pack the mix in. After cooking – 45 minutes at 210C (190C fan)410Fgas mark 7 – the filling will still be juicy and the pastry perfect – and you get that mosaic effect of the dressing and its flavours running around the chunks and right through the pie. Calum Franklin, executive chef, Holborn Dining Rooms, LondonHalloween pumpkins can be watery, so once you’ve cooked the flesh, hang it in a colander overnight to get rid of as much liquid as possible. You want intense flavour. These tortelli come from Lombardy and they are basically pumpkin mixed with mostarda (mustard oil and fruit preserve) and parmesan, stuffed into pasta and served with sage butter. It isn’t measured exactly it’s down to taste. Puree the mixture if you like, too. I would recommend people make fresh pasta for this. Roll it out thinly in one long strip, dot your pumpkin mix on, fold it over, seal it, cut it – I use a square shape – and you have lovely tortelli. Angela Hartnett, chef-owner, Murano, LondonWhen you add roasted, liquidised pumpkin to sourdough (200g to 1kg of flour reduce the water slightly), you get a gorgeous loaf. It imparts a natural earthy flavour, as well as making the crumb noticeably softer. And you get a crisper crust. After removing any fibrous material around the seeds, gently dry them in a low oven and roast them with salt and olive oil – you can put them in the bread, too. The key thing to know when adding seeds is that they suck moisture from bread. Immediately after roasting them, pour a little water over the seeds and they will absorb it. You will get all the toasted flavour, but no dry seeds. Aidan Monks, owner-baker, Lovingly Artisan, CumbriaTechnically, because it contains seeds, pumpkin is a fruit – so why not treat it as one? Finely chop the flesh, add a little water and a handful of brown sugar and let it bubble until pulpy. Blitz with a hand blender, put it back on the stove and cook it until it is thick and spitting. Let it cool and thicken and there you go: pumpkin jam. It’s sweet, so stick it on dark rye sourdough. It needs that bitterness. Andrew Dargue, chef-owner, Vanilla Black, LondonLocro de zapallo is a classic Peruvian, originally Andean, dish, usually served with white rice. The quick, easy version is: sauté sliced onions, garlic and red chilli in olive oil, add pumpkin (250g per person, roughly cubed) and vegetable stock, and cook until the pumpkin breaks down but still retains some chunks. To finish, add cooked broad beans, tons of chopped parsley and a dash of cumin. It should be a vibrantly orange, garlicky, thick, sloppy stew, fresh with parsley. This is vegan but, if you want, add cream and crumbled feta. Martin Morales, chef-owner, Ceviche restaurants, LondonIdeally, choose a smaller, sweeter pumpkin for this tasty, simple Valencian dessert. Cover the pumpkin with foil and bake for about an hour at 190C (170C fan)gas mark 5. In a sieve, press out as much water as possible and then mash it until smooth. To make four portions, mix 400g of pumpkin with 50g ground almonds, 60g sugar, one egg yolk, half a teaspoon of cinnamon and lemon zest. Spoon it into inidual ramekins, top with blanched almonds and honey and bake until golden. We serve it with homemade turrón ice cream. Joe Wright, chef-owner, Porta, ChesterA light, vegan hug-in-a-bowl for autumn. Sauté onion, minced garlic and charred sweetcorn with four tablespoons of olive oil. Add a tablespoon of plain or gluten-free flour, followed by cubes of pumpkin – you can use any, from fibrous Halloween types to our favourite acorn squash. Then, adding veg stock slowly, cook until it is just soft. Finish with seasoning, chopped flat-leaf parsley and roasted pumpkin seeds. Samantha Evans, chef-owner, Hang Fire Southern Kitchen, Barry, WalesDry-fried pumpkin seeds – keep them moving in the pan so they don’t burn – are great in adventurous salads. They work especially well as a nutty complement to sweet-sour pops of fresh fruit. One of my favourites is our take on chana chaat. This sees toasted pumpkin seeds, couscous, chickpeas, raisins, a little fresh tomato and pomegranate seeds tossed together, seasoned and drizzled with coriander-mint dressing, made by blitzing fresh coriander, toasted coriander seeds, mint, sugar, pickled chillies, sunflower seeds, turmeric and lime juice. Naved Nasir, executive chef, DishoomThis pre-Hiic Mexican recipe uses pumpkin seeds, with the red coming from charred tomatoes and dried guajillo chilli. Roast 800g of tomatoes, 500g of onions and peeled garlic, turning occasionally. Toast 25g of chillies for about 30 seconds, then soften them in boiling water. In a blender, process all the ingredients and 380g of toasted pumpkin seeds until smooth. Pass the salsa through a strainer, season and serve with the roasted chicken or pumpkin. It’s a kiss of spiciness – but not overpowering. Martha Ortiz, chef-patron, Ella Canta, LondonThis is my take on a pumpkin spiced latte. To make six, put half a tablespoon of coffee granules in 300ml of milk – granules work best to get that proper coffee taste – and heat until infused. Then add 360ml of cooked pumpkin puree, 420ml of double cream, 120ml of caster sugar and a teaspoon of cinnamon, mix it together and bring it almost to the boil. Off the heat, add three sheets of pre-soaked bronze leaf gelatine. Whisk thoroughly and sieve it. Pour into moulds and allow six hours to set.

The decision was made despite China’s suppression of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, and the internment of more than one million Uighur Muslims in the state of Xinjiang.“This is a historic decision for football because the Fifa council decided unanimously to appoint China as the host for the new Fifa World Cup for clubs,” said Fifa’s president, Gianni Infantino, in announcing the decision.“The new Fifa World Cup for clubs will be a competition which every person who loves football looks forward to. It is the first real and true world cup for the best teams and clubs in the world.”Fifa was immediately criticised for the move, with Amnesty International UK’s head of policy and government affairs, Allan Hogarth, saying: “China being chosen to host the Fifa Club World Cup in 2021 presents Beijing with yet another opportunity to try to ‘sportswash’ its tarnished international reputation.“It’s likely the Chinese authorities will see the competition as an opportunity to project an image of openness and toleration, whereas the much darker reality in the country is one of pervasive censorship, relentless round-ups of dissidents, and the shocking mass detention of Uighurs in Xinjiang.“China has an atrocious human rights record and Fifa must use its considerable influence to push for human rights improvements in the country.“Any club involved in a China-hosted Club World Cup – from players through to coaches and backroom staff – should be ready to speak out on human rights issues in China.”The revamped cup came in for heavy criticism even before Thursday’s announcement. The European Club Association, a body representing the continent’s biggest clubs, has threatened to boycott the expanded even event. In a letter written to Uefa in March, 15 of the ECA’s clubs wrote that they were “firmly against any approval of a revised Club World Cup at this point in time and confirm that no ECA clubs would take part to such a competition”.The tournament currently involves seven teams – with the Champions League winners Liverpool set to take part in this year’s tournament in Qatar.

After a lacklustre first season, he joined England for their disastrous 2016 Euro campaign which saw them knocked out by Iceland in the last 16.A disappointing first year followed by a disastrous summer. Enter Pep. City’s football director, Txiki Begiristain, had signed Sterling specifically in anticipation of Pep taking over.“He had a spark, a capacity to shake off markers. He’s explosive and above all he’s got that burst of pace which takes effective wide players to the goalline. Even then, it was also clear that he was a guy who loved to cut in, too.”Begiristain’s football instincts were correct. Under the guidance of Pep and his team, Sterling has become a truly world-class player. In his first season under Manuel Pellegrini, Sterling managed only six league goals and by the second half of the campaign had lost his place as a regular starter.“The huge transfer fee was actually pretty detrimental in terms of his self-confidence, which is so important for any player. As things didn’t come off for him you could almost see Raz fading away,” explains Mikel Arteta, who was still playing for Arsenal at the time. The following year, Arteta joined Pep and Domènec Torrent at City and he began to work closely with Sterling.“We wanted him much closer to the penalty area. It was like he was a bit scared of the goal. We wanted him to become the kind of player who would get us a goal every game, or even just missing two or three big chances. We wanted him constantly generating goal threat. And we wanted him to lose the fear. He needed to believe in himself, to believe that he could be the best.”The new regime had an almost immediate impact. Suddenly his head was up, he was running more than ever and, by Pep’s second season, had formed one of the most lethal attacking forces in the history of the Premier League with Leroy Sané and Sergio Agüero, between them scoring 67 of the team’s total of 140 goals.First, however, the coaching team had to realign Sterling for his role on the right of Guardiola’s trident. Mikel Arteta: “He’d picked up a few bad habits along the way. He’d played on the inside a lot or out on the left wing. When you move to the right wing, the direction and angle of possession coming to you is very different. When the ball reached him he really had his gaze fixed on it – rather than half-touch instinctive control and the vision of what’s around him.”Sterling was static when he got the ball. Guardiola’s solution was to try to turn him into City’s version of Romário, the coach’s old Barcelona teammate and a World Cup winner with Brazil in 1994.Pep Guardiola: “In that Dream Team era, whenever I saw Romário with his back to the centre-halves I’d never give him the ball. But the instant I saw him on the half-turn with his shoulder dipping as if he wanted the ball fed into his right or left foot, I knew he thought he could explode away from his marker. In that instance I always hit the pass immediately. Every time. I’d learned that his vision meant he’d had one eye on the distance between him and the opposition goal and the other eye on where the ball was. If he opened up his body shape like that and I fed him the ball, the defender was automatically done for.”The key to this strategy was Sterling’s acceleration. Guardiola’s analysis staff compare their forward’s explosive first steps to those of Leo Messi. While the Barcelona player doesn’t possess a sprinter’s speed over distance, his acceleration – combined with an intuitive sense of when to make his move – leaves defenders in his wake. Thus began the Romário-fication of Raheem.The plan was that Sterling should make a habit of dropping slightly further away from his marker, or nearest opponent, when looking to receive possession, his body turned towards the goal. In that position, if he then gunned his extraordinary accelerator, the sprint was always to the danger area. Arteta: “If he’s found a space about three metres off his defender but he’s half-turned towards the goal then his sprint takes him much more quickly to a space where he can shoot and that’s going to cause the rival much more damage. It’s also a tactic, dropping off a little, so that your defender gets drawn into a position he mightn’t want to be in. It leaves space behind him and Raheem can attack that space. If it’s close to, or in the penalty area, they also have to hesitate before putting in a challenge.”Arteta is drawing on facts with his assessment. For example, in the 1-0 Champions League victory over Feyenoord in November 2017, Sterling pulled all of this together. He dropped off at the edge of the box, drawing his defender, Renato Tapia, with him and, with his back to goal, shunted a quick pass backwards to Gundogan. The instant he released the ball, he swivelled and burst into one of his 0-60 sprints, into the space where Tapia had been. Gundogan read the move, slid the one-two pass into that space. One-v-one with the keeper, Sterling lofted it over Brad Jones for City’s winning goal.Sterling played increasingly on the left wing in season 2018-19, although Guardiola continued to move him around a lot. His partnership with Bernardo Silva went from strength to strength, meaning that Sané figured much less in the starting XI. The PFA Young Player of the Year won by Sané in 2018 went to Sterling in 2019, after he finished the season with a personal best of 25 goals and 18 assists from 51 games. By November 2018 City had seen enough to extend Sterling’s contract through season 2022-23.Yet Guardiola continues to see room for improvement. Take the coach’s critique of him after the home game against Watford on 9 March 2019, in which he had scored a hat-trick by the 64th minute. “Sterling could do better. He didn’t follow his full-back two times. He lost two, three or four balls which he has to avoid because he conceded counterattacks. Of course, I am so glad in terms of what he has done, scoring three goals. The first half was not the best Raheem has done this season and we will work on that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccaa3741c9d6369996863c2bf7c3b59803671721/23_80_3720_2232/master/3720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=83a378bcb8c69056fa5c2b86d0166059","title":"watford lead way crypto express new technology","story":"Can digital currency bring supporters from all over the world together and give them a role in the club, or is it just a gimmick?Last month, Watford took an unusual decision. Not the one to sack Javi Gracia four matches into the season that was kind of standard. Rather it had something to do with the sleeves on the kit that, the club said, would be sporting the logo of Bitcoin. Hoping to “educate the public on the benefits of using cryptocurrencies”, the sponsorship would form part of a “wider campaign to improve awareness”.Another measure allowed supporters to pay with Bitcoin at the club’s online store. In doing so, Watford became one of the first football clubs in the world to accept digital currency. Suspicion remains they will not be turning over vast amounts of the stuff, however, when even Bitcoin’s cheerleaders – including the gambling company sportsbet.io, which is Watford’s main shirt sponsor and paid for the sleeve endorsement – accept a campaign is necessary to explain what Bitcoin is.Cryptocurrency (crypto for short) cannot be readily reduced into a simple concept, but here’s an attempt: it describes a digital form of money created independently of any central bank that is encrypted and so is anonymous and verifiable. If that still seems impenetrable then be assured you are not alone. But for now it’s enough to recognise that a lot of people see crypto – and the blockchain, the technology that underpins it – as the future, even if they’re not quite sure how. These people are generally interested in making money off the back of it. That football should want to be involved is predictable and also revealing.Watford are not alone in joining the crypto express. Bayern Munich have launched a series of blockchain “collectibles” that is a kind of crypto Top Trumps. Manchester City have done the same, except theirs is a crypto Tamagotchi (the game is called FC Superstars and is made in conjunction with a South Korean company called Superbloke).Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain, Atlético Madrid, Roma, Galatasaray and West Ham have signed deals with Socios. The plan here is for fans to acquire club tokens, some for free, others bought using Socios’s own cryptocurrency, Chiliz (one of 3,000 cryptocurrencies being traded online). These tokens would confirm you as a supporter though what you do with them next is not clear.Dreyfus envisages a future where token holders have a say in the running of their club (perhaps helping to choose the next kit design, say). He says that this is a commitment shared by Socios’s partners . One of those partners, however, said they would not be countenancing such measures for fear of creating two tiers of support: those that had the tokens and those that didn’t.As for the selling of stuff, that seems mainly to involve fan tokens themselves. Dreyfus’s Twitter feed features a mock-up of a talk show with people chatting about clubs and their tokens as an index of their value flashes alongside. It’s a cross between Soccer Saturday and a business channel and as baffling as that sounds.Socios does not exist yet, either. The first sponsorship deals, with Juve and PSG, were announced a year ago but the company’s website still offers the chance only to “stay in the loop” about the product’s launch. Plans for a Pokemon Go-style token hunt this summer never materialised. Dreyfus said he expected a soft launch this month and on Twitter has suggested lift-off in “the next few weeks”.Crypto went mainstream a couple of years ago thanks to an explosion in the value of Bitcoin. Despite falling back since (a single Bitcoin is still worth more than £6,500) the enthusiasm remains and while practical uses appear limited there are ways crypto and sport, particularly football, intertwine seductively.First, shopping in crypto allows fans in Hong Kong to behave like fans in Harlow, Essex. Second, it allows them to gamble like them too (as Watford’s sponsors are no doubt well aware). Third, it is at least an attempt to create something like a stake in a club for fans who only ever follow the team on the screen. These fans, it should not need pointing out, outnumber the physical variety by orders of magnitude.Gandham believes the current offering remains unclear. “The companies that release these tokens have to have a long hard think and ask: ‘Are we really giving something back to the fans?’” he says. “Do they get ownership in the club? Do they get voting rights, and if so what do they entail? If it’s a real change it could become a useful thing for an inidual to have. If it just gives you a discount on a shirt, I’m not sure fans will react in the way that the clubs and companies want them to.”Scepticism about crypto is healthy and there have been a number of scams associated with digital currency, with the Financial Conduct Authority estimating Britons have lost £27m this year. Questions of utility remain, too, but people such as Dreyfus are plugged into a digital world still not well understood by professional sports clubs or their governing bodies.Where, in his mind, might the crypto-fication of football end up? “My dream is that one day we would launch a Socios Cup, and the starting XIs would be decided entirely by fans,” Dreyfus says.The question of who would get sacked if the team lost is a question for another day."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1467a74c1101f1a2a503a87568ace9a8b1f5a613/32_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2954732ca2099c8ca0b649f254ec3252","title":"the outer worlds review obsidan entertainment","story":"PC, PS4, Nintendo Switch, Xbox One Obsidian EntertainmentMore than just Fallout in space, this action-RPG is a delightful sci-fi romp with razor-sharp writing, lashings of humour and enough content to entertain you for monthsSet in an unspecified future in which humankind has begun to colonise other planets, The Outer Worlds is easy to describe but in no way derivative. In essence, as a single-player, first-person action-RPG, it’s Fallout in space. There is a steampunk vibe, as well as art direction that harks back to 1950s sci-fi comics such as Dan Dare and The Eagle. But the look, feel and game world are distinctive and fully realised, and it addresses modern concerns, such as the disasters that happen when mega-corporations assume the role of governments.In the star system of Halcyon, the furthest colony from Earth, a giant ship called the Hope, packed with hundreds of thousands of colonists in suspended animation, has been abandoned in space for inexplicable bureaucratic reasons. Phineas Welles, a sort of dissident mad-scientist adventurer, locates it and wakes up one person on board: your character.In classic RPG fashion, you can decide which gender you want to be and allocate a bunch of skill points, before Welles whisks you off to a nearby planet where he has freelancer Captain Hawthorne standing by with a ship to help you. Unfortunately, Hawthorne proves not to be the brightest star in the galaxy and is crushed by your pod when it lands on his beacon. So you must work your way to his ship by performing helpful missions for the locals, before contacting Welles to find out what to do next.What ensues is a delightful sci-fi romp with razor-sharp writing, lashings of humour and immaculately observed characters that put most game franchises to shame. The gameplay is well crafted, too. Although its shooting engine – which provides an assortment of ever more exotic weaponry and features a time-slowing mechanic – does feel like Fallout, albeit simplified and honed, it is augmented by modding, skill and perk systems that avoid the baffling arcaneness that can afflict similarly ambitious RPGs.It’s not all just about shooting: you can employ stealth, often have to partake in mild puzzle-solving, and dialogue with other characters emerges as a key element. As you progress, you accumulate a band of assistants whose equipment and fighting styles you can influence, each of whom has some drama going on in which you can get involved, triggering stories that feel like mini-soap operas.Each of the planets in Halcyon is run by a different corporation – one churning out canned food, for example, and another meds – and you begin to encounter groups who have escaped the corporate yoke. All the planets, meanwhile, have a problem with aggressive outlaws and dangerous wildlife. Your overarching mission is to subvert the Board, which controls the various corporations and has clearly been running Halcyon into the ground, before reanimating the settlers on the Hope in the expectation that they will run Halcyon in a less venal, money-grabbing and authoritarian manner.Apart from the fabulous art and attention to detail in the myriad compelling missions (even the quests that stray into fetch-and-carry territory prove fun), what really marks out The Outer Worlds as a special experience is the way in which, right from the start, it somehow feels cosy, inviting and, despite its stylised air, curiously plausible. Its characters are so well-written that it’s easy to become emotionally involved with them, and the game plays on that by confronting you with occasional dilemmas.It’s huge and sprawling, with enough content to keep you immersed for weeks or even months, but it is also something of a holy grail for action-RPGs: although there is a complicated set of systems, with vast amounts of gear, armour and weaponry to loot, it is never complicated to play.The Outer Worlds is vital proof that mid-sized indie teams can take on the big guns at their own game, and leave them looking a little foolish. It provides the most enjoyable dose of escapism I have encountered this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/019a761714c550ee7d1cacc9e2742a4994b18d01/1147_308_3242_1945/master/3242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=389ed8c5f1174389698302f4f73756cf","title":"john humphrys returns to radio classic fm","story":"Ex-Today presenter takes temporary role filling in on Classic FM breakfast showWhen he retired from Radio 4’s Today programme last month, John Humphrys might have been expected to take the opportunity to have a lie-in after 32 years of early morning starts.Instead, he has already announced his return to the radio with a stint filling in as host of Classic FM’s breakfast show, swapping heated interviews with leading politicians for a job introducing pieces of calming classical music.Humphrys will present the programme for a week from Monday 28 October between 6am and 9am, filling in for usual presenter Tim Lihoreau.He said: “I’m struggling to think of a greater contrast with my old job: the bliss of Beethoven and Brahms instead of Brexit and backstops!

There is a string quartet called The Four Quarters, for instance, and a violin concerto with the subtitle Concentric Paths. But his latest work comes with no suggestive name it is a piano concerto, pure and simple. First performed in Boston last March, the concerto was the centrepiece of Adès’s concert with the London Philharmonic and with soloist Kirill Gerstein, for whom it was written.The concerto certainly does what it says on the label: a three-movement form with rampaging outer movements and a reflective central andante, it often sounds like wrong-note Rachmaninov. There are echoes of other 20th-century composers, too – such as Prokofiev, Britten and Ligeti – as if it was a commentary on the art of concerto writing in the wake of late Romanticism, a demonstration there is still some mileage in the rhetoric of that lost era. There’s plenty of ferocious solo writing, which Gerstein clearly relished, and some metrical intricacies for the orchestra to negotiate, but too much seems overly insistent, as if determined to batter the audience into approval.Holst’s suite The Planets followed the premiere, but Adès had begun with a much less familiar work. Compared with Sibelius’s other tone poems, Nightride and Sunrise is rarely performed, and it’s easy to know why. For a composer who was such a master of organic musical development, it is a curiously piecemeal work, and almost seems like a set of sketches for a symphony yet to be written. It’s by no means straightforward to perform, either. The London Philharmonic rose to those challenges, but it all seemed a bit of an effort.

I was a great admirer of his solo work, Street Hassle in particular (I came later to the Velvet Underground), so I went over and introduced myself. I was in Los Angeles working on the post-production of Raging Bull and I invited Lou to join us as we played back the final mix, the only time we actually screened the film on the west coast. When the lights came up, he seemed fairly overwhelmed. I remember that he was even impressed with the use of music, from Mascagni to Louis Prima.After the screening, I happened to mention to Lou that I wanted to make a film out of a short story called In Dreams Begin Responsibilities by Delmore Schwartz, which I had read the year before when Bob De Niro and I were working on the script. I was amazed when he told me that he’d been a student of Schwartz’s at Syracuse University, and he was just as amazed that I knew this autobiographical story by his mentor, the man who gave him a foundation in poetry, and that it had resonated so deeply for me. Later, I thought about adapting In Dreams for my contribution to New York Stories. I’d still like to make that film one day.Lou’s lyrics have two lives: as they are sung and heard, and as they are read on the printed page. And I think that they could only have come from someone who grew up in the New York area and came of age in Manhattan, who moved and wrote and sang from the pulse of life in this city. They describe the city as it was but they also incarnate it. You feel it in the rhythms (for instance, the driving rhythm of Street Hassle set by the string section, or the propulsive guitars on the live version of Sweet Jane, to name two favourites), you feel it in Lou’s voice, and you feel it in those words – really, they’re all one and the same. It’s essential New York speech, and it feels so close to what I was always trying to do in my own pictures, in the way the characters speak to each other and express themselves. You read or listen to the words and you see those people, hanging out or waiting or hustling on street corners or talking in tenement halls or going out on the boulevard.Take this section of Street Hassle, about a woman who’s OD’d and the hustler she picked up who’s stuck trying to get rid of her body:You know, some people got no choice And they can never find a voice To talk with that they can even call their own So the first thing they seeThat allows them the right to beWhy they follow it, you know, it’s called bad luck.Lou and I got to know each other over the years. I was so touched when he wrote a song about me and Sam Shepard on his 1984 album New Sensations – actually, it was about our work and how much it meant to him. In 1987, he auditioned for the role of Pontius Pilate in my film The Last Temptation of Christ, but his old friend David Bowie ended up playing the part. In the 90s, we tried to get a film made based on Dirty Boulevard from Lou’s album New York, from a script by Reinaldo Povod, who had written a play called Cuba and His Teddy Bear with Bob De Niro and who later passed away at a very young age. We were never able to get that picture into production.When I got the news that Lou had died, I was absolutely shocked. We had lost touch and I had no idea that he had been so sick. He was a great singer, a great writer, a great New York artist … a great artist, period. He actually spoke and sang in the voice of the lowest of the low, the dregs, the “least among us” – the people looking to follow the first thing that gives them the right to be. He spoke the language of people with nothing but their own humanity, and he elevated them. His words and his music – sometimes as close to everyday life as breathing – inspired many, many people over the years. I’m one of them.Taken from an updated edition of I’ll Be Your Mirror by Lou Reed, published 7 November by Faber."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1782e916768b06b90372556a89bb22bff739225/0_73_3649_2190/master/3649.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13d4b7026d6f460e065378f4451d600a","title":"is this the end of the road for remainers podcast","story":"Jonathan Freedland joins Anushka Asthana to discuss how the pro-EU movement has grown in numbers and developed its own political identity based around opposing Brexit.

In a week that could determine the Brexit outcome, Jonathan Freedland joins Anushka Asthana to discuss whether remainers are running out of road.  Also today, Denise Phelan welcomes the decriminalisation of abortion in Northern Ireland as the Democratic Unionist party returns to the mothballed debating chamber at Stormont to protest against it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1204454c524ad308b42c75d506fc00ab3241a897/0_162_4874_2924/master/4874.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97aed4c69b9c34c34950561cc175d35b","title":"labour unveils plans for carbon neutral energy system by 2030s","story":"Strategy includes 30 recommendations including insulation upgrades for every home in UKLabour will unveil plans to create a carbon-neutral energy system by the 2030s including insulation upgrades for every home in the UK and enough new solar panels to cover 22,000 football pitches.The party will set out its fast-track climate strategy on Thursday after adopting plans to work towards a net-zero carbon economy two decades ahead of the government’s legally binding 2050 target.The plan includes 30 recommendations to tackle emissions from the energy system, including home energy efficiency upgrades such as insulation and double glazing that will focus first on damp homes and areas suffering fuel poverty.The party also plans to install 8m electric heat pumps to help wean Britain off its use of gas heating, and build another 7,000 offshore and 2,000 onshore wind turbines to help clean up the UK’s electricity supply.Rebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, said the report would kickstart Labour’s Green Industrial Revolution – but the next five years will be crucial. “The Labour party has among the most ambitious climate targets in the world and is the only party turning their targets into detailed, credible plans to tackle the climate and environmental crisis,” she said.“The recommendations in this report could put the UK on track for a zero-carbon energy system during the 2030s, but only if rapid progress is made early on. The next five years are therefore crucial.”The plan emerged after the party revealed a wide-ranging set of climate measures at its party conference in Brighton last month. They included a £250bn transformation fund to help drive its plans for a “green industrial revolution”, including a £3.4bn national network of electric vehicle charging points and a vow to ban sales of new fossil fuel cars by 2030.The economic predictions were prepared by a team of economists at the Sustainability Research Institute, backed by the University of Leeds, who were tasked with analysing the impact of the plans over the decade from 2020 to 2030.Labour’s plan also has the backing of a panel of energy experts and academics who have signed up to a statement in support of the plan. The statement confirms that Labour’s energy plan is “feasible” and does not rely on “clearly implausible or inappropriate” measures to increase the UK’s low-carbon energy by 2030. Long-Bailey said the party was working with trade unions to “ensure that the changes to our energy system will be planned democratically, with the interests of workers and local communities at the heart of the transition”.Rebecca Newsom, head of politics at Greenpeace UK, said “the bold report” showed the scale of investment that will be required to deal with the climate emergency.“The report is right to say that we can’t hit net zero if we don’t immediately get on with delivering lots more renewable power, insulating homes and buildings and trialling at scale the potential solutions to heat decarbonisation. This all costs money, but investing more now will bring enormous benefits,” she said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66a78f1ffe68ef3a3e1e1e37f0d8996758f47a4d/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5de1ee9da5990412aa67fc116409740","title":"sick of it cheshire town fatigued and divided by brexit","story":"Local MP Antoinette Sandbach lost the Tory whip over her Brexit stance but she says she represents the views of her constituentsWinsford is not one of Cheshire’s stereotypically leafy, affluent communities. An overspill town from Liverpool and home to the UK’s largest salt mine, Antoinette Sandbach thinks it is one of the most pro-Brexit parts of her sprawling rural constituency of Eddisbury.On Tuesday evening, the rebel MP voted in favour of the government’s Brexit deal, but joined Labour MPs and fellow ex-Tories to block its proposed fast-track timetable. On Wednesday morning, shoppers in Winsford’s precinct were split on whether it was the right move.Eileen Barnabas, 82, voted remain and supports her MP’s call for a second referendum. “There’s so many people who will be affected if we do come out,” she says, and in the event of no deal, “it would be worse again”.She thinks the parliamentary shenanigans have been “ludicrous”, and is unsure how she’d vote in a general election: “I used to vote Labour but I’m not too happy with them, but I certainly wouldn’t vote Conservative.”Leanne Dickinson, 55, was not eligible to vote in the referendum because she’s a Dutch citizen. However, she’s grateful for her MP’s actions on behalf of her children, who she says are staunch remainers, and is also hoping for a second referendum.“Lots of people have an idea that the UK can go back to the good old days and this belief that everything in the UK is really, really great … and it isn’t,” she says. “When people voted for leaving, they weren’t voting against the EU, but more about issues within the UK.”Vernon adds: “To be honest, I just want it over and done with … and take the consequences.” He says he would probably vote for Boris Johnson in a general election, although Moss says she’d vote with the rest of her Labour-supporting family.Dilip Solanki-Koli, 64, groaned when Brexit was mentioned. A refugee from Uganda in the 70s, the army veteran was selling poppies in the shopping centre when the  spoke to him. He served in Northern Ireland and says he doesn’t want anything to threaten peace in the region but says he’s “sick of it”.He adds: “The country voted to come out and the politicians are just playing games.” He won’t say how he voted in the referendum but says he won’t take part in an election. “Parliament is not doing what it’s supposed to,” he says. “They’re supposed to represent the people, but they’re not at the moment. I’m not going to vote at all.”Sandbach says her office runs regular surveys asking constituents what they think and is confident she continues to represent those views in Westminster. She objects to her depiction in some of the press as an “arch-remoaner”, pointing out that she has voted in favour of a deal to leave at “every single opportunity”. She says: “I’ve rebelled on process and I believe that parliament should have a say. I’m protecting parliamentary sovereignty against the executive.”She says she is appealing against the withdrawal of the Conservative whip and won’t be drawn on whether she’ll stand as an independent MP if she is not accepted back into the party. She thinks Brexit has “broken down the old party loyalties” and her “principled stance” has earned her respect. “People have genuinely seen that I’ve been willing to put my job on the line for their interests. And there aren’t many MPs that do that.”One of those is Steve Connor, CEO of a communications agency. He lives in a village outside Malpas, where some of Sandbach’s relatives’ names are displayed on the war memorial. Connor, 50, is a lifelong Labour voter and ardent remainer, but admires the “bravery” and “leadership” the MP has shown. He feels “totally disenfranchised” and admits he would feel torn in a general election. “If I was faced with a choice of a strongly anti no-deal, anti-Brexit rebel Tory v a Labour Brexiteer, I’d have no choice. I’d be voting, for the first time in my life, not Labour but for an ex-Tory.”Although he disagrees politically with many of his neighbours, he says “there is no culture war going on”. “My neighbours are still my neighbours, we still have our kids in the same swim team and we have so many values in common.”Sandbach says she is exhausted by the vitriol and “the hate”. She adds: “Frankly, whatever happens in the election, I know that I will have left my mark on Eddisbury, because I got some really major projects through that will change people’s lives locally. And that’s why I do my job.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b858b0d5940afd442f1b5baf785b9dcd68e1fb17/45_84_839_503/master/839.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6d54547c21fb831cc8dd4cb609121b7","title":"dogs show nose archaeology sniffing out ancient tombs","story":"Trained canines help locate burial sites dating back to the iron age in CroatiaThe scent-tracking abilities of trained dogs have helped archaeologists discover iron age tombs in Croatia dating back nearly three thousand years.The dogs sniffed out burial chests containing human bones and artefacts in a hilltop fort in the Velebit mountains along the Adriatic coast. Experts have said that using dogs could be a good way to identify archaeological sites, as it is less destructive than many traditional methods.“Dogs’ noses obviously don’t make mistakes,” said Vedrana Glavaš, an associate professor of archaeology at the University of Zadar in Croatia and the lead author of the study, which was published in the Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory.Glavaš had already found a few tombs in a necropolis near the prehistoric hilltop fort of Drvišica, which dates back to the eight century BC. Hoping to find more, she contacted Andrea Pintar, a trainer who works with dogs used for sniffing out graves in criminal investigations.Pintar brought Belgian malinois and German shepherds to the remote site in 2015. Glavaš first sent the dogs to graves they had dug up the previous year but which were not apparent, without telling the trainers the location.“We always use at least two dogs to confirm the position,” Glavaš said, adding that the second trainer and dog were not told where the first dog and trainer had indicated a grave.The canines discovered all three graves, even though the human remains, associated artefacts and surrounding soil had been removed. The area had also been exposed to wind, sun and rain since the excavation.Glavaš said the porous rock around the excavated soil had probably absorbed enough of the aroma of decomposition that the dogs could still detect it.Glavaš then let the dogs loose in an area they suspected more remains could be found, and excavated six new tombs – five of which are described in the recent paper.The dogs were extremely accurate in every case. The tombs consist of small stone burial chests in the middle of walled stone circles, each about five metres in diameter. Each chest contained small bones such as the fingers and feet of several iniduals – perhaps several generations from the same family – along with buckles and other artefacts.Glavaš said the people in the site were probably fairly poor due to the harsh, windy climate of the area and the difficulty of growing crops.While Glavaš has used dogs successfully in other sites in Croatia and Germany, she has yet to excavate some of the tombs located by them in Drvišica due to a lack of time and money.Angela Perri, a postdoctoral archaeology researcher at Durham University who was not involved in the study, said using dogs to sniff out burials was an especially promising technique as it is non-destructive and can be used in situations where ground-penetrating radar or other techniques may not work.“It would be interesting to push the boundaries on that and see just how old you could get,” she said. “It seems like a pretty great way to move forward in archaeology.”Perri, who studies the ancient history of how humans first began to domesticate and use dogs, said the technique was just the latest in humans’ long history of using dogs as biotechnology. “We’re still finding new ways of having dogs help us,” she said.Glavaš believes archaeologists could use dogs in numerous different contexts. “Many archaeologists are looking for burial sites of settlements,” she said. “I think dogs can solve their problems.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f98d50e894f96771901c8355dddf2bc626b5157/0_566_6604_3962/master/6604.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8db0d583bc5e1bd42ec3b3f42fb080eb","title":"people revolted mooncup bust period taboos","story":"The makers of the silicone menstrual cup had to overcome disgust and suspicion when they launched the company two decades ago. Now they are busy breaking new barriersThere was a time in the early 2000s when it felt as though no public toilet was safe from the guerrilla stickering of Mooncup fans. Festivals, university loos, clubs and pubs – if someone could be sat with their knickers down, then the chances are there would be a little white sticker in front of them offering a “safer, greener, cheaper” period.Except they didn’t use the word period back then. In 2002, when Mooncup – the world’s first reusable silicone menstrual cup – was launched by two women in Brighton, the word was still taboo. “People were revolted by what we were doing,” says Eileen Greene, one of the founders and directors of the company. “People really weren’t talking about periods at all. We were quite radical. We would do stalls at festivals and trade shows and we would call it the ‘repulsion zone’ – this semicircle around the stall where people wouldn’t even want to come near us.”What a difference 17 years make. I meet Greene and Kath Clements – another of Mooncup’s directors, who joined in 2005, in their Brighton offices. They have outgrown the bedroom in the Whitehawk estate where the company was founded, when a team of two were cramped between piles of leaflets, cups and stickers. Now a 40-strong outfit, Mooncup has a proper office and a kitchen with a long wooden table, which is where the staff cook and eat a vegan lunch together every day. They do yoga here, too, and meditation. “It’s just what we’ve always done,” says Greene.If you are unfamiliar with the Mooncup, think of it as a bendy silicone eggcup, that, when inserted into the vagina, collects menstrual blood. You can leave it in for around eight hours, because it holds about three times as much fluid as a regular tampon. When you take it out, you just tip the blood away, give it a rinse (a water bottle will do if you don’t want to use the public sink) and reinsert it. Each Mooncup lasts for about 10 years, so the £22 price tag should recoup itself after six months of saving on other sanitary products. I have a friend who has been using one since her teens and, now in her mid 30s, has only ever spent about £40 on her period in her whole life. Then, of course, there is the environmental benefit of ridding the world of the estimated 200,000 tonnes of sanitary waste that ends up in landfill in the UK each year.This month marks a major turning point, too: for the first time since the product’s launch, the packaging has been redesigned to show the cup on the front of the box. “We’ve always had a white box with a flower on it,” says Greene. “Which was a way of saying: ‘Look, this isn’t a scary thing.’ Now, we feel able to be more up front.”In the past decade there has been a dramatic cultural shift away from the hushed tones and euphemisms used for anything related to a woman’s menstrual cycle. “In 2015, you could really see the taboo around periods starting to break,” says Clements. She points to the tennis player Heather Watson saying that she performed poorly in the Australian Open because of her period and the musician Kiran Gandhi, who ran the London Marathon free bleeding, as key moments in changing public discourse around menstruation that year. “And we’d played our part in that – very committedly trying to shift the conversation around periods,” she says. But she emphasises that this is a shift restricted to the UK: “Because in many countries, it is not the case at all.” The first menstrual cup was invented by an American actor, Leona Chalmers, who patented her runner cup in 1937. Greene stumbled on the idea in the late 1990s, when a woman on a Critical Mass bike ride through London told her about them. “I was like: ‘Wow, I’ve never heard of anything like that.’” A year later, Greene went travelling around Australia. “I was camping in Boonoo Boonoo national park and opposite me was this British family. There was a woman washing reusable nappies in a bucket – which you really didn’t see very often back then, and I was intrigued.” That woman was Su Hardy, whom Greene would tell about the menstrual cup. Hardy was so enthralled that, when she got back to the UK, she managed to track one down in the US. “At that time, they were fairly rudimentary rubber cups. She started importing them on a small scale, and selling then to friends of friends. They were OK, but some people had a reaction to the latex, so that got her thinking: ‘How can I improve this? And she came up with the idea of making it from medical-grade silicone instead. She made it a 21st-century product.” By this point, Hardy had moved to Brighton and the fledgling business operated out of her house. “It was so chaotic,” says Clements. “You couldn’t even move your chair.” The stickers were Hardy’s idea. “Su’s one-woman crusade,” laughs Clements. “She was going around stickering public toilets. Every day, she’d run off to the post office with this wicker basket full of orders. Each Mooncup would come with a sticker, so our users started stickering, too. “It’s such a different concept to the tampons and pads that we’ve all been used to using. People really need to hear it from someone else.”There was a natural hesitance among consumers, whose relationship with tampon brands is often embedded in their school years. “I remember the Tampax lady coming into our school really fondly – which shows how clever they are about it,” says Clements. It must be galling, then, to see rival menstrual cups flooding a market that they created. How do they feel about Tampax launching its own menstrual cup? “They have clearly seen a commercial opportunity, that times are changing, and they’ve jumped on the bandwagon,” says Greene. Tampax’s product, however, not only comes in a plastic container, but plastic packaging, too. “You would have hoped they would focus on eliminating single-use plastic. That would be a diligent environmental approach, rather than just adding another product to the range.”As for the other brands, Clements thinks it is worth cautiously celebrating that their efforts have “transformed the feminine hygiene aisle”. Yet she warns that companies should also be thinking about “where it’s being manufactured and if colours are being added to it. Also, I’ve seen some brands saying they need replacing every year, and some that come in plastic packaging.”This distaste for waste is the reason Mooncup will not be expanding its range, says Greene. “We won’t make wipes or washes – those paraphernalia of consumerism – because they are simply not needed.”When Hardy retired in 2014, she transferred ownership of the business to the employees. Even the salaries are shared openly. “I sometimes forget that this is quite radical practice,” says Clements. Has it even been fraught? It can, she admits, be challenging at times. “People bring a lot of personal feeling to conversations around money.”I wonder if there was any disharmony about the decision to sell via Asos, given the criticism of the company’s record on workers’ rights and its warehouses, which have been described as “dark satanic mills” by unions. “They are clearly striving to improve,” says Greene. “From our perspective, it felt like an opportunity to reach a whole new demographic.”Aside from the fact some women may still feel squeamish about the idea of such close contact with menstrual blood (which users say is minimal), there are few criticisms of Mooncup. But it is not advisable for use in places where there is no clean water to sterilise it, or if an internal product is not suitable, says Greene.In recent years, the company has ventured into advertising (working with an advertising agency that had been run as a workers’ cooperative) but the directors are wary of pushing their ethical credentials too far. “There are so many voices claiming that they believe in a cause,” says Clements. So they took a different approach. Firstly, it was the Love Your Vagina posters – which got them into hot water after people complained to the Advertising Standards Authority about the word “vagina” being on a poster. Then there was 2015’s “Period Drama” – which poked fun at Poldark, by featuring a weak maiden on the back of a horse with a man, galloping to find her the right tampons when all she really needs is her Mooncup. “The aim was to allow space for the more complex feminist conversations to happen within advertising,” says Clements.In fact, the filming of the advert turned into a feminist drama in itself. “When the trainer of the horse realised the job was for a sanitary product advert, he pulled out at the last minute. Because he thought the reputation of his horse would be sullied,” Clements says with a laugh.I can’t leave without telling the founders the only negative story I managed to extract from the dozens of Mooncup users I spoke to (who were all evangelical about its benefits). It was from a friend who said that, in 10 years, she had only “had one leak,” but described it as “apocalyptic”. “With a tampon,” she pointed out “you might get a dribble with a Mooncup it’s a small cupful.”“Hmm,” says Clements, thoughtfully. “Leakage usually happens at the beginning. That’s why we have the phone support service to help people who are new to using the cup. Often people place it too high up the vagina, because it’s instinctively where you would put your tampon. Instead, you wear it lower to form a seal with the vaginal wall.” She seems genuinely perplexed and promises to look into the matter.As for the future, what is next for Mooncup is flaunting the new packaging, and trying to reach as many people as possible. Do Clements and Greene ever get bored of talking about periods all day long? “It’s funny if you’ve been working at a festival for a few days,” says Clements. “At the end of the week, you often don’t know people’s names. But you know everybody’s gynaecological history.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb4f7b9df89ce9b7ea70ae74cd517cd05299fa82/0_269_5460_3276/master/5460.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80b4a49ed91a5928d2b6bc2d1a326bb0","title":"england new zealand weight rugby world cup semi final","story":"Statistics show weights have hugely increased since New Zealand’s Twickenham World Cup win over England 28 years agoWhen people talk about the changing shape of rugby union they are not wrong. Statistics compiled by the  have found England and New Zealand players are, on average, between 1st 10lb and 2st (11-13kg) heavier per man compared with their counterparts in their first World Cup meeting in 1991.While it is well known the switch to professionalism in 1995 prompted advances in fitness and conditioning, the increased weight is increasingly striking. England’s 1991 team, considered big by the standards of the day, weighed 14st 8lb (94.3kg) on average, compared with 16st 6lb (105.8kg) in 2019.The All Blacks’ starting XV has bulked up from 14st 3lb (91.6kg) per man to 16st 4lb (104.6kg) at this tournament. Even the biggest England players of 1991 such as the 17st 5lb (112kg) Wade Dooley, known as the Blackpool Tower, would now be several kilos lighter than all four of England’s specialist locks at this tournament while loosehead prop Jason Leonard, at 105kg, would be 18kg lighter than his modern-day counterpart Mako Vunipola.It is much the same story in the back ision. In 1991 only one of England’s backs – wing Chris Oti – weighed more than 88kg. That is less than every single current England starting back, including scrum-half Ben Youngs, with the 112kg Manu Tuilagi weighing 28kg more than England’s erstwhile inside-centre Jeremy Guscott.The trend among leading New Zealand players is very similar, with even their electric full-back Beauden Barrett, at 92kg, some 13kg heavier than his predecessor Terry Wright. Only at scrum-half where the previous incumbent Graeme Bachop tipped the scales at 82kg, exactly the same as Aaron Smith, are the two eras remotely comparable.When the big changes in muscle density and body fat measurements among current professional players are also taken into account, not to mention the law changes that have led to a sharply increased number of collisions and breakdowns, the generational difference is even more marked.The All Blacks’ hooker Sean Fitzpatrick, who was considered a significant physical presence in his day, weighed 93kg. These days his successors, Dane Coles and Codie Taylor, both weigh 110kg while England’s Jamie George and Luke Cowan-Dickie weigh 109kg.England, whose starting quarter-final XV against Australia weighed a combined 1,587kg, compared with the All Blacks’ total versus Ireland of 1,569kg, will be hoping this weekend produces a rather more satisfying outcome than in 1991. On that occasion the All Blacks won the opening pool game at Twickenham between the two nations 18-12, thanks to a try from flanker Michael Jones and 14 points from the boot of Grant Fox. England’s points came from three penalties by Jonathan Webb and a Rob Andrew drop goal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2414043a699f5535ed09e307923390ea048e582d/497_238_3748_2250/master/3748.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1ad3687b4b150ae47fec56f1ec663b6","title":"talking horses magical heads strong breeders cup squad aidan obrien horse racing tips","story":"Magical is expected to make the final start of her career in the Breeders’ Cup Filly \u0026amp Mare Turf at Santa Anita on Saturday weekMagical, who was hailed as the “ultimate racehorse” after winning the Champion Stakes at Ascot last Saturday, is expected to make the final start of her career in the Breeders’ Cup Filly \u0026amp Mare Turf at Santa Anita on Saturday week, Aidan O’Brien, her trainer, confirmed on Wednesday.Magical has won four of her 14 starts in Group One contests and finished second behind the outstanding Enable in three more. The Breeders’ Cup Turf, over a mile-and-a-half, is her official “first preference” for next week’s two-day meeting in California, but O’Brien will run Anthony Van Dyck, the Derby winner this year, in that race and attempt to win a first Filly \u0026amp Mare Turf with his talented and adaptable four-year-old filly.O’Brien’s runners, as so often, are the backbone of the European challenge at this year’s Breeders’ Cup, with his Ballydoyle stable likely to field runners in all seven of the meeting’s turf events. His long-standing ambition to win the Classic on dirt, however, will not be realised this year as the weekend’s feature race has no European entries.O’Brien warned that “a horse can change in 24 hours at this time of the year” but assuming that Magical lines up at Santa Anita, it will be the second year in a row that she has raced at all four of the biggest autumn meetings at Leopardstown, Longchamp, Ascot and in America. She will also be contesting a Group One race for the seventh month in a row, a sequence stretching back to her win in the Tattersalls Gold Cup in May.Magical is second-favourite at around 9-4 to end her career with a fifth top-level win, in a market headed by last year’s winner Sistercharlie at 15-8. O’Brien also has a strong hand in the Juvenile Turf where Arizona, second behind Pinatubo in the Dewhurst Stakes earlier this month, is the early favourite. Jessica Harrington’s Albigna heads the market for the Juvenile Fillies’ Turf while two more O’Brien-trained colts, Anthony Van Dyck and Circus Maximus, are favourites for the Turf and Mile respectively.In all, there are 32 horses from British and Irish stables among the likely runners at Santa Anita next week, with other familiar names including Billesdon Brook, last year’s 1,000 Guineas winner, who will give Sean Levey a first ride at the meeting in the Filly \u0026amp Mare Turf.A’Ali, the Norfolk Stakes winner at Royal Ascot, is one of two likely runners for Simon Crisford in the Juvenile Turf Sprint and a confirmed ride for Frankie Dettori, while Dr Simpson (Tom Dascombe), Dream Shot (James Tate) and Band Practice (Archie Watson) have also made it into the probable field next Friday.The Breeders’ Cup returns to Santa Anita for the first time since 2016 following a difficult time for the track in the first half of the year, when the deaths of 30 horses either during racing or training turned a harsh spotlight on welfare standards at one of America’s most famous venues.The Breeders’ Cup committee considered moving to an alternative venue but voted unanimously in June to keep the meeting at a course that has hosted the event more frequently than any other American track.Craig Fravel, the president and chief executive of the Breeders’ Cup, said that a number of new initiatives have been introduced at the course for its autumn season, which opened in September. Two horses have died during races since the start of the current season, while two more have suffered fatal injuries while training.“No jurisdiction in the world has been safer than southern California since the beginning of June,” Fravel said. “The California Horse Racing Board, horsemen in California, Santa Anita and its staff have done extraordinary work in screening horses and instituting new protocols. No stone has been left unturned to make sure that safety is the first priority.“There will be a team of 14 veterinarians at Santa Anita all week and all runners have to be there 72 hours out, so that they are available for inspection and review. There will also be 20 veterinarians on duty on the racing days.”Jamie Snowden has a couple of interesting runners at Southwell today, both representing him for the first time after switching to his yard from Kate Buckett in the off-season. Tractor Fred in the second race is probably best watched but Battleofthesomme (1.40) could be worth an interest on this chasing debut and the market certainly seems to think so, as he’s halved in price to 7-1.He showed a very little promise in his early novice hurdles and should appreciate this step back in trip. Snowden has had four winners from 14 runners in the past fortnight.Global Citizen (2.25) might have sufficient pace for a hot novice chase at Carlisle, for which he’s 5-2.  Boulot Dodo (4.35) should be better for his reappearance run and can land a handicap hurdle at 3-1.The nap is Big Boris (5.00) at 7-2 for Chelmsford’s opener, in which David Evans’s juvenile should benefit for the extra quarter-mile after a pleasing nursery debut at Chepstow."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fad592326aa4b4d1119203892ab30a3f76cbff0b/0_340_5101_3061/master/5101.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f5c5249519f8de2d4878870a1997165","title":"parliament ecb gamble the hundred cricket","story":"A few years back the former boss of Barclays, Bob Diamond, gave a masterclass in how not to appear before a Commons select committee.

Led by the chairman, Colin Graves, and Tom Harrison, the suave chief executive, they did it right. They were respectful and courteous. They exhausted the Thesaurus with adulatory synonyms about their own achievements – “phenomenal” was the favourite. And they swerved the difficult questions with practised skill.It was so cleverly done that one suspects the elderly gent with an MCC handkerchief in his top pocket sitting behind Graves was in fact an ECB plant to illustrate the enemy.Almost nothing its three-man team said made any sense whatever – their teammate Clare Connor, talking about the growth of women’s cricket, was much more credible. But it didn’t matter. Parliament is full of cricket enthusiasts, several of them on the panel at the culture select committee on Wednesday. (The ECB, in contrast, specialises in politicians.) The MPs do not like to think badly of a game they love, and were over-respectful in return.And they were not well enough briefed to get behind the bland evasions to reach the nub of what every sane person in cricket knows (even those who dare not say it) – that the ECB’s strategy of forcing its new hyped-up contest The Hundred on an unwilling game is completely incoherent, staggeringly expensive and potentially disastrous.This point was made later by Andy Nash, the former chairman of Somerset and ECB member, who has resigned and gone rogue. Nash described the project as a “reckless gamble”. A public debate between Nash and Graves would have been worth hearing. But it did not happen.Nonetheless, this was a far more edifying occasion than The Daft – sorry Draft – the Sky programme shown on Sunday night when players were allocated between the eight new teams, all of them deeply rooted in the ECB marketing department. In style, it was aimed at the nine-year-olds who are the alleged target audience.But they would have been the kind of nine-year-olds who speculate on the bitcoin market. This had nothing to do with cricket and everything to do with money. Not the money English cricket might make to develop the game – but the millions it is spaffing on coaches (almost all foreign) and players (mostly not).For them it’s bonanza time. And the homegrown chosen ones will become a new rich elite of 100-ball and Twenty20 specialists, playing in the selected big cities, leaving behind a load of poor saps playing the 50-over and four-day cricket that produces World Cup and Ashes wins. Screw all that.Sky is not to blame for this. It loves long games to fill its infinite airtime. The whole Hundred concept appears to derive from a bizarre coalition between the board and, of all people, the BBC, which has bought ten games, men’s and women’s, on the understanding that they will not exceed a three-hour slot, which Twenty20 usually does.The ECB is now so guilty about the original decision to remove the game from mainstream TV 14 years ago that it has absurdly convinced itself this pathetic allocation will somehow create a new cricketing generation, even though most will still be barred from seeing anything of consequence. And the BBC, its portfolio of live sport now largely empty, is gleefully co-operating.There was one telling moment at Westminster. It came from Lord Patel, the ECB’s senior non-executive director. Asked why the professional game was unrepresented on the board he replied: “My experience of having representative committees has always been that it doesn’t produce the best outcomes.”Oh, I know. The boss of the Chinese Communist party was saying just the same to me the other day. That tedious democracy stuff, it’s so 20th century. Much better to leave things to people who know best, like Lord Patel.There were good ways to move this game forward. The know-alls bet everything on a bad one. Andy Nash hinted that the first-class counties were now considering plans to regain control of their own destiny. But that is two years and hundreds of millions too late.From here, there are only two outcomes. Either The Hundred flops and cricket is plunged into an unprecedented financial crisis. Or it can be painted as a success (stand by for free tickets) and the much-loved sport on which it is loosely based will wither into something as relevant as knur-and-spell. Completely subordinate to made-up teams playing a made-up game to sell junk food to children. Me, I hope it rains solidly for the next four Augusts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af9814d4f9dd5943e526aa600aafe92b59adea6f/0_0_4469_2682/master/4469.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd3b994b09719d52536da5dacd7974f5","title":"apple watch series 5 review the king of smartwatches","story":"Always-on screen completes the package kicking competitors to the curb and becoming a top reason to buy an iPhoneWhen Apple launched its smartwatch in 2015 to a lukewarm reception, some critics claimed it would never take off like the iPod or iPhone. But sales of the Apple Watch quickly eclipsed every other smartwatch and with wearable technology sales soaring it is expected this year to outsell all of the Swiss watchmakers combined.The latest Apple Watch Series 5 iteration, though still pricey at £399 and up, looks likely to continue the firm’s domination of the smartwatch market and deservedly so.If you are unfamiliar with Apple’s smartwatches, they only work if you also have an Apple iPhone 6S or newer connecting to the smartphone via Bluetooth. It’s a genius link-up that ties buyers into the Apple ecosphere, while adding an important alternative revenue stream as people hold onto their phones. But that doesn’t take away from the extraordinary qualities of this watch.The Series 5 builds on last year’s larger-screen redesign of the Apple Watch, making one small but important change: the screen now stays on all the time.It’s a feature every other smartwatch has had for years and is important for actually telling the time, which is absolutely essential for something to have a permanent place on my wrist.Until now Apple Watch owners had to either tap the face or do an elaborate wrist rotation gesture to get the screen to light up – and it never worked when I really needed it to, such as when running for a train. Now you can see the time at a glance at any time or angle. The rest of the Apple Watch has always been top notch. Equipped with the right strap – if you haven’t tried the Sport Loop or one of its many clones you absolutely must – the Apple Watch is the most comfortable timepiece I’ve had the pleasure of strapping to my wrist, beating some of the very best the Swiss watchmakers have to offer.It’s neither heavy nor light, and hides the heart rate sensor in a curved lump on its belly comfortably sitting atop your wrist. It fits easily under shirt cuffs, which some larger smartwatches don’t. It’s water resistant to depths of 50m, which means you’ll likely never have to worry about it when you take a dip in the pool.The screen is bright and crisp, clearly visible in all circumstances. I’ve never been a massive fan of the rectangular shape, preferring my watches to be of the circular variety, but the Series 5 has won me round over the last month.Apple still leads the way on haptics – the little vibrations and taps the watch makes to let you know something has happened. I loved them with the original in 2015, and they’re still miles better than anything else on the market five generations later.One thing you might not appreciate until you strap one to your wrist is that there are so many of them out there in the wild, all looking the same. I’m not one to conform to any particular fashion or club, so I often get that twinge of embarrassment you feel when you walk into a room and spot someone wearing the same shirt or dress.It’s made a little better with the Series 5 now you can have the screen on all the time and pick a slightly different face, but by putting one on you instantly become one of the Apple Watch people.Apple provides loads of watch faces, which are all infinitely tweakable in colour, with many having dial customisation. Then there’s a sizeable collection of widgets for things like timers, the weather, activity and others called “complications”. But I’ve found there’s always something not quite perfect about each face that I can’t change. I love the new Numerals Duo face, but I wish it could have the date on it too. I really like the Meridian analogue face too, but wish it had an option for numerals not just ticks.I also find the round analogue faces hard to read at a glance even on the 44mm Series 5 because they’re just bit too small. I’m being picky here, but that’s the thing about something you wear – if it’s not quite how you want it you’re going to notice it and be annoyed by it over and over.Of course the Apple Watch does more than just tell the time. Notifications are a high point. A little tap on the wrist and you know something has happened. Most you can interact with in some way. All of Apple’s apps work well, of course, but so do third-party apps. The Nest and Ring apps show photos of events from cameras for instance.Messaging apps including Signal and WhatsApp can be marked as read or replied to straight from your wrist. You can dictate what you want to Siri, draw out letters one at a time or send canned responses or emojis.Most Apple Watch apps aren’t up to much, but one that bucks the trend is the Spotify app, which gives you full control of playback on your iPhone from your wrist, including volume control using the digital crown. But it can’t store music offline unlike the Apple Music app. Apple Pay on your wrist is great too. Double press the big side button to bring up the card and then just put it near the reader as you would a phone or contactless credit card.Siri is great when it works, but can be hamstrung by poor network conditions. “Hey, Siri” works fine, but activates fairly often when I don’t want it to, ditto for raising your wrist to speak to Siri. I deactivated both features and didn’t miss them. Setting timers, reminders, alarms and other bits via Siri work great, but things start to fall apart with more complex tasks or questions. It’s the same on an iPhone, more or less.There’s no Google Maps app on the Apple Watch, which is disappointing. Apple Maps is getting better, but it’s really not that great in the UK. Citymapper offers an Apple Watch app, which is certainly better for getting around London and other major cities.Apple has slowly turned its smartwatch into one of the best multipurpose fitness trackers available. You name it, the Apple Watch can track or record it, apart from one glaring omission: sleep.The workout app has modes to track a huge list of activities and sports, from your usual running, walking, hiking, cycling and swimming to yoga, tai chi, dance, football, badminton, hockey, table tennis and even fishing.The Apple Watch automatically looks out for some workouts too. I get a notification to track an outdoor walk twice a day on my commute, which I found annoying enough to turn the feature off.For running the Apple Watch is surprisingly good, tracking everything a mid-range dedicated Garmin running watch would, including performance stats such as VO2 Max. It’s got a long enough battery life with everything going to track a marathon, but I certainly feel it more as a lump on my wrist than my go-to Garmin Forerunner 235. There’s a dedicated Strava app for the Apple Watch if that’s your jam.Day-to-day health tracking is solid. The heart rate sensor measures your beats per minute throughout the day, logging it upwards of 12 times an hour or on-demand for you to view in the newly revitalised health app on your phone. But it can also notify you of abnormal heart rates, which are typically high when you’re not doing anything.You can also manually take an electrocardiogram (ECG) by placing your finger on the crown for 30 seconds or so. The apps shows you the waveform in real time and notifies you if your heart beat looks irregular.Other daily activity tracking takes the form of Apple’s activity rings: move in calories, exercise in minutes and stand in hours, complete with nags to stand up each hour if you haven’t already. Steps and distance are also recorded, along with flights of stairs climbed, and you get awards if you beat your goals. Exporting your activity is fairly restricted, but as all the data is stored in Apple Health you can connect to third-party apps.Included too are menstrual cycle tracking and fall detection. New for the Series 5 is the noise app, which monitors environmental noise and warns you if you’re in conditions that could damage your health. It also measures headphone volume on the iPhone, which may be just as useful for those listening to music too loudly.The Apple Watch Series 5 comes in two sizes, various different materials and models with the option of 4G.Since its second generation the Apple Watch has been the best smartwatch for the iPhone. But for the Series 5 that’s changed. It’s not just the best smartwatch for the iPhone. The Apple Watch is now a solid reason to buy an iPhone in the first place.The screen being on all the time that was the last piece in the Apple Watch puzzle. What started out as a bit of a let down in 2015 has since been refined, sped up and had meaningful features added to it that make it far more than the sum of its parts.After five generations Apple has finally nailed it, but that’s not to say the Series 5 is perfect. It would be great to have sleep tracking to close the circle on health tracking. It would be better if it lasted at least two days so you could go on a weekend away without bringing the charger.I wish there was a circular version too for variety, and it would be better for everyone if they didn’t all look the same like some sort of clone army. Strap one of these to your wrist and you become part of a tribe: the Apple Watch wearers.Then there’s the price. At £399 and up the Apple Watch Series 5 is in no way cheap. The Series 3 is still on sale from £199, but doesn’t do it for me with that mostly-off screen. With the competition mostly coming in at under £300 the Series 5 has Apple’s typical premium – but it’s a premium anyone considering an Apple Watch has already paid for their iPhone.Simply put, the Apple Watch Series 5 is the best smartwatch you can buy right now. You might just need to also buy an iPhone to get it.Pros: excellent haptics, always-on screen, ECG, great health tracking, great activity tracking, solid running watch, 50m water resistance, all-day battery life, offline music, loads of watch faces, quick-swap straps, comfortable, Apple PayCons: expensive, only works with an iPhone, no sleep tracking, too popular This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

He did not answer whether the company would take down outright lies if they were in political advertisements.This month, the company declined to take down a Trump campaign ad that included a misleading portrayal of the former vice-president Joe Biden’s work in Ukraine.“Do you see a potential problem here with a complete lack of factchecking on political advertisements?” Ocasio-Cortez asked.She also asked Zuckerberg about his “dinner parties with far-right figures” and if at those meetings he addressed the popular rightwing theory that Facebook cracks down on conservative speech, a question Zuckerberg also dodged.Zuckerberg’s testimony marked the first time he has appeared before Congress since April 2018, when he spoke at a hearing regarding Cambridge Analytica. The executive repeatedly acknowledged Facebook’s mistakes during the questioning on Wednesday.“I get that I’m not the ideal messenger for this right now. We’ve faced a lot of issues over the past few years and I’m sure there are a lot of people who wish it were anyone but Facebook that was helping to propose this,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0056c2faf6d5e76f92629adb7db9d0a03c5679fb/154_86_2084_1250/master/2084.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24d42a56b585b6e08c737cc1d8c4d71b","title":"which is best ipad air or ipad pro 11","story":"Len wants to replace a Samsung Tab S2. Should he buy the 11in iPad Pro or an iPad Air with extra storage?I use a 9.7in Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 tablet for general browsing, emails, reading digital magazines and some very basic photo editing. It only has 32GB of storage so some apps are installed on its 128GB SD card. However, the battery is no longer what it was, and Samsung has not updated its version of Android, so it is still running Android 7.I am thinking of getting a new iPad because Apple seems to support machines for longer, the apps seem better suited to my needs and, anecdotally, they appear to be more secure. On my budget, I can’t decide between an iPad Air with 256GB and an iPad Pro 11 with 64GB. Both will fit in my camera bag. Is it better to opt for a tablet with more built-in storage or one with a better processor? LenThe challenge for anyone designing a computing device – whether it’s a desktop, laptop, tablet or smartphone – is to create a machine that is properly balanced to meet its user’s needs at the price being charged. This is not an exact science. It depends on the cost of major components such as the processor and memory, screen, graphics, storage modules, operating system and so on. But you trust them not to saddle low-end devices with the cost of high-end processors, or to compromise high-end devices by providing too little memory andor storage space.This is the problem with both the iPad Pro 11 and 12.9, and why you are stuck with a choice you should not have to face.It’s not hard to read the trends in the technology market, and two obvious ones apply here.First, people need more storage to handle both apps and digital content that is now cheap or free, and, thanks to higher broadband speeds, easy to download. We’re no longer listening to 64kbps MP3 files or watching 640 x 480-pixel movies, and file sizes are much bigger than they used to be. So are web pages.Under the circumstances, 64GB is only fit for smartphones, Chromebooks and netbook-type Windows laptops. Shipping a high-end £769 tablet such as the iPad Pro with only 64GB is insane. It should have 128GB, which would be a rational fit with companion models that have 256GB (£919), 512GB (£1,119) and 1TB (£1,319). Then, each step up would double the storage.There’s another way to look at this. If you buy a 64GB iPad Pro 11 then you are paying £12 per gigabyte of storage. If you buy the 256GB version, the price drops to £3.59 per gigabyte, and at 1TB it’s only £1.29. Putting 128GB in the entry-level model – £6 per gigabyte – wouldn’t make it a bargain, but it would be in line with the rest of the range. And the extra cost of fitting 128GB would be peanuts at retail prices, without even considering the massive discounts Apple must get for buying them by the million.In short, I don’t think you, or anyone, should buy a 64GB iPad Pro. Either bust your budget and buy an iPad Pro 11 with 256GB of storage space, or get an Air with the same amount.Alternatively, wait for Apple to release new versions of the iPad Pro that start at 128GB. This could happen in November – the current models were released in November last year – or perhaps in March 2020, or later. Your Tab S2 isn’t dead yet …You’re already an experienced tablet user with 160GB of storage, so you should have a good idea how much space you will need. My own rule of thumb is to try to double everything with each new device, because you will always need more of everything in the future, and less-than-doubling rarely feels like a real advance.Unfortunately, tablets, smartphones and ultra-thin laptops don’t let you upgrade the processor. You’ll be stuck with it for the next five or more years. It’s a good idea to aim high.The Apple-approved method is to store as much as possible online in its iCloud rather than on the device, and to stream content such as music and movies rather than playing it locally. Streaming often depends on having a usable broadband or mobile connection, which can lead to buffering. It may also consume bandwidth and server resources, so it isn’t very green.In the case of cloud storage and streaming, remember that you can use any cloud – Dropbox, Microsoft’s OneDrive, Google One etc – not just iCloud. Also, you can stream music and movies wirelessly from a local PC or NAS server, if available.Perhaps you could manage with only 64GB of storage, if you put up with the extra cost of add-ons, and the extra inconvenience. It’s not too hard if you have a PC to do the heavy lifting. But if you are paying £769 and it’s your main device, as this seems to be, you shouldn’t have to.The 10.5in iPad Air (2019) is pretty much the same as the 10.5in iPad Pro (2017), only faster, so naturally the iPad Pro 11 (2018) has several advantages. These include the slightly larger screen, which is brighter (600 v 500 nits) and supports a 120Hz refresh rate, which Apple calls ProMotion. It also has an eight-core A12X Bionic chip, where the Air has the smaller six-core A12 version used in the iPhone XR and XS. Both include embedded M12 motion coprocessors, plus the eight-core “Neural Engine” that the entry-level iPad’s A10 Fusion chip lacks.The extra power of the A12X supports the doubling of the screen refresh rate from 60Hz to 120Hz, which should make a difference when playing games or using the Pencil, but it’s not a dealbreaker for most purposes. In fact, the two chips are so similar that pundits are expecting new versions of the iPad Pro with improved A13 processors, like those in the new iPhone 11.The question is whether you would derive any significant benefits from the iPad Pro 11’s better features. It seems to me that unless you plan to get into gaming or drawing, you’d be paying for things you don’t really need. You’d be better off spending your budget on accessories for the iPad Air. The options include a keyboard (£159), Apple Pencil (£89), and AppleCare (£69) from Apple, as well as all kinds of products from other suppliers.Have you got a question?

Nine teams over the course of three days hurl 500,000 pounds of oranges (from Sicily they aren’t grown in these parts) in their attempt to kill the tyrannical marquis, who apparently was decapitated by the local miller’s daughter the story dates from the middle ages. As a spectator you won’t be involved in the crossfire, but there is an incredible amount of oranges to contend with on the ground.

Up Helly Aa is a wild, torchlit party with costumed Norse revellers, all-night dancing and drinking, bonfires, processions and blazing ships which celebrate the island’s connections with Scandinavia. The main theme is who can be the Lord of Lerwick, apparently by being the last person standing as the festivities end. Many of the characters portrayed were real vikings with fascinating stories attached to them.

Over the course of one fortnight in November one of the biggest illuminated parades in the world travels around the county, warming chilly high streets with a procession of floats bearing thousands of lights, banging pop tunes, and sulky tweenagers dressed in masquerade costumes. The route takes in towns such as Bridgwater, Shepton Mallet and Weston-super-Mare, but my favourite venue is Glastonbury, if only for the conjunction of stoned hippies, drunk locals, and bemused-looking visitors. Bridgwater’s spectacular illuminated processions takes place on the first Saturday of November. • visitsomersetAlice RooneyThe Lemon festival is held at the end of winter in the south of France, in the small town of Menton (from 15 February to 3 March in 2020) to celebrate the Menton lemon. The theme changes each year, but the carnival always includes enormous sculptures made from oranges and lemons (entry costs €10). There are also multiple parades filled with citrus floats and dancers (tickets cost €25 seated, €12 standing). I found the whole experience to be unique.• fete-du-citronMilaLast November we visited the Tartófla truffle festival held in Savigno, a 45-minute drive south-west of Bologna. Aside from a brisk trade in whole white truffles and stalls selling truffle-flavoured everything, there were exhibitions, crafts and a huge pop-up restaurant tent serving a truffle-heavy menu. There was even a workshop where you could take your dog to test its truffling potential. Our highlight was the candlelit evening truffle hunting expedition (€10 adults) which took us through farmland with a truffle-hunter and his dog, finishing in woodland where the dog excitedly dug up a few truffles, though it ate half of them before we had a chance to catch a glimpse!

Stay at very reasonable prices in the villages or in comfortable country houses: a wonderfully authentic experience of popular culture.Annalee CurranDuring the Amsterdam Light Festival (28 November to 19 January 2020), the city is illuminated by light artists from all over the world showcasing their work throughout the city centre. Hundreds of designers and architects submit their ideas and the selection committee chooses 30 artworks. To fully enjoy the festival, as we did, it’s best to follow suggested routes on foot, and there are also routes for those who want to see it all by bicycle and boat.John KilkellyNext year’s Breakthrough of the Yellow Wine festival will take place on the weekend of 1-2 February in the picturesque village of Ruffey-sur-Seille, 80km south-west of Besançon. This local festival celebrates the release of the new vintage of this very special sherry-like wine which is aged for six years. A €20 day pass is available online (see below) which gives you 10 tasting tickets for the winemakers displaying their produce in their decorated cellars plus a souvenir glass. There’s also a cookery competition, a wine auction, parades of Jura winemakers and great street food.• percee-du-vin-jauneJanteeLooking for a holiday with a difference?

It wasn’t even her first viral moment that dayIt isn’t often that you hear someone rave about a great congressional hearing they’ve seen online. Heck, outside of big national events, I’m going to bet you have never willingly watched C-Span.But less than one year since she entered Congress, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has represented New York’s 14th congressional district since January, has changed that.AOC has shown a remarkable ability to extract energizing viral moments from stale bureaucratic meetings. She turns complex political concepts into snappy soundbites and boring old politics into much-talked-about spectacle.This is exactly what happened on Wednesday during her questioning of Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg about his early awareness of the disgraced political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which harvested millions of Facebook users’ personal information to influence the 2016 US election. The confrontation is uncomfortable to watch, with Ocasio-Cortez grilling Zuckerberg on key details about his knowledge back then – he denies having any – and then ending on the zinger:“You don’t know? This was the largest data scandal with respect to your company, that had catastrophic impacts on the 2016 election. You don’t know?”She is met with a squirming Zuckerberg and therein, a viral moment is made.This wasn’t her first time capturing people’s attention with her line of questioning. In fact, it wasn’t even her first time that day.Just hours before she made Zuckerberg eat his own words, AOC attended a hearing with the oil giant ExxonMobil.In the video, she shows Martin Hoffert, a consultant for the company, a graph he worked on from 1982 and asks him to describe it. Thus she gets him to explain how the company knew about climate change before she was even born – predicting its levels accurately until the present day.The stinger comes at the end, when Hoffert testifies: “We were excellent scientists,” and she adds: “Yes. You were: so they knew. ”During this hearing, Ocasio-Cortez exposes an American double standard: that white supremacist acts of violence are treated as hate crimes, while similar violence committed by Muslims is treated as terrorism.Her cunning ability to use the FBI’s own rhetoric against it is what makes it so watchable. She gets the bureau’s assistant director for counter-terrorism to describe terrorism in his own terms, and then repeatedly uses his own definitions as a stick to beat him with.Ocasio-Cortez achieves the seemingly impossible: turning a discussion about the intricacies of campaign finance into a clear and immensely watchable three-minute video. The clip, which was uploaded by the leftwing channel NowThis news, has been viewed more than 37m times, making it the most watched political video ever posted to Twitter.She starts out with the proposition “let’s play a game” – and off she goes.In this game, she is the self-interested bad guy, trying to make as much money as possible. She checks in every now and then with the panel of government watchdogs, to see how much she can get away with. The answer? Pretty much everything – playing into her point that of course the system is broken.After Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal failed to pass the Senate, she gave the GOP a supreme telling off by tearing down the presumption that only elites care about the environment. In the clip, she asks:“You want to tell people that their desire for clean air and water is elitist? … I don’t think so.”If she has already proven that she can act as a great game-show host and detective – here is proof that she excels in giving a lecture, too:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f895d5b0a04d4151ad3dc30b49a797e2eb3dee0/0_70_2106_1264/master/2106.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d9f96dc724c09354c7b9ea68dfebd72","title":"amazon best buy tvs chemicals europe","story":"Several TV lines on sale in the US contain flame retardants linked to potential health problems, tests by public health campaigners findPopular brands of televisions sold by Amazon and Best Buy in the US contain potentially hazardous flame retardants linked to health problems including cancers and learning difficulties, according to a new report.Six Toshiba and Insignia brand TVs, made in partnership with Amazon and Best Buy respectively, sampled by public health campaign groups contained organohalogens, which are flame retardant chemicals recently banned by the European commission over safety concerns.Organohalogens are considered toxic and have been linked to certain cancers, harm to the nervous system and learning difficulties. The European ban, which encompasses other display-based appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines – will come into force in 2021.There is no such wide ban in the US, although deca-BDE, a type of organohalogen flame retardant, is banned in five states. The TVs tested by a coalition of public health advocates found that the Insignia TVs contained deca-BDE.Mike Schade, Mind the Store campaign director of Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families, said it was “critical that large companies step up and safeguard their customers. If government won’t act, it’s up to the business community to mind the store.“Why are Best Buy and Amazon allowing these dangerous, old-school flame retardants to be used in televisions that are supposed to be top-of-the-line? Safer alternatives exist, so organohalogen flame retardants have no place in our homes in 2019.”In a statement, Best Buy defended its “long track record as a steward of the environment” and said it “fully supported the responsible use of chemicals above what is legally required”. It said the units in this report included recycled materials which it said regulators recognize as “important” and “allow for trace amounts of some chemicals in electronics housings”. It added that the units tested were not from its newer lines.Chemicals from the casings of TVs can leak into the air or into dust that accumulates around the home, causing a gradual buildup in people’s bodies. While it is difficult to blame the flame retardants on any specific case of illness, campaigners say that enough concern has been raised in studies over potential links that a ban is justified.The sampling of the TVs – on behalf of a coalition of campaign groups including Toxic Free Future, Mind the Store and Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families – involved removing small pieces of the plastic casings and sending them to a lab in the Netherlands for testing. The Insignia TVs were purchased from a Best Buy in the Seattle area, while the Amazon sets were bought online.The testing found that all six TVs contained organohalogens as their primary flame retardants, with all three Insignia TVs containing the deca-BDE chemical.In 2017, the US Consumer Product Safety Commissioned urged electronics manufactures to reduce use of organohalogens in plastic casings, as well as in other products such as furniture and mattresses.A spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said the agency proposed a rule in June that would ban the manufacture and distribution of deca-BDE and products that contain it, including TVs, bar a few exceptions. Campaigners say that the agency should hurry up and implement a full ban.“I don’t anticipate any quick move to address the problem of toxic chemicals – it’s mainly been left down to the states to act,” said Erika Schreder, science director with Toxic Free Future. “As a consumer there’s no way to choose a TV that is safer. People are being put at unnecessary risk given that there are safer alternatives available.”Amazon did not respond to a request to comment.Best Buy said it had “a restricted substances list that our suppliers must adhere to”. It added: “For organizations to assert otherwise is both inaccurate and irresponsible.“Regulatory bodies recognize the importance of recycling and allow for trace amounts of some chemicals in electronics housings made from recycled material. The units in this report – which haven’t been part of our new product assortment for some time – do include recycled material.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/717068f4c10761bd5d4881902ee7b28977b75044/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b402941b47093ba999da5773ee6625e5","title":"us elections 2020 richest zip codes fundraising","story":" fundraising analysis reveals wealthy areas’ fondness for moderate DemocratsThe town of Atherton, California has only 7,000 residents, but it’s home to enough titans of the tech industry to field a polo team: Sheryl Sandberg, Eric Schmidt, Meg Whitman, Tim Draper and Marc Andreessen are just some of the Silicon Valley suburb’s rich and famous. When the former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg decamped from British public life to Facebook public relations, he traded a townhouse in Putney for a $9m estate in the exclusive enclave.Americans who live in the country’s 20 wealthiest zip codes have donated the most to the moderate Democratic presidential candidates Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Booker and Joe Biden, a  analysis of presidential campaign finance filings for the first nine months of 2019 found. The vast majority of the fundraising from the 20 wealthy areas went to Democrats. Residents of these bastions of actual limousine liberals – including Westchester, New York, Beverly Hills, and Greenwich, Connecticut – have ponied up nearly $880,000 for Senator Harris and nearly $600,000 for Mayor Buttigieg. Booker and the former vice-president Biden raised more than half a million dollars each.Donald Trump cashed his share of checks, too. The president raised more than $500,000 in total across the 20 locales, and was the top recipient in three: Palm Beach, Florida Newport Beach, California and Bedminster, New Jersey. Trump spends significant time at his private club Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach and his golf club in Bedminster.Meanwhile, the senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who are among the frontrunners nationally, have amassed the largest campaign war chests of all the Democratic candidates while refusing to hold high-dollar fundraisers and calling for higher taxes on the wealthy. Their aversion to the rich appears to be reciprocal.Sanders, who has raised the most of all Democratic candidates this cycle, has received just $59,130.05 from donors in these areas. Warren brought in slightly more than $160,000.The ’s analysis does not include every donor because campaigns are not required to report contributions from those who gave less than $200 in total. We used data from the Internal Revenue Service to identify those zip codes with at least 1,000 tax-filing households and the highest average adjusted gross income.Booker’s haul in Atherton – $95,650 – tops Sanders’ total across all 20 zip codes. The former mayor of Newark also topped the list just north of San Francisco in Marin, and in a number of wealthy suburbs of New York City – Westchester, New York Short Hills, New Jersey and Old Westbury, New York.Harris was a close second in Atherton, and the California senator also came out first in other elite neighborhoods in her home state: Palo Alto downtown San Francisco Century City, Los Angeles and Beverly Hills. She also topped the list for Tribeca in New York City.Though Buttigieg brought in the second-highest amount of total fundraising from the 20 wealthiest zip codes, he only topped the list in Greenwich, Connecticut – a bastion of New England blue blood and the childhood home of George HW Bush.Of course, political donors in these zip codes only represent a tiny fraction of the American public – and account for less than $4m of the hundreds of millions of dollars that have already been donated to 2020 presidential candidates.We did the same analysis of the poorest 20 zip codes with at least 1,000 tax filers – a list that includes poor neighborhoods in cities such as St Louis, Missouri Erie, Pennsylvania Tallahassee, Florida and Cincinnati, Ohio. Across all 20 areas, campaigns have reported just 28 donors, for a total of $7,113.31.Sanders was the clear favorite, bringing in nearly $3,200 from 12 donors, followed by Trump ($965) and Andrew Yang ($894).We also looked at political fundraising by residents of major metropolitan areas – where the majority of Americans live.These results demonstrate a distinct home-field advantage. Harris, of California, wins out in San Francisco and Los Angeles, while Warren, of Massachusetts, takes the prize in Boston and New Jersey. New Jersey’s Booker tops the list in neighboring New York City. Buttigieg, a midwestern mayor, performed best in Chicago.Trump swept a number of major cities across the southern half of the US, racking up the most money in Miami, Atlanta, Dallas, Houston and Phoenix, Arizona. Beto O’Rourke was the top Democratic fundraiser in both Dallas and Houston, while Biden led Democrats in Atlanta and Miami and Sanders won the most Democratic support in Phoenix."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/077b74d23f38a5765e898a2934f1004d635b0871/0_55_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f615a8369b1755dfb46a794cf1b92e0","title":"zero support the democratic presidential candidate who refuses to give up","story":"A two-term congressman’s campaign demonstrates the difficulty hopefuls have in breaking through the crowded fieldJoe Sestak, three-star admiral, two-term congressman, and Democratic presidential candidate, strode into his campaign event in New Hampshire last Tuesday to something of an anticlimax.There was only one person there.“Hello,” Sestak said, shaking the hand of the lone attendee: a woman named Kath Allen. The rally had been billed as a discussion of government’s role in society, and was held in the downstairs room of a public library in Peterborough, south-east New Hampshire.It was an inauspicious start to the two days the  spent with Sestak, 67, who is spending three weeks campaigning in New Hampshire – including walking 105 miles (169km) across the state – as he seeks to build momentum for his little-known campaign to take on Donald Trump in the race for the White House in 2020.But it was also an insight into the difficulty that even seemingly well-qualified candidates have in breaking through the noise of a densely populated Democratic field, and the money and effort spent on campaigning that runs under the radar.Sestak, 67, spent four years in the House of Representatives, representing a traditionally Republican Pennsylvania district, until 2010. He announced his run for the presidency on 23 June. Before this New Hampshire sojourn, he had spent three months in Iowa, holding 235 events, driving 17,000 miles (27,000km) and, according to his campaign, “shaking nearly 30,000 hands”. He started his ramble across New Hampshire on 13 October, and is planning to cover 105 miles (169km) in eight days.On the same day, Sestak met Allen in Peterborough, the 12 leading Democratic candidates were debating in Ohio on CNN. The audience was 8.3 million: disappointing for CNN, but priceless exposure to someone like Sestak.Yet, to his credit, Sestak persevered with his one-person crowd in Peterborough. He’d walked there, after all – seven miles, from Dublin. Sestak’s staff will pick him up and drive him to some of his farther-flung New Hampshire events, but he plonks a stick in the ground at the end of each walk, and starts there again the next day.That same persistence was eventually rewarded at his Peterborough event, when, after speaking to Kath Allen and three journalists for half an hour, a second person showed up. And after listening to Sestak, Allen was impressed.He had answered her questions about senior care, and healthcare – he prefers the centrist Medicare-for-all-who-want-it-style plan, rather than the more progressive, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders proposal of Medicare for All. He had confidently fielded queries from the latecomer, about nuclear power. (He is in favor, but wants to use thorium reactors, not uranium.) But Allen wasn’t planning to vote for him, and she was skeptical about whether he will be the Democratic nominee.“I don’t think he can get it,” Allen said. “People want the flamboyant. And he’s not well-known.”“I like other candidates, I like Tulsi, I like Joe. I really like what Joe has to say on most of the things,” Allen said. “But I don’t know. I’m gonna see how this plays out.”By the time Sestak entered the race, most of the other candidates had been running for months. (John Delaney, a businessman and three-term congressman, had been running for almost two years.)Sestak announced his candidacy late because he was caring for his daughter, who had been diagnosed with cancer for a second time. Happily, she is now in recovery, but his late entry means other candidates have pulled ahead. It goes without saying that his rivals have drawn larger crowds. Some 15,000 people attended an Elizabeth Warren rally in Seattle in August, and her campaign said 20,000 came out to an event in New York City in September.As the 12 leading candidates prepped to go onstage, Sestak attended his third event of the day: a local Democratic party meeting in Goffstown, 40 minutes north-east of Peterborough.It was 6.30pm before Sestak arrived and started speaking – 10 people had shown up – and he had another event in Windham, 35 minutes away, at 7.30pm. He promised to keep it short, and started with a joke.“I’m actually in the debate tonight,” Sestak told the crowd.“Online,” Sestak said. “We’re doing a live stream, in a Dunkin’ Donuts.”Sestak had used the same gag at the Peterborough library, where Allen had been halfway out of her chair going for a high five before he dropped the punchline.As promised, that night Sestak held his own online debate. He answered the same questions posed to the candidates on stage, live from a Dunkin’. Sestak was sitting quite far away from the camera and it was difficult to hear him. At 9.57pm, just three people were watching the live stream on Sestak’s Facebook page, and the  was one of them.Part of Sestak’s problem may be that he is a centrist, white, older man, in a field with plenty of centrist, white, older men. Sestak’s USP, though, is his foreign policy experience and, given the chance, he ties it well to other aspects of the presidency.“We need someone who can unite this country and convene the world,” Sestak says, promising to bring the country together in the wake of Donald Trump’s presidency. met Sestak again the day after the debate, in Peterborough, where he had planted his stick on Tuesday. He had 18 miles (29km) to walk on Wednesday, and he expected to be on the road until 11pm. We set off walking east, uphill, at a fast pace, Sestak wearing black hiking boots. He walked across Pennsylvania in 2015, when he campaigned for the Senate – he lost in the primary – and believes the benefits outweigh any potential pain.“It seems to be catching a little bit,” he said of his campaign. As well as walking and meeting people, Sestak is running a TV ad campaign in New Hampshire.“We see people who are seeing our ads. It’s coming to a point of once you know I’m out here serving, trying to serve you, and they’re interested.”Sestak doesn’t regret entering the race late. But he agrees he missed out on early exposure.“Would my position have been enhanced if I had got in earlier? With the town halls happening, I think it would be a bit easier,” Sestak said. With his lower profile, his campaign has been told by some of the main networks that they won’t book him for interviews – even on foreign policy, despite his experience.That fundraising total, combined with his polling, means he is highly unlikely to meet the threshold for the next televised Democratic debate in November. But, marching uphill in New Hampshire, Sestak told the  he had no plans to drop out.“I wouldn’t go through this if I didn’t think we have a possibility of winning,” he said.He had an additional 16 miles (26km) to go that day – a long way, but nothing compared with the distance he has to make up if he is to be the Democrat’s choice in the race for the White House."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56f24239edbbca9b530cff350b0b1030aad53690/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9c4d7fa2959bdd97831aef157e02033","title":"christina de fernandez kirchner argentina marci","story":"She was vilified when she left office in 2015 – but polls say the former president and Alberto Fernández are likely to oust Mauricio MacriWhen she left office in 2015, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner was vilified by her opponents as a corrupt populist who had bankrupted Argentina during her two-term presidency.She was painted as a sore loser, who even refused to participate in the ceremony in which tradition demanded she present her successor Mauricio Macri with the presidential baton and sash.“I was Cristina, the arrogant ‘bitch’, the authoritarian populist,” wrote the former president – commonly referred to as Cristina Kirchner in Argentina – in a memoir earlier this year.Meanwhile, she was entangled in a string of court cases involving accusations of bribery, money laundering, corruption and allegations that she had helped cover up Iran’s involvement in a terrorist bombing that prosecutor was investigating.But in what could be one of the most incredible comebacks in Argentina’s political history, Fernández de Kirchner seems to be on the brink of returning to office as vice-president – and potentially the real power behind the throne.Polls before Sunday’s election predict that the former president and her running mate, Alberto Fernández (no relation), could win by as much as 19 percentage points.They are facing incumbent Macri, who took power in 2015 pledging “zero poverty” and denouncing the allegedly rampant corruption during the 12-year rule of Fernández de Kirchner and her late husband and presidential predecessor, Néstor Kirchner.But so dismal was Macri’s economic mismanagement that voters appear willing to turn a blind eye to Fernández de Kirchner’s many court appearances, the arrest of her former cabinet members, and even the discovery of $4.6m in cash in a safety deposit box belonging to her 29-year-old daughter. (No verdict has been reached in any the court cases she is involved in, and as a sitting senator, Fernández de Kirchner remains immune to prosecution.)Macri also seems to have underestimated Fernández de Kirchner’s deep hold on the political imagination of many Argentinians. She dominates social media and seems to represent a modern-day version of Eva Perón, Argentina’s unofficial patron saint of the poor, the charismatic wife of President Juan Perón.Like Evita, Fernández de Kirchner has earned first-name recognition in Argentina she also championed the poor with social aid programs while remaining a self-confessed slave to fashion.The former president is a talented public speaker who made weekly national addresses in office. Macri, meanwhile, is an often graceless speaker, whose wooden delivery did not help when announcing unpopular government measures such as massive tariff hikes.He has also earned the dislike of many female voters for his reflexive sexism, and his support for Argentina’s anti-abortion movement, which prevented the passage of a law legalising abortion during his presidency.“Cristina represents an empowered woman,” said Samanta Casareto, professor of history at Buenos Aires University. “For a whole generation she signifies the vindication of social rights that had been deliberately set aside.”In a radio interview last week, Macri said Fernández de Kirchner’s economic policies were like “handing over the administration of the house to your wife, and your wife, instead of paying the bills, uses the credit card, and uses it and uses it, until one day they come to mortgage your house”.Such comment encapsulate the mindset of a “machirulo” – a recent coinage by Argentina’s feminists for a sexist bigot who disrespects women.After the disastrous radio interview, Fernández de Kirchner responded rapidly with a tweet: “See?!! I told you he was a machirulo.”Fernández de Kirchner also displayed superior political acumen when she chose not to run for president, instead handing the nomination to the moderate Fernández, a mild-mannered, moderate Peronist who served as cabinet chief in Néstor Kirchner’s administration.The surprise move effectively disarmed Macri’s strategy to portray the election as a choice between a safe pair of hands (himself) and a power-hungry, polarizing woman who was relishing the prospect of a return to the highest office in the land.Although Fernández de Kirchner is likely to call the shots, analysts say that the promise that her fiery spirit will be tempered by Fernández’s even keel seems to have appealed to middle-class voters disenchanted with Macri.Fernández has assured voters he would steer an even course in economics, seeking a friendly agreement with the IMF and avoiding the return of the kind of currency controls imposed during Fernández de Kirchner’s government.His promise is meant to assuage the doubts of middle-class voters in a country where banks offer dollar accounts to protect savings from Argentina’s perennial inflation.Brazil’s rightwing president, Jair Bolsonaro, has described Fernández de Kirchner, and her running mate as “leftwing bandits” and warned that her likely return to office means “Argentina is starting to head in the direction of Venezuela.”But the election comes at a time of political turmoil across Latin America – much of it fueled by popular rage at austerity measures and income inequality.Ecuador saw two weeks of violence over the cancellation of fuel subsidies. Across Argentina’s northern border, the Bolivian Evo Morales’s controversial bid for a fourth term as president has prompted allegations of voter fraud, while to the west, Macri’s close ally, Chile’s President Sebastián Piñera, has been accused of violently suppressing protests over poverty and inequality.In a radio interview on Wednesday, Fernández de Kirchner’s running mate accused Macri of downplaying the deaths and violence in Chile. “People reacted because it’s the most unequal country in Latin America. And inequality is like sitting on a bucket of petrol, if a spark falls, you blow up.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/779f820d6c2e1915c6cd2798ff6b6268069169fd/0_157_3200_1919/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=793307bbecf4a1fda9921978a1516853","title":"five conflict photographers on some of the hardest images theyve taken","story":"The new book Conversations on Conflict Photography delves into the stories behind some of the most critical images photographers have had to takeby Lauren Walsh, compiled by  Jehan Jillani in New YorkIn the newly published Conversations on Conflict Photography, Lauren Walsh, a professor at New York University and the New School, discusses the visual documentation of suffering with award-winning photographers, photo editors and representatives of major humanitarian organizations.The excerpts below delve into the stories behind some of the most critical images these photographers have had to take during the course of their profession.Shahidul Alam is a Bangladeshi photographer and the founder of Drik Picture Library, a Bangladesh-based photo agency. Alam has documented a wide range of events, including the movement for democracy in Bangladesh, natural disasters, human rights and social issues like class inequality and murders by the “death squads” in Bangladesh. As a result of his work, Alam has received death threats, and in 2018, he was arrested after publicly criticizing the government’s violent response to student protests.Her entire family had died, her home was gone, and there she was. Of course, I was very concerned about her.What happened afterwards, for me, is more relevant to the picture than the picture itself. Pretty soon after I took that photo, the girl found a home. There was another family, just as destitute, who took her on as their child. And that is really what the story is about. Horrendous things will happen to people it’s what happens afterwards that teaches you about a people and a place. To me, it’s remarkable that the poorest people I’ve ever come across are also the most generous. That overwhelms me.Susan Meiselas, an American photographer who has documented conflict and human rights issues, has been active in the field of photography for four decades. Some of her photos from the insurrection in Nicaragua in the late 1970s are widely considered iconic, and her subsequent documentation of the Salvadoran civil war, including the El Mozote massacre in the early 1980s, has received broad acclaim.“Context is so important. For example, for the image I took of the body on the hillside, I made a book to create a context for it. The photo had not been published in any news media. But it was an image central to understanding the violence happening at that time. The idea of someone being ‘disappeared’ – meaning executed and dumped on the side of a road – was not an American experience, and hence the vital need to present it in a fuller context. The level of repression in Nicaragua, when the photo was taken, had already unleashed a militant response and eventually the popular insurrection erupted. The intention of this image, especially its value then, was to help show a part of that story in a raw, evocative way. So I don’t think such graphic images should be considered gratuitous. And I do think they have to be contextualized.That photo, which was taken at Cuesta del Plomo, is from four decades ago, and if I were thinking about a more contemporary setting, let’s say witnessing one of the Isis beheadings, I’d ask, ‘What would I do now? Would I not make an image? If I make an image, what do I do with the image?’ Obviously, Isis has used images, which they make themselves, to shock us, and they have achieved that very effectively. But if you were the documentarian witness, right there on site, what would your responsibility be? And if you make the picture, what would you be trying to communicate? Are we implicated when it is a live execution? That is, is it inherently a performance for us? Alternatively, what would it mean to decide right then not to make it? Or to be forcefully prevented from making it? Or to never have the evidence that such things happened? I don’t know all the answers.And if you can only get access with the permission of Isis, what does that imply? When I was in Central America, the conditions were that you could be independent of any single force or faction, so you could move across borders and not be aligned, and that is rarely possible now.”Ron Haviv, an award-winning American photojournalist and Emmy-nominated film-maker, is a co-founder of the photo agency VII, which is dedicated to documenting conflict and increasing awareness of human rights issues around the world.“This appears to have been a room for executions. It’s in a hospital in Tripoli, and this image is a bit mysterious. So while I did speak about the universality of the ‘language’ of photography, there are also times when photographs can be enhanced with text. I don’t think there’s any way to know from this picture exactly what has happened. But what I hope comes across is that this is sinister something really bad happened here. You may not know immediately that somebody was executed, but you have a certain sensibility in response to this image.All this said, I try to balance between aesthetics and content. I don’t want content overshadowed by style. In other words, I don’t want my aesthetic to go past a point where you really don’t understand what’s going on. For example, I won’t give you a picture of a bird flying over a massacre that’s just a beautiful picture of a bird. That achieves something, but it’s not what I’m trying to achieve with my work. So I’m endeavoring to find that balance: there’ll be a picture of a bird flying over a massacre, but you’re still going to know the massacre happened right there.And then of course, the caption puts you over to the next level. So take the picture from the hospital – you know something really bad happened here. There’s what is presumably blood dripping down the wall, and there are holes in the wall. They look like bullet holes. The caption will then fill in the blanks: ‘Hospital workers clean up after numerous bodies were found abandoned in a hospital where executions appeared to take place.’”Eman Helal is an Egyptian photographer based in Cairo. She covered the 2011 Egyptian revolution and its aftermath, including a project on injured protesters as well as work on sectarian violence against Christians, especially after the 2013 military coup. She also focuses on social issues, such as the physical and sexual harassment of women in Egypt, and efforts to empower women there.“This is from the big Muslim Brotherhood camp at a mosque called Rabaa al-Adawiya. The day before this, police killed a huge number of people, trying to break up the camp. Some from the Muslim Brotherhood escaped with these bodies because they were afraid the police would take them. They brought the bodies to another nearby mosque. Hundreds of people died in this attack, and the people who managed this other mosque wrote down and posted the names of the dead. Everyone who had relatives in that camp went to this other mosque for information about their family members. They went to see if they could find the bodies of their relatives. This particular photo shows a woman crying by the body of her son.A young woman with the Muslim Brotherhood came over because she heard me screaming. I hugged her and told her, ‘My life is in your hands. Please don’t leave me.’ I told her that I came to tell the true story, not to put a spin on my coverage. She asked to see my photos, so I showed her – pictures of dead bodies, injured people. There was nothing that made the Muslim Brotherhood look bad. She tried to convince the other people of this, but they didn’t want to listen to her. After negotiations, they said I could take my camera with me if I left the memory card. So I had to leave without any pictures. That was really hard.The next day, I went to the mosque where the bodies had been moved. I was afraid that someone from the day before might remember me, so I worked quickly.”Alexander Joe worked for over three decades as a wire photographer.

Photograph: John GilesPA Wire Ireland exceeded its annual greenhouse gas emissions allocation by more than five million tonnes last year, with the latest figures showing the State is far off track in meeting commitments to decarbonise the economy. Ireland has pledged to reduce emissions to 20 per cent below 2005 levels by next year but the provisional 2018 figures from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) show it is set to exceed its target by 5 to 6 per cent.The State will face substantial recurring penalties from next year for non-compliance on emissions – likely to run to hundreds of millions of euro. Based on current trends, there is no indication when emissions will be reduced in key sectors as committed to, notably under the Paris Agreement. While Ireland’s overall emissions showed a marginal decrease of 0.2 per cent last year, this was due to significant reductions in energy and power generation that were offset by growth in emissions from households, transport and agriculture.“Ireland has exceeded its annual EU emissions budget for the third year in a row,” said Dr Eimear Cotter of the EPA. “At a time of global urgency to address climate change this is a national trend that we must reverse.” Home heatingHousehold emissions increased by 7.9 per cent, which was attributed to a cold winter last year, leading to increased demand for home heating. Oil remains the predominant heating fuel used in the State, which the EPA said “reflects the scale of the challenge to increase the resilience of our housing stock to extreme weather events, in terms of energy efficiency and use of renewable energy”. Transport emissions increased by 1.7 per cent, the fifth year out of the past six where emissions in the sector have risen. “Reversing this trend will require widespread transition to electric vehicles, increased use of public transport and reducing the number of car journeys,” the EPA said.Agriculture emissions increased by 1.9 per cent driven by higher dairy cow numbers (up 2.7 per cent), reflecting national policy to expand milk production. Dairy cow numbers have increased by 27 per cent in the past five years while greenhouse gas emissions increased by 8 per cent. “While agricultural production has gained some efficiency over this period, these gains will not be sufficient to deliver overall emission reductions,” the EPA said. “Full implementation of the measures outlined in the climate action plan are required.”Energy reductions were driven by a decrease in coal use (44 per cent), largely driven by maintenance works reducing the amount of energy generated at the Moneypoint plant in Co Clare, and increases in renewable energy volumes. Electricity generated from wind increased by 14 per cent and the proportion of electricity coming from renewables sources was 32.6 per cent. Policy shift“Ireland has drifted off target and we must implement a decisive policy shift each year, every year. The 2020 budget has been an important watershed,” Minister for Climate Action Richard Bruton said. “While the emissions have fallen for a second year in a row, the decrease is too small and driven by temporary occurrences. . . We have a brief opportunity to act and we must act now. The Government is determined to deliver.” Mr Bruton said the figures reinforced the importance of implementing the Government’s climate plan as it “sets out actions we need to take to ensure we meet our 2030 climate commitments, putting us on a trajectory to be net zero by 2050”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Supreme Court to hear appeal over housing rights of parents with access to their childrenInvestigation into voting row finds committee on procedures needs more powers\u0026lsquoUrgency and radical thinking\u0026rsquo required to end homelessness crisis, says charityHead of police service says loyalists could feel position in UK is under threatFarmers should be gauged on emissions produced rather than food, says Joe HealySome 600,000 people affected after mechanical breakdown in Leixlip plantFrench government says UK should examine deal \u0026lsquoas quickly as possible\u0026rsquoGovernment may challenge Data Protection Commissioner\u0026rsquos ruling restricting use of cardNational Treatment Purchase Fund pledges to cut waiting lists for common proceduresVivien Lusted: \u0026lsquoThere is no hospital . . . no medicine \u0026ndash where do you start?\u0026rsquoFigures show State is set to exceed emissions target by up to 6 per cent for 2018Siptu says planned strike this weekend will still go ahead\u0026lsquoPeople may never see orangutans but don\u0026rsquot want them to go extinct.That empathy isn\u0026rsquot there for insects\u0026rsquoPace of growth significantly outstrips number of Irish studentsAlthough primarily regarded mathematicianphysicist, George Gabriel Stokes\u0026rsquo pioneering biological experiments made a significant contribution to what became known as biophysicsDeveloping more specialised third-level courses increases pressure on senior cycle, says DesmondThere have been several cases of migrants found dead in heavy goods vehiclesCoveney appears to point to further intervention on devolved issues by UK parliament"},{"url":null,"title":"dublin boil water notice likely to be in place for number of days","story":"A boil water notice remains in place for some 600,000 people in the greater Dublin area on Thursday.The notice was put in place following a mechanical breakdown in the disinfectant processes at the Leixlip water treatment plant on Tuesday.Irish Water said the boil notice is likely to be in place for a number of days and that the utility will be continually testing the supply and liaising with the Health Service Executive. Once the HSE is satisfied with the water quality, the notice will be lifted.The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is due to audit the plant on Thursday afternoon. Problems were detected at around 11am on Tuesday. After hours of testing by the EPA and the HSE, a decision was eventually taken at 4.40pm to issue a boil water notice.The Leixlip plant supplies water to homes, schools and businesses across most of north Dublin city and the Fingal administrative area of north county Dublin, parts of southwest Dublin and parts of counties Meath and Kildare.“This morning, during a meeting with the HSE we reviewed the test results and the impact of the boil water notice. At the forefront of all discussions was the need to protect human health and that is why the boil water notice will stay in place for now,” Irish Water customer strategy manager Yvonne Harris said on Wednesday.Leixlip Treatment plantIrish Water said the initial problem that compromised the disinfectant process of water at the Leixlip Treatment plant on Tuesday has been repaired.However, the utility said untreated water probably remained in some 20 per cent of the network.The HSE said there was a danger that untreated water in the network may contain cysts of cryptosporidium and giardia. These may cause gastrointestinal infections with symptoms such as diarrhoea and stomach cramps. It advised people who develop such symptoms to consult their general practitioners for testing and treatment.Irish Water warned there may be “residual” untreated water in the network for several days, as treated water flushes the system.Cryptosporidiosis is a diarrhoeal disease caused by a microscopic parasite (Cryptosporidium). Once an animal or person is infected, the parasite lives in the intestine and passes in the stool.Giardiasis is a form of gastroenteritis, characterised by diarrhoeal illness that is caused by a microscopic parasite, Giardia lamblia.Irish Water said it was contacting all registered vulnerable customers who are affected by this boil-water notice to advise them.It has asked anyone with queries to contact Irish Water on its helpline (1850 278 278) or to check its website (water.ie) for updates."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4061312.1571906387!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"speed camera firm reaches deal on pay and rosters with staff","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSiptu said a planned 72-hour strike by speed camera van workers was still scheduled to go ahead this weekend. Photograph: iStockManagement at the company operating the State’s roadside speed camera system has said it has reached a proposed agreement with its internal staff representative body on pay and rosters .However the trade union Siptu said that a planned 72-hour strike by speed camera van workers was still scheduled to go ahead this weekend. The company operating the speed camera vans, GoSafe, said on Wednesday that the proposed new deal would cover the three-year period January 2020 to December 2022 and was subject to approval in separate ballots of the company’s 130 staff. The company said that pay improvements under the proposed agreement included increases in base rate pay with additional increases in bank holiday rates, employer PRSA contributions and holiday terms. Go Safe said staff had already backed the agreement on rosters in a ballot while a vote on the pay proposals would conclude at the beginning of November. The company also said it had improved arrangements for staff operating speed camera vans to take toilet breaks.However Siptu said the proposed agreement between Go Safe and the internal representative association had nothing to do with the union.Siptu said its planned work stoppage over working conditions and union recognition at the company would go ahead as scheduled this weekend.The company’s statement made no reference to the union recognition issue or the forthcoming planned strike. Siptu said it represented about 50 per cent of speed camera operators at the company.Last week Siptu announced that its members at GoSafe would take part in a 72-hour work stoppage from 9.00am on October 26th.Staff represented by Siptu are already refusing to operate the vans’ Telogis computer system which tracks and monitors their activity. This data is submitted to gardaí and forms part of their contractual obligation for payment, a Siptu representative said. Siptu organiser Brendan Carr said last week: “Our members are only taking this action as a last resort because of the intransigence of management which has refused to address their concerns relating to health and safety and their conditions of employment.” “These workers have attempted to address these problems through the State industrial relations mechanisms. The Labour Court has issued a recommendation saying that GoSafe should recognise Siptu as the representative of its employees who are union members, but this has been completely ignored by management.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4057998.1571674594!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the irish times most nominated in newsbrands shortlist 2019","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRosita Boland with her trophy at the 2018 Newsbrands Ireland journalism awards Photograph: Simon CarswellThe  has received 32 nominations in the shortlist for the NewsBrands Journalism Awards 2019 – the highest number for a publication in this year’s competition.The NewsBrands Journalism Awards are open to any work published in print, website, online, mobile, video, audio or any other news delivery format from any NewsBrands Ireland member title.Five of the six journalists shortlisted in the Foreign Coverage category write for The : Sally Hayden Derek Scally Suzanne Lynch Lara Marlowe and Patrick Freyne.The  received four of the six nominations for Best Use of Video, citing the work of Simon Carswell, Kathleen Harris, Enda O’Dowd and Bryan O’Brien.Jack Power of The  was nominated in three categories Business Story of the Year Investigative Journalism and Young Journalist of the Year.  reporter Sarah Burns was also shortlisted as Young Journalist of the Year as was current  reporter Shauna Bowers for her past work at The Times, Ireland edition.Markets Correspondent Joe Brennan is shortlisted for Business Journalist of the Year.In the Campaigning Journalism category, The ’ No Child campaign has been shortlisted.Fintan O’Toole and Hilary Fannin are both nominated in the Broadsheet Columnist category, while in the Critic of the Year category The  has four writers shortlisted: Catherine Cleary Patrick Freyne Niamh Donnelly and Fintan O’Toole.Three  writers are shortlisted in the Features Broadsheet Writer of the Year: Rosita Boland, Conor Gallagher and Conor Pope.Carl O’Brien is nominated, along with Power, in the Investigative Journalism category.

Photograph: Simon DawsonBloombergObjections by French president Emmanuel Macron have delayed efforts by Donald Tusk, who heads the European Council of European Union leaders, to secure agreement on a three-month Brexit extension for the UK.Mr Tusk spoke to EU leaders in recent days – including Taoiseach Leo Varadkar yesterday – in an effort to secure unanimous agreement to grant the UK an extension until January 31st.However, sources in Brussels and Dublin say Mr Macron is unwilling to wave through the extension.EU ambassadors met last night in Brussels but did not agree to the UK’s request. It is believed that the French government does not favour a three-month extension unless the UK commits to an election or a second referendum. However, it would be willing to agree a short extension of a few weeks to enable the British parliament to complete ratification of the treaty.StatementIn a statement to The , the Elysée Palace said the British parliament “should examine the withdrawal agreement as quickly as possible”.“We will see at the end of the week if a purely technical extension of a few days is necessary, to complete this parliamentary procedure,” it said. “Apart from these circumstances, an extension that is intended to gain time or to rediscuss the accord is excluded. We concluded an agreement and now it must be carried out without delay.”Other EU states, including Ireland, are worried that a short extension could result in the UK crashing out without a deal. In the Dáil yesterday, Mr Varadkar said he favoured a long extension that would also allow the UK to leave as soon as the withdrawal agreement is ratified.If there is no agreement in the coming days among EU leaders, they are likely to be summoned to Brussels for an emergency summit next week. Mr Varadkar said yesterday that his “bags are . . . packed” for such a gathering.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Mr Dooley confirmed he had not taken any steps to correct the record.Returned to his officeMr Dooley confirmed to the inquiry that that he did not vote in any of the eight scheduled votes.“He indicated he had returned to his office to make a call. He stated that he should have gone back but that he left the complex. He could not say how long the call lasted, nor could he say at what time he left the complex.”Mr Collins told the investigation he was not asked to vote for Mr Dooley.“When asked what he believed Deputy Dooley meant by pointing, he said that he had no idea, that he was looking at Deputy Dooley’s face and not his hands. He further states that he did not see Deputy Dooley leave the chamber.”Mr Collins said there was “no particular reason” why he then sat in the wrong seat. He said he “assumed” Mr Dooley was in the chamber.SanctionsThe report found the Dáil committee on procedures and privileges (CPP) needs more powers to sanction politicians who vote for absent colleagues or colleagues who are away from their designated seat and should have a role in considering irregularities during votes.The report also recommends that voting should not start until all members are in their seats. If an error comes to light it must be notified to the Ceann Comhairle.Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghail told the Dáil that the report was “factual and evidence-based,” and though it didn’t make findings, the facts were “stark and unpalatable”.He said there would be statements on the issue in the Dáil later and said it was his “sincere wish that members read the report before they express their views”.A separate complaint about the issue has been made to the Dáil’s internal ethics committee by Fine Gael TD Noel Rock about Mr Dooley, Mr Collins, Fianna Fáil TD Lisa Chambers and Fianna Fáil TD Barry Cowen.This committee is scheduled to meet later today and has the power to recommend a motion to the Dáil on the matter. This could result in a potential expulsion of up to 30 days if the TDs are found to have breached ethics laws."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons october 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Brexit latest news: Boris Johnson set to push for Christmas election as Tory chairman warns \u0026#39I don\u0026#39t want to be the Grinch\u0026#39Brussels insists Boris Johnson names UK commissioner if Brexit delayedNorthern Ireland could choose to follow a different time zone from Great Britain, business minister saysComment: The EU wants to get this deal over the line.

Using information from the Independent Schools Council (ISC) as well as our own research and analysis, we have compiled a comprehensive database of private schools’ fees mapped against exam results.Find your schoolOur interactive tool allows you to search for every school in England  - where their GCSE results are publicly available - and see how they fare against others in terms of value for money. Hovering over a diamond on the graphic brings up the school’s name as well as its fees per term and the proportion of grades which were awarded As and A*, or grades 7 to 9, in GCSEs or iGCSEs in 2019.Independent schools value for money - GCSE day (behind subwall)How it worksToday we are publishing the data for GCSE results and next week we will do the same for A-level results.We have created one graphic for day schools and another for boarding schools which generally charge higher fees. Schools which have both day and boarding provision will appear in both graphics, with the appropriate level of fees reflected in each one.Independent schools value for money - GCSE boarding (behind subwall)What we foundParents are paying more than £27,000 a year to send children to a private school where just 12 per cent of their GCSE exams will be awarded top grades, according to our analysis.Bellersby College London, which charges £9,020 per term for day pupils, has emerged as one of the most expensive day schools in the country but where pupils achieve among the lowest proportions of As and A*s, or grades 7-9, in GCSEs compared with other fee-paying institutions.  Among the most costly boarding schools was DLD College in London, where fees are £17,666 a term but just 28.07 per cent of GCSEs are awarded top grades.The college was established in 1931 to provide tutoring for prospective applicants for Oxford and Cambridge universities, as well as those preparing for Colonial Service entrance exams.Search for the best independent schools for GCSE resultsSearch for the best independent schools for 2019 A-level resultsSearch for the best grammar schoolsMeanwhile, Badminton School was identified as one of the best value boarding schools as it had one of the highest proportion of top exam grades but among the lowest fees.At the all-girls school in Bristol, which charges £5,475 a term for day pupils and £10,765 for boarders, 77 per cent of pupils achieved A-A*s or 7-9s in their GCSEs this year.Rebecca Tear, the headteacher, said that her pupils do not just “jump through exam board hoops”, but get a “hands-on” approach to their education. “It’s all about community here,” Mrs Tear said.  “Within the community the girls know one another, the older and younger girls, they know the teachers, and you’ve got really strong relationships both in and out of the classroom.“I really strongly believe that to learn, you have to be a little bit uncomfortable, you have to go through your comfort zone and push yourself.  Here, because we’re all so familiar, they are prepared to take those risks, to ask their teachers and ask each other.”The school, which was founded in 1858, counts Indira Gandhi, the first female Prime Minister of India and the actress Rosamund Pike among its alumnae.Badminton School in Bristol counts the actress Rosamund Pike among its alumnaeWinchester College, Charterhouse and Wellington College were among the top five most expensive day schools.Winchester College, an all-boys school which charges £13,304 per term, had the best results out of the three with 87.3 per cent of GCSEs awarded top grades. Private schools have come under pressure in recent years for hiking fees. “The danger the sector is in is that it has lost the middle class,” said Martin Stephen, the former headmaster of St Paul’s Boys’ School.“Part of the reason is as simple as the fact that they have been able to put the fees up and not reduce the number of applicants.”At Winchester College,  87.3 per cent of GCSES were awarded AA* or 7-9 this yearBarnaby Lenon, the chair of the ISC and a former headmaster at Harrow School, agreed that the biggest threat for private schools is “if they don’t hold their fees down”.He said: “Although it is true that the average fee has risen faster than salaries  - which is not a good thing - nevertheless there are still a pretty large number of schools with fees around £14,000.“Secondly now many more women work so there is more money available to pay fees than in the old days when often mother did not work. Schools have greatly increased the number of bursaries which are available for families who can only afford half or three quarters of a fee.“I totally agree that independent schools have to watch out that they don’t price parents out of the market, they are very aware of that and have made a huge effort to hold fees down.”Mr Lenon said there had been a growing realisation among parents that the relationship between exam results and success in life is not as strong as people once thought. He explained that with half the population now going to university, the premium attached to it has been slightly reduced. And with the growing number of problems with pupil mental health, this is something parents care about more, he said. Let\u0027s face it if you ask parents what they want most for their children, the first thing they will say is not results. It\u0027s that they are happy, make good friends, are safe and secure.Barnaby Lenon is a former headmaster at Harrow SchoolBellersby College and DLD College both said that the majority of their pupils are from outside of the EU, and do not speak English as a first language.“Arrival at Bellerbys is often their first time away from home, meaning they have to make academic, cultural and language adjustments,” a spokesman for Bellersby College London said.“We specialise in caring for these young adults, tutoring them and preparing them for university entry and the future world of work. 399 of our 2019 graduates progressed to a top 50 UK university. We\u0027re extremely proud of every cohort.DLD College said they work with a number of students who have found education “challenging”, and success cannot be measured by looking grades alone.“Our students enjoy five-star, secure and safe boarding in the same building with a strong co-curricular programme to match, a spokesman said. “For these reasons, the cost of boarding in this part of London cannot be easily compared with the cost of a boarding school in other locations.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Students are being charged £150 per week to live in the pods whereas campus accommodation at the university ranges from £111 to £183 per week.UWE is the latest university to come under fire for providing unsuitable accommodation. Last month it emerged that Bristol University offered student accommodation across the border in Wales after it ran out of room.  The university wrote to over 100 prospective first year students to inform them that there is no space for them in university-owned accommodation in the city. Among the possible options suggested by Bristol’s accommodation office was the “Commute and Save” residence in Newport which is over 30 miles away from the campus.A spokesman for UWE said that they are planning to build new rooms for 2022 to meet increased demand for accommodation on campus. As an interim measure, they said that the 21 “studio pods” are part of a trial to “to see whether these might be suitable as a temporary solution”.“These pods have been used successfully elsewhere, including student accommodation at other universities, and provide students with the opportunity to live on campus,” the spokesman said. We have already received feedback that students would like more social space included within the accommodation, so as a result we are adding an additional area for the students to use.They said that any students who wish to move from Purbeck Court could have their name added to a waiting list for alternative on-campus accommodation when it becomes available.Brexit latest news: Boris Johnson set to push for Christmas election as Tory chairman warns \u0026#39I don\u0026#39t want to be the Grinch\u0026#39Brussels insists Boris Johnson names UK commissioner if Brexit delayedNorthern Ireland could choose to follow a different time zone from Great Britain, business minister saysComment: The EU wants to get this deal over the line.

it turns out not to be as straightforward as members might imagine - I want all of those facts and recommendations that can be put into place to ensure that all of our motorways are as safe as they possibly can be.I will get this done in a matter of weeks.Department for TransportBrussels insists Boris Johnson names UK commissioner if Brexit delayedNorthern Ireland could choose to follow a different time zone from Great Britain, business minister saysBrexit latest news: Boris Johnson set to push for Christmas election as Tory chairman warns \u0026#39I don\u0026#39t want to be the Grinch\u0026#39Comment: The EU wants to get this deal over the line.

Only British Gas would be larger.Any interested party can comment on the proposed transaction until 6 November, the CMA said on Thursday.Ovo, founded a decade ago, has consistently been rated the best energy supplier by comparison site uSwitch. It has sought to present itself as environmentally friendly and has invested in developing home battery technology to allow consumers to store energy generated from renewable sources.Energy firms face crackdown after string of suppliers go bustEnergy firms ordered to pay £15m green taxes or face losing licencesThe acquisition of SSE’s retail gas and electricity unit would follow another purchase by Ovo: last year it took over Spark Energy after the challenger supplier collapsed. That deal gave Ovo 290,000 new customers.Competition in the retail energy market has soared over the past decade, reaching a peak of 70 suppliers in mid-2018, up from only 12 at the end of 2009.However, a record number of companies went bust last year and more have failed this year. According to the latest figures from energy regulator Ofgem, by March the total number of gas and electricity suppliers declined to 60.The latest casualty is Toto Energy, which ceased trading on Wednesday. Ofgem said it will choose a new supplier to take on all of Toto’s 134,000 domestic customers. Until then, their energy supply will continue.Despite the greater competition – as well as the price cap for customers on prepayment meters introduced in April 2017 – more than one in 10 English households remain in fuel poverty, according to the latest government data, covering 2017.gas and electricity\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It delivered 97,000 cars to customers in the period to 30 September, comfortably surpassing the previous record of 95,356.Tesla now expects to launch the Model Y, an all-electric SUV, by the summer of 2020, months earlier than originally planned, and its new “gigafactory” in Shanghai has already started trial production. Manufacturing in China enables the carmaker to avoid import duties and offer lower prices in one of its most important markets.Following the news on Wednesday, Tesla’s shares jumped nearly 21 per cent after market close to levels last reached in February.“Tesla nails it at last,” said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets. The results stand in contrast to the repeated large losses the company has made since its inception. In the second quarter, Tesla reported a loss of $408m.Tesla’s cheapest electric car wins top prize at industry awardsPolice abandon chase after Tesla electric patrol car runs out of powerElon Musk says \u0027cyberpunk\u0027 Tesla pick-up truck coming in NovemberBut Mr Wilson added: “In one sense, we shouldn’t get too excited”, noting the much smaller profit of $143m in the latest quarter and lower revenues compared with a year ago.Tesla is pinning much of its hopes for sustained profitability on the Model Y. Chief executive Elon Musk said on Wednesday that the mid-size SUV could outsell the Model S, X and 3 combined.SUVs have become very popular in the US, Europe and Canada, but most models still run on petrol, leaving Tesla to cater to consumers looking for an all-electric alternative.Tesla’s earnings improved partly thanks to the recognition of deferred revenue from its “Smart Summon” feature, which allows drivers to call for their car to pick them up using a smartphone app.US federal safety regulators are examining the feature as videos have appeared online showing driverless Teslas running into obstacles or nearly hitting other cars.Mr Musk said on Wednesday that software updates over the coming weeks would improve Smart Summon.The company also stuck to its earlier forecast that it will deliver over 360,000 vehicles in the year as a whole.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It states that you are entitled to services to be carried out with reasonable skill and care.If they aren’t, you may claim a full refund for the time you were unable to use your phone as a result of the outage. When you break it down, it’s probably not huge amounts, unless you’re paying a crazy amount of money for your contract.The key thing to remember is that you’re also entitled to redress for any out-of-pocket expenses you incurred as a direct consequence of being unable to use any of your phone’s usual functionality.\u0026nbspFor example, if you had to use a payphone to make calls, the cost of those calls could be the subject of a refund. But it may also cover your costs if you incurred bank charges because you couldn’t transfer money.Keep a detailed note of what impact the loss of functionality had, including the times, actions and direct financial consequences and then once the system is working again calculate your losses.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.Everyday Life will be Coldplay’s first album since 2015’s A Head Full Of Dreams. It’ll be released on 22 November.Additional reporting by AgenciesThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Though quantum computing could bring profound new processing power to the world, it is also incredibly complicated both to understand and to test.The milestone is revealed in a new paper that has been long-rumoured but is now finally published in the prestigious journal\u0026nbspNature. And the world is finally scrutinising what exactly Google means by quantum supremacy, whether its claim stand up – and what happens now.Here is everything you need to know about the breakthrough.The phrase, first coined in 2012, refers to something very specific but a little complicated to define. It is the moment at which a quantum computer is able to do something that a classical computer could not.Reaching that point would be significant because it would seem to prove the promise that scientists have been making for decades: that an entirely new kind of computer could be created that would allow for wholly fresh – and vastly improved – ways of dealing with data. That, in turn, could revolutionise the world.Created with Sketch.Scientists claim to have achieved quantum supremacy Show all 17Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.\u0026nbspBut it is important to note that it is also only a milestone: the real journey is much longer, and there is an awful lot left to do. Scientists are excited about the possibility of achieving quantum supremacy because of what it means about the process of creating really useful quantum computers, not necessarily as an end in itself.The phrase is also disputed for many reasons. Researchers including John Preskill, who first coined the phrase, have noted that it can give unnecessary hype around our understanding of quantum computers, and that it has an unfortunate echo of white supremacy.What\u0027s more, the very importance of the test is disputed, too. That\u0027s in part because it is difficult\u0026nbspto say exactly when quantum supremacy has been reached, because researchers could discover that any given process was actually possible to complete on a classical computer all along.To understand how a quantum computer works, it\u0027s important first to understand how a traditional one works. Everything from the phone in your pocket to the computer in your desk – and all the other places that computers appear – do so using the paradigm of classic computing, which has stayed strong for years but which quantum computers could compete with, if not displace.In a traditional computer, everything in the memory is represented as a series of bits, which work as a binary system: they are either 1 or 0, on or off. Those bits can be assembled into the vast and complex information processing systems that we use every day, by stringing them together and analysing the data they together represent.A quantum computer works instead with qubits, not bits – they are no longer binary, but instead can be in a number of different states. By exploiting the unusual behaviour described in quantum mechanics, scientists are able to build quantum computers, which operate at that more complex and therefore more powerful level.Just as in a traditional computer, those qubits can be assembled into a system and used to carry out operations. In a quantum computer, that is made up of a series of quantum gates, which can in turn be assembled into a quantum circuit.That – or a vastly longer, almost impossibly more complex version of that –\u0026nbspis how we get to a quantum computer, which is able to exploit those various strange phenomena and use them to run operations.Theoretically, those quantum computers and their entirely new paradigm should allow scientists to conduct those operations more quickly and in new ways. It\u0027s that which leads us to quantum superiority – and to the variety of other possibilities that lie after it.Google\u0027s great achievement – and it is certainly not the only company to try – is to boil down that complexity into a functioning quantum computer. The successful chip wasn\u0027t the first of Google\u0027s experiments, and there are more likely to come or probably already being used already, but it is the one that will go down in history as perhaps achieving the first great landmark in quantum computing.The Sycamore chip is a 54-qubit processor. That is relatively limited, and is one of the many reasons that the discovery is not practically useful – researchers want a 100-qubit or even 200-qubit system before they are really able to put it to the test, and see whether the dreams of quantum computing are realised.But the big breakthrough is just how high-fidelity and fast the gates that make up the computer are. Scientists have lauded the precision with which the system works, and it is that which allowed Google to make its announcement.The actual process that it did to prove its quantum supremacy was relatively simple in output: it just gave out random numbers. But it was the workings behind it that were such a breakthrough, since it used an algorithm that would take 10,000 years to give a similar output on a classical computer, but only 200 seconds on Google\u0027s Sycamore.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

RBS said it remains on track to hit its full-year forecasts.\u0026nbspChief financial officer Katie Murray said: “These results demonstrate our solid underlying performance in a tough operating environment.“We have seen strong growth across the business, and our sustained high levels of capital and liquidity mean we are well-positioned to support our customers in these uncertain times.“Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They went on to find the places in the universe where these are found – with the exception of one.This is the final stage of a decades-long chase to pin down the origin of the elements, said\u0026nbspthe study\u0027s lead author Darach Watson from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.We know now that the processes that created the elements happened mostly in ordinary stars, in supernova explosions, or in the outer layers of old stars. But, until now, we did not know the location of the final, undiscovered process, known as rapid neutron capture, that created the heavier elements in the periodic table.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe eye of Hurricane Dorian as captured  by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague from onboard the International Space Station (ISS) on 3 September The River Nile and its delta captured at night from the ISS on 2 SeptemberThe galaxy Messier 81, located in the northern constellation of Ursa Major, as seen by Nasa\u0027s Spitzer Space TelescopeThe flight path Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft is seen in this long exposure photograph as it launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberDanielson Crater, an impact crater in the Arabia region of Mars, as captured by Nasa\u0027s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft A team rehearses landing and crew extraction from Boeing\u0027s CST-100 Starliner, which will be used to carry humans to the International Space Station at the White Sands Missile Range outside Las Cruces, New MexicoBound for the International Space Station, the Soyuz MS-15 spacecraft launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 25 SeptemberHurricane Dorian as seen from the ISS on 2 SeptemberA string of tropical cyclones streams across Earth\u0027s northern hemisphere in this picture taken from the ISS on 4 SeptemberThe city of New York as seen from the ISS on 11 SeptemberThe element that researchers saw being formed, strontium, is found naturally in the soil. It is probably best known\u0026nbspfor providing the salts that allow fireworks to include red colours.Nasa releases ‘peculiar’ recordings from surface of MarsThe story of watching the process began in 2017, when scientists spotted the first ever gravitational wave. When they did, telescopes around the world turned towards its source: named\u0026nbspGW170817, it was a neutron star merger deep in space.If heavier elements were created when neutron stars collided, scientists thought they would be able to see evidence of them in\u0026nbspkilonovae, which are left behind from those mergers.It was looking in data taken at that time that researchers spotted the elements that were left behind.By reanalysing the 2017 data from the merger, we have now identified the signature of one heavy element in this fireball, strontium, proving that the collision of neutron stars creates this element in the Universe, said Watson.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Only British Gas would be larger.Any interested party can comment on the proposed transaction until 6 November, the CMA said on Thursday.Ovo, founded a decade ago, has consistently been rated the best energy supplier by comparison site uSwitch. It has sought to present itself as environmentally friendly and has invested in developing home battery technology to allow consumers to store energy generated from renewable sources.Energy firms face crackdown after string of suppliers go bustEnergy firms ordered to pay £15m green taxes or face losing licencesThe acquisition of SSE’s retail gas and electricity unit would follow another purchase by Ovo: last year it took over Spark Energy after the challenger supplier collapsed. That deal gave Ovo 290,000 new customers.Competition in the retail energy market has soared over the past decade, reaching a peak of 70 suppliers in mid-2018, up from only 12 at the end of 2009.However, a record number of companies went bust last year and more have failed this year. According to the latest figures from energy regulator Ofgem, by March the total number of gas and electricity suppliers declined to 60.The latest casualty is Toto Energy, which ceased trading on Wednesday. Ofgem said it will choose a new supplier to take on all of Toto’s 134,000 domestic customers. Until then, their energy supply will continue.Despite the greater competition – as well as the price cap for customers on prepayment meters introduced in April 2017 – more than one in 10 English households remain in fuel poverty, according to the latest government data, covering 2017.gas and electricity\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It delivered 97,000 cars to customers in the period to 30 September, comfortably surpassing the previous record of 95,356.Tesla now expects to launch the Model Y, an all-electric SUV, by the summer of 2020, months earlier than originally planned, and its new “gigafactory” in Shanghai has already started trial production. Manufacturing in China enables the carmaker to avoid import duties and offer lower prices in one of its most important markets.Following the news on Wednesday, Tesla’s shares jumped nearly 21 per cent after market close to levels last reached in February.“Tesla nails it at last,” said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets. The results stand in contrast to the repeated large losses the company has made since its inception. In the second quarter, Tesla reported a loss of $408m.Tesla’s cheapest electric car wins top prize at industry awardsPolice abandon chase after Tesla electric patrol car runs out of powerElon Musk says \u0027cyberpunk\u0027 Tesla pick-up truck coming in NovemberBut Mr Wilson added: “In one sense, we shouldn’t get too excited”, noting the much smaller profit of $143m in the latest quarter and lower revenues compared with a year ago.Tesla is pinning much of its hopes for sustained profitability on the Model Y. Chief executive Elon Musk said on Wednesday that the mid-size SUV could outsell the Model S, X and 3 combined.SUVs have become very popular in the US, Europe and Canada, but most models still run on petrol, leaving Tesla to cater to consumers looking for an all-electric alternative.Tesla’s earnings improved partly thanks to the recognition of deferred revenue from its “Smart Summon” feature, which allows drivers to call for their car to pick them up using a smartphone app.US federal safety regulators are examining the feature as videos have appeared online showing driverless Teslas running into obstacles or nearly hitting other cars.Mr Musk said on Wednesday that software updates over the coming weeks would improve Smart Summon.The company also stuck to its earlier forecast that it will deliver over 360,000 vehicles in the year as a whole.Additional reporting by agenciesOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It states that you are entitled to services to be carried out with reasonable skill and care.If they aren’t, you may claim a full refund for the time you were unable to use your phone as a result of the outage. When you break it down, it’s probably not huge amounts, unless you’re paying a crazy amount of money for your contract.The key thing to remember is that you’re also entitled to redress for any out-of-pocket expenses you incurred as a direct consequence of being unable to use any of your phone’s usual functionality.\u0026nbspFor example, if you had to use a payphone to make calls, the cost of those calls could be the subject of a refund. But it may also cover your costs if you incurred bank charges because you couldn’t transfer money.Keep a detailed note of what impact the loss of functionality had, including the times, actions and direct financial consequences and then once the system is working again calculate your losses.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I did report it and made my feelings clear. There were rooms facing on to the pool so there was no respite for these poor animals.“We walked along one night just to see if we could hear them and were stunned when the security guard was going to let us in. He gestured that he would tap the water and they would come. Of course we declined and again left in tears for these poor animals.”Dolphins’ trauma after being hunted for marine parks revealedDolphinariums say they invest in conservation, but the amount spent is often less than 1 per cent of profit, and dolphins bred in captivity are never released into the wild, WAP claimed.Nick Stewart, of WAP, described the industry as “sinister”, saying: “Dolphins being used as live surfboards, facing large crowds of people day in, day out with loud music and cheering, and enduring a never-ending stream of tourists seeking that perfect selfie is not education, nor is it humane entertainment. \u0026nbsp“Whether bred in captivity or captured from the wild by being torn from their mother’s side, these sociable, intelligent animals are imprisoned for life and are reduced to begging clowns performing circus tricks.“We need to make this the last generation of dolphins in captivity.\u0026nbspThe greedy dolphinarium industry has spun a web of lies, portraying themselves as carers, not captors.”In the wild dolphins swim in at least 100sq km of ocean, but in tiny barren tanks they may self-mutilate from stress, Mr Stewart said. \u0026nbspWe need to make this the last generation of dolphins in captivityAn Expedia spokesperson said the company\u0026nbsphad\u0026nbsptaken steps to remove certain wildlife interactions from its sites both in reaction to “questionable and unsafe” practices but also to feedback from travellers.“And as this cannot be done alone, we continue to work with five global, industry-leading wildlife and animal protection groups to grow our wildlife tourism education portal,” the statement said. “We are grateful for the close coordination with these organisations and our goal for the wildlife tourism education portal is to help better inform travellers about animal welfare and wildlife tourism.“The portal includes information as to whether an activity involves animal interactions, with a direct link to learn more about wildlife tourism and animal welfare and broader education around animal welfare and links to participate in the conversation and take action if a traveller is interested.”The findings came on the day that WWF revealed the development of dams and illegal gold mining that uses mercury are threatening the survival of river dolphins in the Amazon.All samples taken from mammals with satellite tags had high levels of mercury, which pollutes waterways and threatens species, WWF said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

If confirmed by the European Parliament he would be in charge of the EU\u0027s single market.Atos, which holds billions in UK government contracts, has a controversial reputation in Britain.\u0026nbspThe firm became the subject of protests while it ran disability benefits assessments for the DWP: a contract it quit early in 2014 after more than 600,000 appeals were lodged against its decisions. Four in 10 of Atos assessors\u0027 original decision were overturned, costing taxpayers £60 million a year.Government to review £500m of deals with AtosIn 2013 the firm was criticised after it was found to pay no corporation in the preceding year, despite profiting from huge volumes of government contracts. In 2016 the government announced that it would review all Atos contract over £10 million after a scathing report from the public accounts committee that found the company did not show an “appropriate duty of care to the taxpayer” when doing work for the NHS.Mr Breton, 64, hails from the large centre-right European People\u0027s Party group rather than Mr Macron\u0027s own liberal one – a fact likely to increase his chances of getting past MEPs.One Elysee official said of the pick: “He’s man of action who knows industrial issues inside out and who, while knowing Brussels institutions, will not have a bureaucratic approach to European issues, which is important for the president.EbS)Mr Macron\u0027s previous pick was Sylvie Goulard. She was rejected overwhelmingly by MEPs after she failed to answer questions about alleged conflicts of interests, as well as the breadth of her portfolio, which also included defence, space, and industrial strategy on top of managing the internal market.\u0026nbspMr Breton is expected to have the same unchanged, broad portfolio – meaning his appointment is likely to be highly scrutinised by MEPs.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Protesters facing Lebanese army soldiers wave national flags in the area of Jal al-Dib in the northern outskirts of Beirut.

The predicament of the young prince, Segismundo, calls to mind the Chinese sage\u0027s story of the man who dreams he is a butterfly and wakes to wonder whether he is actually a butterfly dreaming he is a man. This youth is at the mercy of political fluctuation: he\u0027s been imprisoned in a dark tower from birth because of a horoscope that predicted he would usurp the throne. Then, when there are anxieties about the succession, his father has him drugged, brought to the Palace, and bafflingly treated like a prince. A poetic piece that tackles deep metaphysical, political matters in a dazzlingly theatrical way. PTA play of astonishing breakthroughs. There had been plenty of soliloquies in Elizabethan drama beforehand. But no-one had ever talked to an audience like Hamlet. He doesn\u0027t just let you into his confidence, he lets you into his consciousness the best portrayals make you feel that you are soul-to-soul with this figure. It\u0027s his capacity for searching introspection that gets in the way and disqualifies Hamlet as a revenge hero: he\u0027s rather wonderfully miscast. Hamlet is brilliantly self-reflexive, constantly probing its own theatricality. The conscience of Claudius is tested by a play-within-a play Hamlet tries to fool the court by assuming an “antic disposition” that may at times waver into authentic madness. The piece is like a painful meditation on the contradicting meanings of the verb to “act” – to feign and to intervene. Inexhaustible. PTFeminism and expressionism collide in US playwright Sophie Treadwell\u0027s extraordinary vision of a mechanised, dehumanising metropolis. We feel the nerve-shredding racket of modern existence – described as “this purgatory of noise” – assaulting the Everywoman character at every stage as she makes her descent to doom. She\u0027s a stenographer, a sensitive cog in the machine who is blackmailed by her mother into marriage with a boss who revolts her, and ends up condemned to the electric chair for murdering him. Treadwell\u0027s nagging dialogue, with its jangly staccato and syncopated telegraphese, uncannily anticipates Harold Pinter and David Mamet. Her cry against institutionalised misogyny – “I will not submit” – resounds down the ages. PTIn Gogol\u0027s great phantasmagoric farce, an impecunious clerk newly arrived from St Petersburg is mistakenly assumed to be the eponymous inspector by the corrupt mayor and officials of this provincial town. Panic drives these paranoid locals to project a false identity onto this stranger. That would have been a good enough joke. Gogol, though, gives it an inspired, twist. His penniless nonenity turns out to be driven by an equivalent dread of being recognised as one of life\u0027s losers. So when he twigs to their exploitable mistake, he treats their absurd respect (not to mention their bribes) as long-overdue recognition of his true worth and becomes airborne with grandiosity. It\u0027s the interlocking lunacies that generate the comic delirium in this Russian masterpiece. PTOne of Pinter\u0027s most haunting and unnerving pieces. A married couple, Kate and Deeley, play games of power and possessiveness with the wife\u0027s former flatmate, Anna, who comes to visit for the first time in 20 years. The piece is horribly preoccupied with the use people make of selective – and conceivably invented – memories as weapon or way of gaining the upper hand. We mint memories, in this understanding of it, in response to the psychological needs of the moment: “There are things I remember which may never have happened, but as I recall them.” Deeley is threatened by Anna\u0027s youthful relationship to his wife and strongly attracted to the newcomer. There’s a wonderful evocation of rackety London when the girls lived as secretaries, but the uneasy comedy of all this turns lethal. PTThe best Jacobean tragedy outside Shakespeare, The Changeling also seems to anticipate film noir. The heroine hires a shady type to bump off her fiance. This villain has a facial disfigurement, but the piece is alert to how perversely attracted we are to what repels us. The assassin demands her virginity as his blood-money and the slide into shadowy corruption becomes inexorable. There is a subplot in a madhouse that is designed as a distorted mirror of the main action in its obsession with disguise, lunacy, and sex. PTThis Pulitzer-winning American playwright explores the history of her great-grandmother in early 20th century New York. Esther is a black seamstress – unmarried and illiterate – who sews ravishingly beautiful garments for other women to wear on their wedding nights. She gets what could be a last chance of happiness but it\u0027s destroyed in circumstances that are never sentimentalised. The sensual feel of fine fabric (her means of supporting and expressing herself) is conveyed with gorgeous descriptive power. Intimate Apparel manages to be uplifting without ever losing its irreverent humour. PTSophocles\u0027s play is still the most powerful ever written about the conflict between our obligations to the state and our duty to the ties of kinship. Antigone defies her uncle Kreon, the new ruler of Thebes, by burying her brother Polyneikes. He had brought an army against his native city and Kreon, in these politically volatile times, wants his corpse left for the dogs as an exemplary desecration. The philosopher Hegel saw this as the quintessence of true tragedy: not a conflict between good and evil, but between right and right. In fact, productions nowadays tend to come down in favour of Antigone and her self-sacrificing intransigence. PTRichard Bean had the inspired idea of transposing Goldoni\u0027s 18th century commedia dell\u0027arte romp from Venice to Brighton in 1963. Our jack-the-lad hero – frantically trying to hold down a pair of jobs, unbeknownst to either boss – is a failed skiffle player. The complications are deliciously warped. One character does a bunk to Brighton disguised as her psychotic twin brother who has been bumped off by her posh twit of a boyfriend in a gangland brawl. Still with me? The dialogue is naughty and knowing, but there\u0027s a terrific innocent joy to the physical clowning which peaks in the delirious sequence where our hero has to dish up lunch to the two masters at the same time. PTA supreme example of how a writer can make a play by putting together a triptych of miniatures. Holman was brought up in the pacifist tradition and Making Noise Quietly looks at the long-range effects of war in three chance encounters. In the first, set in a Kent field in 1943, a northern Quaker and an uninhibited London aesthete discuss their reasons for not fighting. In the second, a naval officer arrives to tell a mother of her son’s death in the Falklands War. The third is set in the Black Forest in 1986. An English private, gone AWOL with his disturbed eight-year-old stepson, come into testing collision with a rich German businesswoman who survived the Holocaust. There\u0027s a stunning scene in which she draws the little boy out of his dogmatic mutism by her repeated, stern insistence that he says “thank you” it\u0027s uplifing in the end but it\u0027s not pretty. Writing of rare sensitivity and cumulative power. PTThough he described it as “the lightest of light comedies”, Private Lives is the Noel Coward play that one would undoubtedly preserve for posterity. He wrote it as a vehicle for himself and Gertrude Lawrence, with indecent speed. The play centres on two orcees who, five years after their split, bump into each other on adjacent hotel balconies while on the first night of honeymoons with their new spouses. An elegantly contrived coincidence followed by a pattern of cheekily reversed expectations: most comedies end in marriage this one begins with nobbled nuptials as the couple unceremoniously ditch their second partners and abscond to Paris together. Elyot and Amanda are the kind of flighty egotistical couple that can neither live together nor apart. Anti-romantic comedy soaked in sex (and romance): “Don\u0027t quibble Sybil.” PT1240 Angels in America (1990-93), Tony KushnerSubtitled “A Gay Fantasia on National Themes”, Tony Kushner\u0027s astonishing two-part play is set in the AIDS crisis of the mid-1980s during the right wing administration of Ronald Reagan. The word AIDS was never mentioned by the President, and the struggle to find a cure was hampered by a lack of government recognition. Kushner retaliated by putting gay men centre stage in an epic that shows them fighting to forge their private and public destinies. This is, however, very far from a conventional “issue” play in its glorious ambition. The piece rages from Antarctica and the damaged ozone layer to a baroque heaven that god has abandoned. Prophetic angels crash through ceilings. There are “mutual dream” sequences where people wander in and out of each other\u0027 fantasies. The presiding demon of the piece is one of drama\u0027s greatest monsters: the incorrigible and shameless Roy Cohn was a real-life Republican fixer (and mentor to the young Donald Trump). PTA middle-aged woman is buried in a mound of earth first up to the waist then, after the interval, up to the neck. It is a sight that has never lost its capacity to startle. Beckett\u0027s Winnie prattles away dogged with optimism (“This will have been another happy day”) in a loquacious attempt to stave off hysteria and despair at her encroaching fate. Partly irritating, partly heroic, she brings forth a dotty lyrical monologue that\u0027s threaded with genteel half-remembered wisps from the “immortal” classics. Peter Hall, who directed Peggy Ashcroft in the part, rightly pointed out that “Beckett\u0027s theatre is as much about mime and physical precision as it is about words”. Except that his texts are great and this one is superb beyond belief. To quote Winnie: “What is that unforgettable line?” PT1440  Long Day’s Journey into Night (1940), Eugene O NeillWhen O\u0027Neill described Long Day\u0027s Journey as a “play of old sorrow, written in blood and tears”, he was barely exaggerating. This enormous autobiographical drama is so raw and unremitting in its revelations about his dysfunctional Irish-Catholic family that the author left instructions – mercifully disobeyed by his widow – that the play was not to be performed until 25 years after his death. You can understand the trepidation. Long Day\u0027s Journey plunges deep into the tortured heart of the Tyrones – James, the acclaimed actor who sold out to commercial success, his wife Mary who has recently relapsed into morphine addiction, and their two sons. When the play is under the baton of the right director, it\u0027s the like listening to the recapitulations in a great piece of music. You emerge drained but in a state of elating catharsis. PTHector wants to teach boys knowledge that will last them a lifetime. But the headmaster has become obsessed with government league tables and has hired Irwin to teach them glib, exam-passing techniques. That\u0027s the clash at the heart of Alan Bennett\u0027s hugely popular hit. It\u0027s set at a Yorkshire grammar amongst a group of clever sixth-formers. As with a lot of Bennett\u0027s work you can discern a revue-like structure in the play\u0027s glorious string of skits, gags, songs and sheer elating silliness. But it\u0027s also a brilliant portrait of a maverick teacher. The scene in which the doomed Hector analyses the Hardy poem “Drummer Hodge” with his pupil Posner is unsurpassed in drama as an example of humane teaching. Gay, unhappy Posner also has the play\u0027s best joke: “I\u0027m a Jew. I\u0027m small. I\u0027m homosexual. And I live in Sheffield. I\u0027m fucked.” PTFrank Hardy, an itinerant Irish faith healer, his wife, and his manager tell four monologues that contradict each other, leaving the audience to question truth and memory, lies and storytelling. Frank struggles to understand his own “gift”, and how his ability to cure comes and goes Faith Healer is also a parable about the artist and his inspiration. The play foundered when it opened on Broadway, but has since been recognised as a modern classic: in a good production, there’s a trembling sort of power to it. Friel’s writing can be rhythmical, incantatory, but it’s also gorgeously subtle. Although Friel throughout maintains a – crucial – ambivalence, the play attains a sort of transcendent grace of its own. HWPlays by this American writer tend to be long, slow – and strangely riveting. It’s hard to pin down what exactly makes John so bewitching. It is set in a kitschy, tat-filled Gettysburg guesthouse, where a fighting young couple interact with the dotty landlady and her blind but visionary friend. The house seems haunted: creepy dolls and pianos start playing themselves. But it’s also haunted by history (it was a civil war hospital), and by the older women’s memories of love, ghosts, and their own mystical experiences. All of this is a little spooky, but also rather emotionally stirring. Baker is also super sharp on the millennial couple’s dying relationship, which opens out into a look at how it’s often women who have to prop up men’s myths, to feed their needy hunger. HWFrom “I have always depended on the kindness of strangers” to “Stellaaaaaa”, Williams’s play has entered the popular consciousness. As well it might: there’s something eternal in its themes of loss, ageing, and the lies we live by. Fear and lust rub up against each other, sweatily few other writers have captured the heat of the South like Williams, and this is the playwright at his most atmospheric. Blanche DuBois – the deluded southern belle who shacks up with her sister and her macho, abusive husband – is a summit part for an actress, and everyone from Vivien Leigh to Tallulah Bankhead, Cate Blanchett to Gillian Anderson have had a go. HWThe only surviving full trilogy of Greek tragedies, through Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and The Eumenides Aeschylus traces the impact of violence and revenge down a Royal family, throwing questions of justice and duty into sharp relief. To win the Trojan war, Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter the trilogy opens with a play in which his wife Clytemnestra kills him to avenge her daughter’s death. In Libation Bearers, Clytemnestra’s son Orestes murders her in retaliation (if Antigone is a tragedy because it’s a conflict between right and right, this is perhaps a clash between wrong and wrong). The cycle is broken in Eumenides, where the gods form a court in which to try Orestes. It’s juicy, meaty, high-octane stuff – and has been given era-defining productions both in Peter Hall masked version at the National in 1981, and in Robert Icke’s crisp modern adaptation in 2015. HWPart of the playwright’s cycle exploring the African-American experience in 20th century American –  a play for each decade – this chapter is set in a Chicago recording studio in 1927. Ma Rainey, the “mother of the blues”, is slow to show up to record some tunes. Instead, we watch her band kill time and spar with one another. Although it all lands light as a butterfly, the script is stinging on subjects such as ambition and race relations. Ma Rainey, when she arrives, proves worth waiting for: an immense, haughty presence. There’s a twist towards the end, giving the play punch – plus the tunes are great, of course. HWIbsen wrote great women: we could have gone for Hedda Gabler. But A Doll’s House is one of those plays with a wide significance: written in 1879, it’s a proto-feminist text. When our troubled heroine Nora slams the door at the end of the play, it’s not just on her patronising husband, but on the whole of The Patriarchy. The play shocked some in its portrayal of a woman made so desperate by her suffocating domestic situation that she abandons her children as well as her husband, choosing freedom and self-actualistion over the prison of the home. Of course, things have changed for women since, but this exceptionally controlled play still unfolds perfectly – and that slam still resonates. HWYou could make a case for any of Chekhov’s plays really (we nearly went for his early, entertaining Platonov, just to be different) but the lucidity of The Seagull wins out. It’s got more plot, a sliver less ennui, than some of his others: a young man, Konstantin, longs to be a playwright his narcissistic mother Arkadina – an actress – is wrapped up in her new boyfriend, Trigorin, a successful novelist. He in turn romances Nina, Konstantin’s girlfriend and an aspiring actress. It’s not much of a spoiler to say none of their dreams exactly come true, life proving endlessly, exquisitely disappointing. The Seagull is a mordant comedy – scenes skewering both Arkadina’s monstrous ego and her son’s attempts at avant garde art are some of the best bits of theatre-about-theatre ever. But there’s also an unbearable tenderness to the play’s portrayal of young love, hope, and idealism. HW2340  Mother Courage and Her Children (1939), Bertolt Brecht Few, if any, playwrights of the 20th century had as much of an impact on theatre as Brecht: he wanted art to be a political tool rather than escapist entertainment, but also revolutionised theatrical form and style, doing away with naturalism. But it can mean his “epic theatre” is still associated with didacticism, rather than drama. Not so Mother Courage, though, which is epic in both senses: written after Hitler invaded Poland, but set during the Thirty-Years\u0027 War, it is a potent story of one mother’s attempts to profit from conflict, and the huge cost war always takes in the end. HWBased on the Greek myth where Medea kills her children in order to get revenge on her unfaithful husband, this tragedy has lost none of its force – or power to shock. But the text allows more sympathetic readings Medea too, as a woman fighting for justice in an unjust world. With a monumental lead part, and a chorus who react and comment on the action, the play has always been one of the most popular of the Greek tragedies. Taut and tense, you see the horror coming but feel desperately compelled to look. HWThe mother of a murdered child. Her imprisoned paedophile killer. A criminal psychologist attempting to understand what drove him to do it. Through first monologues, and then dialogue, this modem classic has much to say about the extremes of human anguish, but also our capacity for change, and for forgiveness. It’s a dark and thorny work, but a deeply humane one too, by a prolific British writer at her best. HW2640 The Importance of Being Earnest (1895), Oscar Wilde Has there every been such a reliably delightful comedy? The improbable plot of tangled engagements, lost handbags, invented wicked relatives, and real monstrous aunts runs like clockwork. There are innumerable blissful one-liners, the characters are delicious upper-class twits, and at every turn Wilde has a fine old time pricking societal niceties. It’s frothy fun, and funny froth, and always invites larger-than-life performances. Being so very bankable has led to Wilde’s play certainly being over-staged and it now feels thoroughly un-urgent – and then it makes you laugh all over again. HWSherman’s harrowing play pulls the rug from under you. You invest in the relationship between Max and Rudy, a decadent gay couple in Berlin in 1934 – but after the Night of the Long Knives they flee, before being caught and sent to Dachau. On the way, Max’s desire to survive produces sickening betrayal. He pretends to be Jewish rather than gay, but in the camp meets Horst, a man who reveals the honour in being true to one’s self. There’s an astonishing scene where – forbidden to touch – they have sex purely through words. Ian McKellen originally played Max, but Richard Gere and Alan Cummings have also taken on the role in what is now seen as seminal gay text – one that proves truth and love may flower in the most horrific, hopeless circumstances. HWAh, the transformative power of theatre… This familiar idea is irresistibly proven by Wertenbaker’s oft-revived play, based on a true story about a group of convicts in an Australian penal colony who put on a production of George Farquhar’s The Recruiting Officer. It has fun sending up the pretensions of theatre, but ultimately uses it as means for talking about empathy, communication, and understanding, as relations between the reviled prisoners and the cruel officers thaw. A direct piece of storytelling with a huge heart. HWLucy Prebble made her name with ENRON, charting the hubris of the financial giant, but while it may be less flashy, The Effect is still dazzlingly good. It has, at its heart, a question we’d all like to know the answer to: what is love? The play follows two volunteers in a clinical trial for a new anti-depressant when they fall for each other, they wonder whether their love is “real”, or a by-product. And given all interactions in the brain are just chemical, does it even matter? The idea of what’s really real and what’s really romantic, what happiness is and what function unhappiness might have, are turned over by Prebble’s own very sharp mind. Her characters are fun to spend time with, her dialogue is snappy, but she digs deep too, into both scientific theories and human emotions, taking us from the grey lows of depression to the technicolour highs of new love. HWIt can be hard to separate this play from an animating original performance by the great Mark Rylance, who played Johnny “Rooster” Byron – a wild misfit who lives in a caravan in the woods in rural England, gathering local young people to him like some kind of drink-and-drug-fuelled pied piper. Such a summary might sound tawdry, yet set on St George’s Day and ripe with Rooster’s storytelling, it has a mythic, mystical quality. A state-of-the-nation show powered by anti-establishment brio, it also precisely captures a contemporary rural community (very sweary, and very funny). Jerusalem became a ridiculously big hit, with audiences camping out round the theatre for tickets. But a recent revival suggests the play can still crow, whoever plays Rooster. HWWhat makes a great play? A lot of critics, academics, and playwrights themselves will point to form matching content. On this, Tim Crouch’s glitteringly clever play really delivers – while also being extremely moving. A stage hypnotist encounters the father of a girl he killed in a car accident. The father truly believes his daughter has been transformed into oak tree. At every performance, the father is played by an actor who’s never seen or read the play before they are given a script or fed lines by – yes – the hypnotist (played initially by Crouch himself, also acknowledging his “real” role as the playwright). The actor is transformed before us we accept that they are now the father. An Oak Tree has a radical honesty which has made it hugely influential among younger generation. We always know theatre isn’t “real” – by playfully acknowledging that, the emotional impact is actually heightened. It’s a magic trick where understanding the trickery only makes the magic more real. HWAthol Fugard came to see that the righteous anger of didactic anti-apartheid drama was not as effective as the subversive laughter of the black townships when it came to getting across the harshness of the conditions there. Certainly, there is nothing moralising or solemn about this piece which was developed by Fugard from improvisations with the great John Kani and Winston Ntosha who first performed it. A mischievous shaggy dog story, it pulls the audience into an atmosphere of good-humoured sociability. Sizwe is a work-seeker in Port Elizabeth who can\u0027t get a job because he doesn\u0027t have a permit. It turns out that he has found a dead man\u0027s pass book and has substituted his own photo, killing off Sizwe Bansi. A deceptively light and humane play that outlasts the apartheid era. PT3340 Purgatory in Ingolstadt (1924)  Pioneers in Ingolstadt (1928), Marieluise FleisserMarieluise Fleisser, the author of these sorely neglected plays, was the lover, protégée, and victim of Bertolt Brecht, and her subject was the lower Bavarian city of her birth. The plays use a bold collage technique instead of linear narrative, and she had penetrating insights into its vicious pack mentality and conformist claustrophobia. In Purgatory, she evokes a stifling Catholic ethos: we see two very different rebels (one girl seeks in vain for an abortion) who suffer the humiliation of having to crawl back to the pack. Brecht effectively hijacked her second play Pioneers (about the contact between the inhabitants and a visiting squad of bridge-builders). He imposed overt anti-militarism and sensationalising sex, and Fleisser was denounced as a traitor to German womanhood. Stephen Daldry and Annie Castledine directed a superb version of these plays at the tiny Gate Theatre in 1991. Since when, nothing. It\u0027s high time Fleisser was given her due. PTTempting as it is to include Michael Frayn’s sublimely funny backstage farce, Noises Off, the more serious Copenhagen just pips it. It imagines a real meeting between nuclear physicists, the Dane Niels Bohr and German Werner Heisenberg, in Copenhagen in 1941, to discuss developments that will lead to the atomic bomb. Then he reimagines the meeting, and reimagines it again – after all, no-one really knows what happened. Was Heisenberg warning his old friend of the Nazis’ advances in nuclear weapons? Hoping for a mutual pact to prevent the atomic bomb? Seeking absolution? Looking at the unreliability of memory, the structure of Frayn’s play is cleverly animated by the scientific ideas his characters discuss: Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is the basis for its dramatic form. A big hit when it opened at the National, it went to the West End, Broadway – and wound up on TV, starring Daniel Craig. HWThis play was a theatrical explosion. Sarah Kane’s debut, written while she was a student, features a nasty tabloid journalist holed up in a Leeds hotel with a much younger woman, whom he sexually abuses. The world of the play – and its conventional theatrical form – is then blasted apart becoming a war zone: a soldier bursts in, explosions go off, and short scenes of grim horror unfold (stage directions include “he eats the baby”). Famously described as a “disgusting feast of filth”, Blasted was seen by critics as a puerile attempt to shock, and anointed as the classic example of provocative, Nineties in-yer-face theatre. But it’s since become canonical. It doesn’t seem to grow old: Kane’s writing has a horribly vivid energy, and the atrocities it depicts, depressingly, take on fresh resonance for each generation that discovers it. HWWho committed the first infidelity? Was it a man, or was it a woman? (You can bet it was a man who first thought of this prurient question.) The court in Marivaux\u0027s dark comedy thinks it has created the right laboratory conditions for finding out the answer. Four teenagers have been brought up in complete solitude and then are released into each other\u0027s company where their encounters will furnish “a most original entertainment” for the unseen Prince and his fiancée. The play incisively shows how easy it is to turn a stage into an experimental blank slate. But it feels a bit pervy – the Enlightenment\u0027s idea of reality television. Marivaux is elegantly conscious of the objections. There are razor blades secreted in the rococo décor of his works. PTIt\u0027s easy to make Pirandello sound like a forbiddingly cerebral writer. All his life he played tricksy games with philosophical problems such as the deceptiveness of identity. But his aim was to “to convert intellect into passion” and his best works succeed in doing so. Henry IV is about madness, the appearance of madness, and the consequence of deciding to become trapped within the appearance of madness. The protagonist is an Italian nobleman who falls from his horse at a pageant and comes round, convinced that he\u0027s the medieval German Emperor. For 20 years, he has been allowed to live this illusion, attended by flunkies in period-costume. But now comes an embassy bent on “shocking” him from this idee fixe. Richard Harris and Ian McDiarmid were the last pair to play Henry in the West End and they relished the chance to interweave the quizzicality and raw pain that the part requires. The predicament of the central character feels more tragicomically stimulating than far-fetched. PT3840 A Raisin in the Sun (1959), Lorraine HansberryThis play made history: the first on Broadway written by a black woman (shamefully, Britain wouldn’t have its equivalent – a play in the West End by a black British woman – until last year, with Natasha Gordon’s Nine Night). A Raisin in the Sun looks at the Youngers, an African-American family living in poverty in Chicago, dreaming of a better life – and fearing that their dreams will shrivel up like “a raisin in the sun”. Hansberry’s aching drama exhibits the same forceful tug as an Arthur Miller play, laying out how circumstances can crush hope. Its discussion of black identity, however, still crackles today – and the emotional punch that Hansberry’s script carries has drawn big names down the decade: Sidney Poitier starred in the premiere, and everyone from Denzel Washington to P Diddy has also had a crack. Hansberry died at only 34 one can’t help but wonder what other plays she might have had on this list. HWCaryl Churchill has been called the Picasso of modern playwrights. Today, at the age of 80, the British playwright continues startlingly to reinvent herself. Far Away is a twisted fairy tale that demonstrates her matchless gift for merging the apocalyptic and the fantastical. It unfolds in three episodes that shelve steeply. In the first, Joan is quizzing her aunt about what she has just accidentally witnessed. It sounds as if she has espied a bloody act of ethnic cleansing. Then the play escalates into a blackly hilarious vision of cosmic warfare. Partisan brutality has now spread from humans to the animal and mineral world. “The cats have come in on the side of the French,” someone says earnestly. The “natural goodness of deer has come through” says someone else. This is characteristic of Churchill, finding a brilliantly absurdist way of attacking the pernicious myth that there is a simple ide between virtue and evil, “them” and “us”. A sliver of genius. PTTom Stoppard sometimes gets accused of being all head and no heart – but this play proves otherwise. Yes, it’s a mind-achingly clever look at both science and art, pitting the rational against the romantic, while giving you mini lessons in chaos theory, the second law of thermodynamics and the life and shaggings of Lord Byron. But there’s a love story and a tragedy here, that in a well-calibrated production can be very moving. Two stories, set in the same country house, in 1809 and the present day, intersect and eventually overlap beautifully. The mathematic theorising forecasts hope as well as disaster for the universe, and the story offers the same for its characters. HWCalderon\u0027s play is one of the masterpieces of the Spanish Golden Age. The predicament of the young prince, Segismundo, calls to mind the Chinese sage\u0027s story of the man who dreams he is a butterfly and wakes to wonder whether he is actually a butterfly dreaming he is a man. This youth is at the mercy of political fluctuation: he\u0027s been imprisoned in a dark tower from birth because of a horoscope that predicted he would usurp the throne. Then, when there are anxieties about the succession, his father has him drugged, brought to the Palace, and bafflingly treated like a prince. A poetic piece that tackles deep metaphysical, political matters in a dazzlingly theatrical way. PTA play of astonishing breakthroughs. There had been plenty of soliloquies in Elizabethan drama beforehand. But no-one had ever talked to an audience like Hamlet. He doesn\u0027t just let you into his confidence, he lets you into his consciousness the best portrayals make you feel that you are soul-to-soul with this figure. It\u0027s his capacity for searching introspection that gets in the way and disqualifies Hamlet as a revenge hero: he\u0027s rather wonderfully miscast. Hamlet is brilliantly self-reflexive, constantly probing its own theatricality. The conscience of Claudius is tested by a play-within-a play Hamlet tries to fool the court by assuming an “antic disposition” that may at times waver into authentic madness. The piece is like a painful meditation on the contradicting meanings of the verb to “act” – to feign and to intervene. Inexhaustible. PTFeminism and expressionism collide in US playwright Sophie Treadwell\u0027s extraordinary vision of a mechanised, dehumanising metropolis. We feel the nerve-shredding racket of modern existence – described as “this purgatory of noise” – assaulting the Everywoman character at every stage as she makes her descent to doom. She\u0027s a stenographer, a sensitive cog in the machine who is blackmailed by her mother into marriage with a boss who revolts her, and ends up condemned to the electric chair for murdering him. Treadwell\u0027s nagging dialogue, with its jangly staccato and syncopated telegraphese, uncannily anticipates Harold Pinter and David Mamet. Her cry against institutionalised misogyny – “I will not submit” – resounds down the ages. PTIn Gogol\u0027s great phantasmagoric farce, an impecunious clerk newly arrived from St Petersburg is mistakenly assumed to be the eponymous inspector by the corrupt mayor and officials of this provincial town. Panic drives these paranoid locals to project a false identity onto this stranger. That would have been a good enough joke. Gogol, though, gives it an inspired, twist. His penniless nonenity turns out to be driven by an equivalent dread of being recognised as one of life\u0027s losers. So when he twigs to their exploitable mistake, he treats their absurd respect (not to mention their bribes) as long-overdue recognition of his true worth and becomes airborne with grandiosity. It\u0027s the interlocking lunacies that generate the comic delirium in this Russian masterpiece. PTOne of Pinter\u0027s most haunting and unnerving pieces. A married couple, Kate and Deeley, play games of power and possessiveness with the wife\u0027s former flatmate, Anna, who comes to visit for the first time in 20 years. The piece is horribly preoccupied with the use people make of selective – and conceivably invented – memories as weapon or way of gaining the upper hand. We mint memories, in this understanding of it, in response to the psychological needs of the moment: “There are things I remember which may never have happened, but as I recall them.” Deeley is threatened by Anna\u0027s youthful relationship to his wife and strongly attracted to the newcomer. There’s a wonderful evocation of rackety London when the girls lived as secretaries, but the uneasy comedy of all this turns lethal. PTThe best Jacobean tragedy outside Shakespeare, The Changeling also seems to anticipate film noir. The heroine hires a shady type to bump off her fiance. This villain has a facial disfigurement, but the piece is alert to how perversely attracted we are to what repels us. The assassin demands her virginity as his blood-money and the slide into shadowy corruption becomes inexorable. There is a subplot in a madhouse that is designed as a distorted mirror of the main action in its obsession with disguise, lunacy, and sex. PTThis Pulitzer-winning American playwright explores the history of her great-grandmother in early 20th century New York. Esther is a black seamstress – unmarried and illiterate – who sews ravishingly beautiful garments for other women to wear on their wedding nights. She gets what could be a last chance of happiness but it\u0027s destroyed in circumstances that are never sentimentalised. The sensual feel of fine fabric (her means of supporting and expressing herself) is conveyed with gorgeous descriptive power. Intimate Apparel manages to be uplifting without ever losing its irreverent humour. PTSophocles\u0027s play is still the most powerful ever written about the conflict between our obligations to the state and our duty to the ties of kinship. Antigone defies her uncle Kreon, the new ruler of Thebes, by burying her brother Polyneikes. He had brought an army against his native city and Kreon, in these politically volatile times, wants his corpse left for the dogs as an exemplary desecration. The philosopher Hegel saw this as the quintessence of true tragedy: not a conflict between good and evil, but between right and right. In fact, productions nowadays tend to come down in favour of Antigone and her self-sacrificing intransigence. PTRichard Bean had the inspired idea of transposing Goldoni\u0027s 18th century commedia dell\u0027arte romp from Venice to Brighton in 1963. Our jack-the-lad hero – frantically trying to hold down a pair of jobs, unbeknownst to either boss – is a failed skiffle player. The complications are deliciously warped. One character does a bunk to Brighton disguised as her psychotic twin brother who has been bumped off by her posh twit of a boyfriend in a gangland brawl. Still with me? The dialogue is naughty and knowing, but there\u0027s a terrific innocent joy to the physical clowning which peaks in the delirious sequence where our hero has to dish up lunch to the two masters at the same time. PTA supreme example of how a writer can make a play by putting together a triptych of miniatures. Holman was brought up in the pacifist tradition and Making Noise Quietly looks at the long-range effects of war in three chance encounters. In the first, set in a Kent field in 1943, a northern Quaker and an uninhibited London aesthete discuss their reasons for not fighting. In the second, a naval officer arrives to tell a mother of her son’s death in the Falklands War. The third is set in the Black Forest in 1986. An English private, gone AWOL with his disturbed eight-year-old stepson, come into testing collision with a rich German businesswoman who survived the Holocaust. There\u0027s a stunning scene in which she draws the little boy out of his dogmatic mutism by her repeated, stern insistence that he says “thank you” it\u0027s uplifing in the end but it\u0027s not pretty. Writing of rare sensitivity and cumulative power. PTThough he described it as “the lightest of light comedies”, Private Lives is the Noel Coward play that one would undoubtedly preserve for posterity. He wrote it as a vehicle for himself and Gertrude Lawrence, with indecent speed. The play centres on two orcees who, five years after their split, bump into each other on adjacent hotel balconies while on the first night of honeymoons with their new spouses. An elegantly contrived coincidence followed by a pattern of cheekily reversed expectations: most comedies end in marriage this one begins with nobbled nuptials as the couple unceremoniously ditch their second partners and abscond to Paris together. Elyot and Amanda are the kind of flighty egotistical couple that can neither live together nor apart. Anti-romantic comedy soaked in sex (and romance): “Don\u0027t quibble Sybil.” PT1240 Angels in America (1990-93), Tony KushnerSubtitled “A Gay Fantasia on National Themes”, Tony Kushner\u0027s astonishing two-part play is set in the AIDS crisis of the mid-1980s during the right wing administration of Ronald Reagan. The word AIDS was never mentioned by the President, and the struggle to find a cure was hampered by a lack of government recognition. Kushner retaliated by putting gay men centre stage in an epic that shows them fighting to forge their private and public destinies. This is, however, very far from a conventional “issue” play in its glorious ambition. The piece rages from Antarctica and the damaged ozone layer to a baroque heaven that god has abandoned. Prophetic angels crash through ceilings. There are “mutual dream” sequences where people wander in and out of each other\u0027 fantasies. The presiding demon of the piece is one of drama\u0027s greatest monsters: the incorrigible and shameless Roy Cohn was a real-life Republican fixer (and mentor to the young Donald Trump). PTA middle-aged woman is buried in a mound of earth first up to the waist then, after the interval, up to the neck. It is a sight that has never lost its capacity to startle. Beckett\u0027s Winnie prattles away dogged with optimism (“This will have been another happy day”) in a loquacious attempt to stave off hysteria and despair at her encroaching fate. Partly irritating, partly heroic, she brings forth a dotty lyrical monologue that\u0027s threaded with genteel half-remembered wisps from the “immortal” classics. Peter Hall, who directed Peggy Ashcroft in the part, rightly pointed out that “Beckett\u0027s theatre is as much about mime and physical precision as it is about words”. Except that his texts are great and this one is superb beyond belief. To quote Winnie: “What is that unforgettable line?” PT1440  Long Day’s Journey into Night (1940), Eugene O NeillWhen O\u0027Neill described Long Day\u0027s Journey as a “play of old sorrow, written in blood and tears”, he was barely exaggerating. This enormous autobiographical drama is so raw and unremitting in its revelations about his dysfunctional Irish-Catholic family that the author left instructions – mercifully disobeyed by his widow – that the play was not to be performed until 25 years after his death. You can understand the trepidation. Long Day\u0027s Journey plunges deep into the tortured heart of the Tyrones – James, the acclaimed actor who sold out to commercial success, his wife Mary who has recently relapsed into morphine addiction, and their two sons. When the play is under the baton of the right director, it\u0027s the like listening to the recapitulations in a great piece of music. You emerge drained but in a state of elating catharsis. PTHector wants to teach boys knowledge that will last them a lifetime. But the headmaster has become obsessed with government league tables and has hired Irwin to teach them glib, exam-passing techniques. That\u0027s the clash at the heart of Alan Bennett\u0027s hugely popular hit. It\u0027s set at a Yorkshire grammar amongst a group of clever sixth-formers. As with a lot of Bennett\u0027s work you can discern a revue-like structure in the play\u0027s glorious string of skits, gags, songs and sheer elating silliness. But it\u0027s also a brilliant portrait of a maverick teacher. The scene in which the doomed Hector analyses the Hardy poem “Drummer Hodge” with his pupil Posner is unsurpassed in drama as an example of humane teaching. Gay, unhappy Posner also has the play\u0027s best joke: “I\u0027m a Jew. I\u0027m small. I\u0027m homosexual. And I live in Sheffield. I\u0027m fucked.” PTFrank Hardy, an itinerant Irish faith healer, his wife, and his manager tell four monologues that contradict each other, leaving the audience to question truth and memory, lies and storytelling. Frank struggles to understand his own “gift”, and how his ability to cure comes and goes Faith Healer is also a parable about the artist and his inspiration. The play foundered when it opened on Broadway, but has since been recognised as a modern classic: in a good production, there’s a trembling sort of power to it. Friel’s writing can be rhythmical, incantatory, but it’s also gorgeously subtle. Although Friel throughout maintains a – crucial – ambivalence, the play attains a sort of transcendent grace of its own. HWPlays by this American writer tend to be long, slow – and strangely riveting. It’s hard to pin down what exactly makes John so bewitching. It is set in a kitschy, tat-filled Gettysburg guesthouse, where a fighting young couple interact with the dotty landlady and her blind but visionary friend. The house seems haunted: creepy dolls and pianos start playing themselves. But it’s also haunted by history (it was a civil war hospital), and by the older women’s memories of love, ghosts, and their own mystical experiences. All of this is a little spooky, but also rather emotionally stirring. Baker is also super sharp on the millennial couple’s dying relationship, which opens out into a look at how it’s often women who have to prop up men’s myths, to feed their needy hunger. HWFrom “I have always depended on the kindness of strangers” to “Stellaaaaaa”, Williams’s play has entered the popular consciousness. As well it might: there’s something eternal in its themes of loss, ageing, and the lies we live by. Fear and lust rub up against each other, sweatily few other writers have captured the heat of the South like Williams, and this is the playwright at his most atmospheric. Blanche DuBois – the deluded southern belle who shacks up with her sister and her macho, abusive husband – is a summit part for an actress, and everyone from Vivien Leigh to Tallulah Bankhead, Cate Blanchett to Gillian Anderson have had a go. HWThe only surviving full trilogy of Greek tragedies, through Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and The Eumenides Aeschylus traces the impact of violence and revenge down a Royal family, throwing questions of justice and duty into sharp relief. To win the Trojan war, Agamemnon sacrificed his daughter the trilogy opens with a play in which his wife Clytemnestra kills him to avenge her daughter’s death. In Libation Bearers, Clytemnestra’s son Orestes murders her in retaliation (if Antigone is a tragedy because it’s a conflict between right and right, this is perhaps a clash between wrong and wrong). The cycle is broken in Eumenides, where the gods form a court in which to try Orestes. It’s juicy, meaty, high-octane stuff – and has been given era-defining productions both in Peter Hall masked version at the National in 1981, and in Robert Icke’s crisp modern adaptation in 2015. HWPart of the playwright’s cycle exploring the African-American experience in 20th century American –  a play for each decade – this chapter is set in a Chicago recording studio in 1927. Ma Rainey, the “mother of the blues”, is slow to show up to record some tunes. Instead, we watch her band kill time and spar with one another. Although it all lands light as a butterfly, the script is stinging on subjects such as ambition and race relations. Ma Rainey, when she arrives, proves worth waiting for: an immense, haughty presence. There’s a twist towards the end, giving the play punch – plus the tunes are great, of course. HWIbsen wrote great women: we could have gone for Hedda Gabler. But A Doll’s House is one of those plays with a wide significance: written in 1879, it’s a proto-feminist text. When our troubled heroine Nora slams the door at the end of the play, it’s not just on her patronising husband, but on the whole of The Patriarchy. The play shocked some in its portrayal of a woman made so desperate by her suffocating domestic situation that she abandons her children as well as her husband, choosing freedom and self-actualistion over the prison of the home. Of course, things have changed for women since, but this exceptionally controlled play still unfolds perfectly – and that slam still resonates. HWYou could make a case for any of Chekhov’s plays really (we nearly went for his early, entertaining Platonov, just to be different) but the lucidity of The Seagull wins out. It’s got more plot, a sliver less ennui, than some of his others: a young man, Konstantin, longs to be a playwright his narcissistic mother Arkadina – an actress – is wrapped up in her new boyfriend, Trigorin, a successful novelist. He in turn romances Nina, Konstantin’s girlfriend and an aspiring actress. It’s not much of a spoiler to say none of their dreams exactly come true, life proving endlessly, exquisitely disappointing. The Seagull is a mordant comedy – scenes skewering both Arkadina’s monstrous ego and her son’s attempts at avant garde art are some of the best bits of theatre-about-theatre ever. But there’s also an unbearable tenderness to the play’s portrayal of young love, hope, and idealism. HW2340  Mother Courage and Her Children (1939), Bertolt Brecht Few, if any, playwrights of the 20th century had as much of an impact on theatre as Brecht: he wanted art to be a political tool rather than escapist entertainment, but also revolutionised theatrical form and style, doing away with naturalism. But it can mean his “epic theatre” is still associated with didacticism, rather than drama. Not so Mother Courage, though, which is epic in both senses: written after Hitler invaded Poland, but set during the Thirty-Years\u0027 War, it is a potent story of one mother’s attempts to profit from conflict, and the huge cost war always takes in the end. HWBased on the Greek myth where Medea kills her children in order to get revenge on her unfaithful husband, this tragedy has lost none of its force – or power to shock. But the text allows more sympathetic readings Medea too, as a woman fighting for justice in an unjust world. With a monumental lead part, and a chorus who react and comment on the action, the play has always been one of the most popular of the Greek tragedies. Taut and tense, you see the horror coming but feel desperately compelled to look. HWThe mother of a murdered child. Her imprisoned paedophile killer. A criminal psychologist attempting to understand what drove him to do it. Through first monologues, and then dialogue, this modem classic has much to say about the extremes of human anguish, but also our capacity for change, and for forgiveness. It’s a dark and thorny work, but a deeply humane one too, by a prolific British writer at her best. HW2640 The Importance of Being Earnest (1895), Oscar Wilde Has there every been such a reliably delightful comedy? The improbable plot of tangled engagements, lost handbags, invented wicked relatives, and real monstrous aunts runs like clockwork. There are innumerable blissful one-liners, the characters are delicious upper-class twits, and at every turn Wilde has a fine old time pricking societal niceties. It’s frothy fun, and funny froth, and always invites larger-than-life performances. Being so very bankable has led to Wilde’s play certainly being over-staged and it now feels thoroughly un-urgent – and then it makes you laugh all over again. HWSherman’s harrowing play pulls the rug from under you. You invest in the relationship between Max and Rudy, a decadent gay couple in Berlin in 1934 – but after the Night of the Long Knives they flee, before being caught and sent to Dachau. On the way, Max’s desire to survive produces sickening betrayal. He pretends to be Jewish rather than gay, but in the camp meets Horst, a man who reveals the honour in being true to one’s self. There’s an astonishing scene where – forbidden to touch – they have sex purely through words. Ian McKellen originally played Max, but Richard Gere and Alan Cummings have also taken on the role in what is now seen as seminal gay text – one that proves truth and love may flower in the most horrific, hopeless circumstances. HWAh, the transformative power of theatre… This familiar idea is irresistibly proven by Wertenbaker’s oft-revived play, based on a true story about a group of convicts in an Australian penal colony who put on a production of George Farquhar’s The Recruiting Officer. It has fun sending up the pretensions of theatre, but ultimately uses it as means for talking about empathy, communication, and understanding, as relations between the reviled prisoners and the cruel officers thaw. A direct piece of storytelling with a huge heart. HWLucy Prebble made her name with ENRON, charting the hubris of the financial giant, but while it may be less flashy, The Effect is still dazzlingly good. It has, at its heart, a question we’d all like to know the answer to: what is love? The play follows two volunteers in a clinical trial for a new anti-depressant when they fall for each other, they wonder whether their love is “real”, or a by-product. And given all interactions in the brain are just chemical, does it even matter? The idea of what’s really real and what’s really romantic, what happiness is and what function unhappiness might have, are turned over by Prebble’s own very sharp mind. Her characters are fun to spend time with, her dialogue is snappy, but she digs deep too, into both scientific theories and human emotions, taking us from the grey lows of depression to the technicolour highs of new love. HWIt can be hard to separate this play from an animating original performance by the great Mark Rylance, who played Johnny “Rooster” Byron – a wild misfit who lives in a caravan in the woods in rural England, gathering local young people to him like some kind of drink-and-drug-fuelled pied piper. Such a summary might sound tawdry, yet set on St George’s Day and ripe with Rooster’s storytelling, it has a mythic, mystical quality. A state-of-the-nation show powered by anti-establishment brio, it also precisely captures a contemporary rural community (very sweary, and very funny). Jerusalem became a ridiculously big hit, with audiences camping out round the theatre for tickets. But a recent revival suggests the play can still crow, whoever plays Rooster. HWWhat makes a great play? A lot of critics, academics, and playwrights themselves will point to form matching content. On this, Tim Crouch’s glitteringly clever play really delivers – while also being extremely moving. A stage hypnotist encounters the father of a girl he killed in a car accident. The father truly believes his daughter has been transformed into oak tree. At every performance, the father is played by an actor who’s never seen or read the play before they are given a script or fed lines by – yes – the hypnotist (played initially by Crouch himself, also acknowledging his “real” role as the playwright). The actor is transformed before us we accept that they are now the father. An Oak Tree has a radical honesty which has made it hugely influential among younger generation. We always know theatre isn’t “real” – by playfully acknowledging that, the emotional impact is actually heightened. It’s a magic trick where understanding the trickery only makes the magic more real. HWAthol Fugard came to see that the righteous anger of didactic anti-apartheid drama was not as effective as the subversive laughter of the black townships when it came to getting across the harshness of the conditions there. Certainly, there is nothing moralising or solemn about this piece which was developed by Fugard from improvisations with the great John Kani and Winston Ntosha who first performed it. A mischievous shaggy dog story, it pulls the audience into an atmosphere of good-humoured sociability. Sizwe is a work-seeker in Port Elizabeth who can\u0027t get a job because he doesn\u0027t have a permit. It turns out that he has found a dead man\u0027s pass book and has substituted his own photo, killing off Sizwe Bansi. A deceptively light and humane play that outlasts the apartheid era. PT3340 Purgatory in Ingolstadt (1924)  Pioneers in Ingolstadt (1928), Marieluise FleisserMarieluise Fleisser, the author of these sorely neglected plays, was the lover, protégée, and victim of Bertolt Brecht, and her subject was the lower Bavarian city of her birth. The plays use a bold collage technique instead of linear narrative, and she had penetrating insights into its vicious pack mentality and conformist claustrophobia. In Purgatory, she evokes a stifling Catholic ethos: we see two very different rebels (one girl seeks in vain for an abortion) who suffer the humiliation of having to crawl back to the pack. Brecht effectively hijacked her second play Pioneers (about the contact between the inhabitants and a visiting squad of bridge-builders). He imposed overt anti-militarism and sensationalising sex, and Fleisser was denounced as a traitor to German womanhood. Stephen Daldry and Annie Castledine directed a superb version of these plays at the tiny Gate Theatre in 1991. Since when, nothing. It\u0027s high time Fleisser was given her due. PTTempting as it is to include Michael Frayn’s sublimely funny backstage farce, Noises Off, the more serious Copenhagen just pips it. It imagines a real meeting between nuclear physicists, the Dane Niels Bohr and German Werner Heisenberg, in Copenhagen in 1941, to discuss developments that will lead to the atomic bomb. Then he reimagines the meeting, and reimagines it again – after all, no-one really knows what happened. Was Heisenberg warning his old friend of the Nazis’ advances in nuclear weapons? Hoping for a mutual pact to prevent the atomic bomb? Seeking absolution? Looking at the unreliability of memory, the structure of Frayn’s play is cleverly animated by the scientific ideas his characters discuss: Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is the basis for its dramatic form. A big hit when it opened at the National, it went to the West End, Broadway – and wound up on TV, starring Daniel Craig. HWThis play was a theatrical explosion. Sarah Kane’s debut, written while she was a student, features a nasty tabloid journalist holed up in a Leeds hotel with a much younger woman, whom he sexually abuses. The world of the play – and its conventional theatrical form – is then blasted apart becoming a war zone: a soldier bursts in, explosions go off, and short scenes of grim horror unfold (stage directions include “he eats the baby”). Famously described as a “disgusting feast of filth”, Blasted was seen by critics as a puerile attempt to shock, and anointed as the classic example of provocative, Nineties in-yer-face theatre. But it’s since become canonical. It doesn’t seem to grow old: Kane’s writing has a horribly vivid energy, and the atrocities it depicts, depressingly, take on fresh resonance for each generation that discovers it. HWWho committed the first infidelity? Was it a man, or was it a woman? (You can bet it was a man who first thought of this prurient question.) The court in Marivaux\u0027s dark comedy thinks it has created the right laboratory conditions for finding out the answer. Four teenagers have been brought up in complete solitude and then are released into each other\u0027s company where their encounters will furnish “a most original entertainment” for the unseen Prince and his fiancée. The play incisively shows how easy it is to turn a stage into an experimental blank slate. But it feels a bit pervy – the Enlightenment\u0027s idea of reality television. Marivaux is elegantly conscious of the objections. There are razor blades secreted in the rococo décor of his works. PTIt\u0027s easy to make Pirandello sound like a forbiddingly cerebral writer. All his life he played tricksy games with philosophical problems such as the deceptiveness of identity. But his aim was to “to convert intellect into passion” and his best works succeed in doing so. Henry IV is about madness, the appearance of madness, and the consequence of deciding to become trapped within the appearance of madness. The protagonist is an Italian nobleman who falls from his horse at a pageant and comes round, convinced that he\u0027s the medieval German Emperor. For 20 years, he has been allowed to live this illusion, attended by flunkies in period-costume. But now comes an embassy bent on “shocking” him from this idee fixe. Richard Harris and Ian McDiarmid were the last pair to play Henry in the West End and they relished the chance to interweave the quizzicality and raw pain that the part requires. The predicament of the central character feels more tragicomically stimulating than far-fetched. PT3840 A Raisin in the Sun (1959), Lorraine HansberryThis play made history: the first on Broadway written by a black woman (shamefully, Britain wouldn’t have its equivalent – a play in the West End by a black British woman – until last year, with Natasha Gordon’s Nine Night). A Raisin in the Sun looks at the Youngers, an African-American family living in poverty in Chicago, dreaming of a better life – and fearing that their dreams will shrivel up like “a raisin in the sun”. Hansberry’s aching drama exhibits the same forceful tug as an Arthur Miller play, laying out how circumstances can crush hope. Its discussion of black identity, however, still crackles today – and the emotional punch that Hansberry’s script carries has drawn big names down the decade: Sidney Poitier starred in the premiere, and everyone from Denzel Washington to P Diddy has also had a crack. Hansberry died at only 34 one can’t help but wonder what other plays she might have had on this list. HWCaryl Churchill has been called the Picasso of modern playwrights. Today, at the age of 80, the British playwright continues startlingly to reinvent herself. Far Away is a twisted fairy tale that demonstrates her matchless gift for merging the apocalyptic and the fantastical. It unfolds in three episodes that shelve steeply. In the first, Joan is quizzing her aunt about what she has just accidentally witnessed. It sounds as if she has espied a bloody act of ethnic cleansing. Then the play escalates into a blackly hilarious vision of cosmic warfare. Partisan brutality has now spread from humans to the animal and mineral world. “The cats have come in on the side of the French,” someone says earnestly. The “natural goodness of deer has come through” says someone else. This is characteristic of Churchill, finding a brilliantly absurdist way of attacking the pernicious myth that there is a simple ide between virtue and evil, “them” and “us”. A sliver of genius. PTTom Stoppard sometimes gets accused of being all head and no heart – but this play proves otherwise. Yes, it’s a mind-achingly clever look at both science and art, pitting the rational against the romantic, while giving you mini lessons in chaos theory, the second law of thermodynamics and the life and shaggings of Lord Byron. But there’s a love story and a tragedy here, that in a well-calibrated production can be very moving. Two stories, set in the same country house, in 1809 and the present day, intersect and eventually overlap beautifully. The mathematic theorising forecasts hope as well as disaster for the universe, and the story offers the same for its characters.

More than  per cent of voters in my mining villages voted Leave in .”She concluded rightly that the public “feel MPs should work together to resolve Brexit” instead of “slugging it out.”Her attacks at the weekend on the anti-Brexit brigade are part of a consistent pattern since , driven by her belief that the will of the British people must be fulfilled.Her approach is all the more potent because she actually voted Remain in the referendum.But, unlike too many other Remainers in Parliament, she accepted the verdict and has battled to make Brexit work.In that quest, she has had no time for the Parliamentary shenanigans and legalistic manoeuvres that have dominated the withdrawal process, with MPs always “kicking the issue down the road.”Nor, in contrast to most of Labour, does she favour membership of the Single Market and Customs Union, which she said in  would represent “staying in the EU in all but name.”For her principled stand, she has been viciously condemned by others on the left, who have called her a Tory, a turncoat and a traitor.With typical fortitude she has shown no signs of buckling.“I was not elected to Parliament to bow to threats and intimidation. I won’t now,” she says.The charge of treachery is absurd, given that she is abiding by Labour’s  manesto.Moreover, she has devoted most of her adult le to the party.Caroline Flint in  - shes been a Labour MP for  yearsHer warm but steely confidence is a reflection of her tough working-class upbringing.Her deprived background is very dferent from the worlds of privilege inhabited by so many of the affluent liberal Remainers.She was born in  in a home for unmarried mothers in London, the daughter of a -year-old typist Wendy Beasley who later died of alcohol-related liver problems.Flint never knew her biological father.At the age of two, she was adopted by a couple who lived in a one bedroom flat.“My sister and I slept on one side and my parents on the other,” she later recalled of her childhood.Her adoptive parents split up when she was .Her dficulties continued into her young adulthood.Though she was the first member of her family to go to university, she embarked in  on a disastrous marriage to Saief Zammel, a Tunisian stockbroker, by whom she had two children.The marriage fell apart after a series of incidents, including Zammel’s arrest on charges of violent disorder.He was eventually deported from Britain, and Flint was left to bring up their children alone.These were hard times, during which she was turned down for a job at Woolworth’s.But she turned her le around, partly through her involvement with the Labour movement.An MP for  years, she has been a card-carrying Labour member for  years, since she first joined when she was just .Before she was elected to the Commons, she worked as an official for the GMB trade union.“She has more integrity in her little finger than many in that place,” says her fellow Labour MP Laura Smith, referring to the barrage of criticism Flint has endured in Parliament.Despite the fury from the pro-EU mob, she seems to have her Don Valley constituency behind her, precisely because she represents its views.“I think she’s wonderful, absolutely wonderful. She has listened to her constituents, it’s as simple as that,” said Bob Davis, an engineer.Flint was reelected by her constituency Labour party last week, after a petition to throw her out got just  signatures.Part of the admiration for her stems from her capacity – as she has shown over Brexit – to speak her own mind, instead of meekly following the trendy left-wing orthodoxy.So while others in her party wailed about Tory benefit cuts, she attacked the culture of welfare dependency, where claimants expected something for nothing.Given her experience, it is a travesty to pretend she is some kind of anti-Labour hack.With her roots in the working-class, she is far more in touch with ordinary people that most posturing, preening Remainers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Under Theresa May’s we could have been trapped in it forever, unable to do global trade deals.To put it back into the agreement kills it. Not least because the deal agreed with Brussels is merely the mechanism by which we leave — it is not meant to determine our future relationship.One Labour MP vows to support Boris’s Bill, then back this amendment destroying it. If the public considers MPs ocean-going idiots, this is why.But the EU should help get the deal over the line by rejecting the extension Remainers forced the PM to request.MPs would have to pass it or revoke Brexit. They lack the guts for the latter.HARRY and Meghan are not victims. Not of tabloid “bullying”. Not of racism.Their claim that they are “existing, not living” is a tin-eared insult to millions who find joy despite daily struggles dwarfing those of this cosseted pair.The Sun could not have been happier for them when they married. We called their magical wedding “a wonderful symbol of the country we have become. Open, warm-hearted, brilliantly erse”.We’re sorrythey didn’t understand that along with the adulation would come other stories in the public interest — and scrutinythey chose to lecture the public on how to live their lives.Instead of maturely accepting it, or ignoring it, they declared war on the Press and indulged in a giant whinge.No, Royals with publicly-funded mansions, fabulous holidays and staff are not disqualied from being unhappy. Harry and Meghan do seem to be ­vulnerable and need help. But they should count their many blessings too.And spare a thought for those who endure crippling rents, mortgages, bills and tough, low-paid jobs with far more fortitude and less self-pity.FUNNY how so many MPs trashing our democracy no longer have skin in the game.Take giggling birdbrain Oliver Letwin whose calamitous career, a bulging ­dossier of catastrophic failure, will end before the next election. Or Speaker Bercow — the grandiloquent, circumlocutory, periphrastic, tautological Remainer slug — who is off soon too.Meanwhile Labour is now openly betraying its  Leave voters while desperately trying to avoid an election.So many politicians — unaccountable and yet key to thwarting the .million majority.

Meghan is struggling with le as a new motherand the global attention that comes with joining the “The Firm”. And Harry wants to protect her.But their latest complaints seemed poorly timed and worryingly self-indulgent. How  can you describe the royal couple seeing impoverished young African girls learning to box so they can fight off sexual predators, then using air time to address their First World problems with the media The same media, I might add, that was praising Meghan’s obvious intelligence and charm and had hitherto featured glowing reports from their first official overseas tour together.Prince William is reportedly “worried” about his brother’s state of mind, and after watching the documentary Harry  Meghan: An African Journey, one could only agree and conclude that we’re seeing a man teetering on the edge.The rampant paranoia, the relentless victim narrative and a tendency towards the dramatic are all perhaps signs that Harry does indeed need to take a break from public le before he unravels even further.But during that respite, he must surely seek specialist help and ask himself this: Is his obvious angst really just down to the media occasionally writing inconvenient truths about his we’s fractured family and questioning the couple’s obvious hypocrisy at using private jets while preaching about climate change OR is it the result of unresolved issues surrounding his mother Diana’s untimely death  My money’s on the latter, not least because Harry’s escalating rhetoric around the “safety of my family” rang alarm bells with me.As a child, my husband witnessed the accidental death of his -month- old brother and was put in the ambulance with his screaming mother. When he was , his -year- old father died suddenly at home during an afternoon nap.Both were deeply traumatic events that, by the time we met in , he thought he’d dealt with. But, in late , the birth of our daughter triggered a delayed response and he became riven with anxiety that something might happen to her.He developed the now resolved habit of what psychiatrist’s might refer to as “catastrophising” where, in his mind, a cut finger would escalate to potential sepsis and, like  Harry, “the safety of my ­family”  was an oft repeated mantra to try to  quash rational debate.Put simply, he felt a loss of ­control over what happened to his brother and father, which then manested itself in a disproportionately dramatic reaction to even the simplest of le’s problems and an inability to see past them.So I can only wonder whether the birth of his son Archie has triggered the same powerful reaction in Harry, who admits he thought he was out of the woods with his mental health, “but suddenly it all came back.” It would certainly explain his tears at the recent WellChild Awards, where his speech centred on his and Meghan’s feelings since having achild rather than focusing on the stories of those being celebrated.And it was “the safety of my family” he used to explain the use of private jets when, just a few days later, William and Kate — the future King and Queen of Britain — quietly boarded a commercial flight to Scotland with their kids and the dference in attitudes was there for all to see.Both William and Harry suffered the untimely loss of their mother and — wrongly, to my mind — faced the intolerable pressure of having to walk behind her coffin while the world looked on.BUT as William has clearly learned toaround the trauma and get on with his le in a mature and rational way, Harry still seems troubled, angry and prone to irrational outbursts.“I will not be bullied into playing a game that killed my mum,” he declared to interviewer and friend Tom Bradby.The tragic sequence of events that led to the death of his mother were going to the Paris Ritz with an international playboy, deciding to leave the safety of their hotel suite at midnight when they knew there were motorbike paps outside, unwittingly getting into a car driven by someone well over the drink-drive limit and not wearing a seatbelt.So yes, the paparazzi followed the carand, in an ideal world, they wouldn’t have.But a French inquiry cleared the bikes of involvement in the crash and, in the real world, anyone famous knows thatyou don’t want to be “papped” you live your le accordingly by maintaining a low profile and avoiding celebrity hang-outs.The Cambridges know that ­living a quiet, unremarkable le is the greatest antidote to unwanted media attention but also accept that the trade-off for the privilege le of being royal is that, ­occasionally, there will be “off message” stories and opinions they don’t like.On the South Africa tour, tetchy Prince Harry behaved like an entitled elite when he chastised Sky’s invited royal correspondent Rhiannon Mills for asking him a perfectly anodyne question about his visit.Later, while reporting from William and Kate’s hugely successful tour of Pakistan, Rhiannon praised the Cambridges for their regular and friendly interactions with the media.She observes that they clearly understand that official duty for Queen and country come first.“Compare it with the tone of the end of Prince Harry and Meghan’s tour a few weeks ago and you couldn’t have a bigger contrast,” she adds. “Harry had made it all about them by releasing a statement announcing legal action against The Mail on Sunday and criticising the Press.”EQUALLY, it’s worth noting that, like Meghan, Kate also had to adapt to royal le and, despite being mum to three young children, has never publicly complained about her lot.Probably because she understands that there are millions of people in the country with far worse problems and without the support network or finances to cushion the blow.That’s a rational outlook but, right now, Harry is clearly locked in a victim narrative where the nasty Press hunted his mother to her death and even the mildest criticism of him or his we is taken as “bullying” behaviour that threatens their very existence.I feel sympathy for him, but only he can change that self-pitying narrative, with his we’s support. Unfortunately, unlike Kate, Meghan doesn’t have a close-knit family around her and, judging by what she said in the same ­documentary, may be enabling rather than ­calming his paranoia.She said her British friends had warned her off marrying Harry because “the British tabloids will destroy your le.” Really  Or did they rightly just advise that the Press attention would be several notches higher than she’d been used to  Particularly as she has a rather off- message family Certainly not the poor man at Wimbledon who got ticked off by “Meghan’s ­people” for trying to take a photo of her when he was actually taking a selfie.No, it’s definitely time for a ­period of rest and, ­hopefully, reflection.  And , at the end of it, they decide to step away from royal le and live as private citizens, then we wish them nothing but the best.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Boris believes in better times.Like Buzz Lightyear he punches the air and cries: “To infinity and beyond!”What do you think when you see Big Ben or a photograph of the twirly-towered Houses of Parliament standing next to the gracious River Thames Most of us, I guess, used to feel a little bounce of patriotism when we heard Big Ben’s bongs.But the bonging has long since ceased to have that effect — indeed, the bongs don’t even sound any more, owing to the repairs being done to the clock tower.The sheer sight of Parliament now, I suspect, fills many voters with feelings of irritation and boredom, and maybe worse.As Bonfire Night approaches, it may never have been easier to sympathise with Guy Fawkes and his gunpowder plotters.This is, please, not an incitement to you all to burrow into the cellars under the Palace of Westminster with barrels of explosives and fizzing fuses.But would it not be tempting to tie a stick or two of dynamite to the tail of Commons Speaker John Bercow Is there not at least a small part of you that would welcome a big, cartoon-style ka-boom in the Commons lavatories and seeing the likes of Hilary Benn and Dominic Grieve QC and Yvette Cooper and Sir Oliver Ruddy Letwin emerging with their faces sooted, their hairdos standing up on end and their trousers round their knocking knees Back in the days of the Soviet Union there was a man called Andrei Gromyko, who was almost a self-parody of grumpiness.Gromyko was foreign minister for the Soviets from - and he undoubtedly had a brilliant mind.Yet there he would stand on the Kremlin’s viewing balcony at the May Day parades, wrapped tight into his smart coat and hat, and his grim, unyielding face said it all.Gromyko wanted no change. He wanted the status quo to last forever.He became known as Mr Nyet. That’s Nyet for No, never forever. Well, the brutal Soviet empire didn’t last for ever, as we now know.Gromyko stood on the wrong side of history. Soviet Marxism was shattered and the Berlin Wall fell.Parliamentary opponents of Brexit will one day be seen to have been similarly obstructive.Like Gromyko, the only answer they have is the negative.It is not because they are stupid. Labour’s Sir Keir Starmer, and that giggling nitwit Letwin, are well-read gents.Hilary Benn is probably brighter than his old man Tony was.Grieve and Anna Soubry are both lawyers, though you might not want them defending you in a big trial in case they got up the jury’s noses with their stone-faced insistence that no one  can possibly ever be right.And then there’s Bercow. The soon-to-depart speaker is a chippy, itchy, batey little piglet and one of the most gloriously public cuckolds of the kingdom but he has a perfectly good brain on him.It’s not lack of cleverness that afflicts them. It is their inability to realise that the public wants hope.Voters crave optimism in their politicians.They want leaders who offer solutions, not dismal shroud-wavers like Labour’s Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell.And after three years of this inertia, the desire for some brightness and happiness has never been keener.That is why Boris is flying in the opinion polls.It may not be that we all like every dotted I and crossed T of his Brexit deal.Plenty of us would have accepted No Deal. It is not that the voters have suddenly become Tories.But they warm to the Johnsonian can-do spirit.When everyone said he would never extract concessions from Brussels, he did.When everyone said he was a shallow joker, he found a statesmanlike tone which hailed European civilisation while embracing British independence.His opponents, lips curling, said he was just a racist, sexist nationalist who would sell out to Donald Trump.Boris crinkled his eyes, spoke up for the NHS and talked of healing and progress.Britain has had enough of the grumps and glumbuckets.Parliament needs to rediscover the miraculous qualities of the words “can” and “yes”.

Civil servants have warned that a later date could force schools to cancel nativity plays to act as polling stations.It means that the next  hours are crucial in how Brexit and a general election plays out.EU ambassadors met last night to try to find a compromise and take stock of the lay of the land.Mr Varadkar has backed a three-month flextension which could be ended earlyMPs ratied the deal before January .But he suggested other leaders disagreed with him, saying: “My bags are always packed for Brussels and packed they are again.”Mrs Merkel also confirmed she would not block another delay, with her spokesman saying it would “not fail due to Germany”.But her country’s foreign minister Heiko Maas said the UK would need to provide assurances it would hold an election to get the full three months.He said: “If it’s a question of pushing Brexit back until the end of January, we’d need to know why. What’s going to happen in the interval and will there be elections in Great Britain ”French President Emmanuel Macron has taken a tougher line still, with his Europe minister Amelie de Montchalin saying the UK should only get a few days to pass the deal.Privately, French officials said the president wanted any extension capped at  days.An EU diplomat told The Sun: “It all hinges on Johnson explaining his plans. If he can’t convince leaders, we’ll need a summit.”Mr Johnson faces a battle to avoid losing on the Queen’s Speech today.He is operating without a majority in the Commons, with just  MPs taking the Conservative whip —  short of the number needed to ensure victory.Losing the Queen’s Speech would traditionally be seen as a no confidence vote and force a PM to quit.Under recent rule changes, the vote is only symbolic — but losing will still be embarrassing.There was also fresh confusion over what checks will be needed between Great Britain and Northern Ireland under the new deal.At PMQs Mr Johnson insisted there would be no checks but this was contradicted by his spokesman and Home Office officials.Border Force Official Paul Lincoln told the Home Affairs committee that minimal electronic submissions would be needed for goods going from Great Britain to Northern ­Ireland.And on Tuesday, Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay admitted Northern Irish businesses moving some goods to Great Britain would require exit summary declarations.Tory MP Michael Fabricant stormed: “Jeremy Corbyn knows that he is even less popular than Michael Foot, so is running scared of an election.”MYSTERY surrounds the fate of the p Brexit coins after MPs wrecked the timetable to leave.At least , have reportedly been pressed already, and may be collectors’ items.Though the Queen doing a facepalm, right, would surely be more appropriate.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She is a sick girl.Pushing her to confess is disgraceful.The interview also focused on how she was the only child of a orced couple.One viewer said: They put Sahar Tabar on TV because of her makeup and tattoos, because she is a child of orce and is making money from her Instagram page.Now you can repeat that we have freedom in Iran.A final tweet joked that she should have committed a less serious crime in the country such as embezzlement, theft and murder than the major crime of making videos.After hitting headlines for her corpse bride appearance in , Sahar reportedly told Russian media outlet Sputnik: This is Photoshop and make-up.Every time I publish a photo, I paint my face in an increasingly funny way.It is a way of expressing yourself, a kind of art.

They don’t filter at all.Scientists have also argued that filters are not just a pointless marketing gimmick, they are actively harmful.In particular, the harmful components of smoke arent captured by the filters.Meanwhile, the website of the Jerome Adams, the US Surgeon General, says: Evidence suggests that ventilated filters may have contributed to higher risks of lung cancer by enabling smokers to inhale more vigorously, thereby drawing carcinogens contained in cigarette smoke more deeply into lung tissue.On top of this, cigarette fillers are a major source of plastic pollution and the greatest single item of litter found in the world.This is because they are made from a type of plastic known as cellulose acetate that does not easily biodegrade.Every year . trillion butts are littered globally and they take ten years to degrade.Environmentalists now want them to be viewed similarly to plastic straws.And a team of scientists wrote in the BMJ: Even though the cellulose acetate filter is the single most commonly collected item of litter globally, the industry has largely succeeded in avoiding the public outrage expressed towards plastic waste.Unlike manufacturers of some other polluting post-consumption waste products, such as refrigerators containing fluorocarbons, it has never been held accountable for the cost of the waste it generates..

Little Michael Labuschagne was rushed to hospital seven months ago when he woke up gasping for air after suffering a cardiac arrest. The now ten-month-old was then put into an induced coma and his parents were told it was likely he would never wake. Against the odds, Michael, from Bristol, awoke when doctors reduced his sedation - opening his eyes and smiling at his dad, Stuart. But that happy moment was quickly tempered by the news that there was a high chance the boy had suffered brain damage. Luckily, a scan revealed that this wasnapost the case. However, Stuart and mum Emma were then delivered the hammer blow that Michael had an extraordinarily rare heart tumour which would need expensive surgery to fix.  Now his desperate mum is trying to raise nearly £, so her sick baby can travel to the USA for an operation after doctors found an incredibly rare tumour - in his HEART. Michaelaposs parents were told he had a cardiac fibroma attached to the septum within the left chamber of his heart - which only a handful of patients have ever been diagnosed with. There is no long-term solution offered on the NHS but Michaelaposs parents discovered a hospital in Boston, USA which can remove the tumour. They now need to raise a staggering £, so he can be cured - and ideally within six months. Mum-of-three Emma, , said: At  weeks and three days old he went to bed like any other baby. But at am he had suffered heart failure.  Words cannot begin to describe the pain we felt in that moment. We watched our baby breathless, gasping for air while his heart stopped and paramedics worked to save his le. In that moment I did not think Michael would make it through. Yet I am so so blessed to be here telling you that he survived. He survived an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest which only seven per cent patients do. Michael was fitted with a pacemaker after waking up from the coma, which unfortunately restricts the totaposs movement. Currently, he is unable to sit up or support his own head. Shop worker Emma said: It does hold him back. Itaposs as big as the size of the palm of my hand and it has sharp edges. Putting that inside a baby is quite uncomfortable for them.

Friends have said the trucker, named locally as -year-old Mo Robinson, raised the alarm himself after finding the victims - all Chinese nationals - dead inside the refrigerated container. Robinson, from Portadown in Northern Ireland, has been arrested on suspicion of murder and was still in custody for questioning on Thursday. The victims were found dead in Grays, Essex, shortly after the trailer was picked up at a port on the River Thames after arriving from Belgium. Have you been affected by the incident  Email webnews@mirror.  A friend claimed Robinson was innocent, telling MailOnline:wouldn’t have known those people were in the back. Apparently he’d parked up at the industrial estate in Essex and had gone to fetch the paperwork from a pocket on the inside of the lorry door. When he opened the container up and saw all the dead bodies, he was absolutely horried - as anyone would be - and called the ambulance service who in turn alerted the police. Sources told theit is very unlikely Robinson knew about any alleged plans to smuggle migrants into the UK. Police were investigating a suspected Irish people-smuggling ring, the report claimed.  Neighbours told Irish media that Robinsonaposs parents had left their home in Laurelvale, Co Armagh, and had already travelled to England to support their son. Paul Berry, a local councillor who knows the parents, said Robinsonaposs father found out about his sonaposs arrest through social media. The bodies of  men and eight women were discovered inside the container at an industrial estate in Grays in the early hours of Wednesday morning. It is feared they all froze to death inside the trailer where temperatures are said to get as low as -C.  Officers have started the grim job of removing the bodies from the lorry and the painstaking task of trying to identy them. It is believed the stowaways had been inside for more than  hours by the time they were found dead. Police probing one of the UKaposs biggest murder inquiries continued to question Robinson - whose girlfriend is said to be expecting twins - on Thursday. Officers have also raided three properties in Northern Ireland. It is believed Robinson - who called his truck the Polar Express - picked up the trailer two hours before the migrants were found dead.  The trailer had entered England via a freight ferry service from Zeebrugge, Belgium, into Purfleet, Essex, on the River Thames. Belgian authorities said the container arrived at Zeebrugge at .pm local time on Tuesday and left the Belgian port the same afternoon. The ferry docked in Essex just after .am on Wednesday and the lorry left the port in Purfleet about  minutes later. The tractor that hauled it away from the port had come from from Northern Ireland, entering the UK via Holyhead on Sunday on a ferry from Dublin, according to police. It had Ireland emblazoned on the windscreen along with the message The Ultimate Dream.  On social media, Robinson had dubbed his cab the Polar Express. The Bulgarian ministry of foreign affairs said the truck was registered in Varna in Bulgaria under the name of a company owned by an Irish citizen. Paramedics were alerted first after the bodies were discovered at the Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays, and Essex Police were notied just after .am.Police moved the lorry to nearby Tilbury Docks so the bodies could be recovered. Belgiumaposs federal prosecutoraposs office has launched its own investigation to find out where the trailer originated and how long it had been in the country.

Tom Bradby followed their couple on their -day trip to the continent and conducted one-to-one interviews with both of them on hard-hitting issues including mental health and the pressures of royal le.During the hour-long ITV special Harry admitted rumours of a rt between him and brother Prince William were true and Meghan said sheaposs wasnapost okay .Speaking outside Buckingham Palace in an interview for Good Morning America, Tom said: I just told the story that was in front of me really. Anything like this is always story telling as you know, and I went intending to make a documentary that was always going to be about their work in Africa and then a little bit about where they are in le.    I knew that everything wasnapost entirely rosy behind the scenes, thataposs true, but all the same I sort of had intended to turn up probably doing a more conventional journalistic job. I told them before I was going to have to put some particularly pointed questions. But I think the reality I found was just a couple who just seemed a bit bruised and vulnerable. I think with mental health, you have to be very careful what words you use but that was the story I found and it seemed the right journalistic thing to do, to tell that story as empathetically as I could.    You know as well as I do as a journalist, there are dferent moments and that just felt like the approach I should take on this occasion. The documentary has caused a huge debate around the world, with many praising the couple for speaking so honestly about subjects not normally addressed by members of the royal family. But others have criticised them for moaning from such a place of privilege, especially while in a country like South Africa. Insiders claim William and other members of the royal family are extremely worried about Meghan and Harry after seeing the show, adding that the breakdown in the brothersapos relationship was desperately sad.    They said: They’re going completely separate ways and Harry is the one who seems to be visibly struggling. “It seems the boy who walked behind their mother’s coffin, which is so vividly seared onto the nation’s consciousness, has never fully recovered, which is an utter tragedy.

Prince Charles, his sons William and Harry and their wives Camilla, the Duchess of Cambridge and Meghan Markle often sit in the front cars or carriages while those further down the line of success are behind.But according to Prince Edward, the Queenaposs youngest son, there is a huge benefit to this - and he much prefers it.Speaking during a TV interview, he said: Without a shadow of a doubt, one of the best entertainments is being in the car behind the Queen’s car, because that’s where you see all the reactions – especially in places where they’re not expecting to see the Queen , that’s even better.   His we Sophie adds: And we open the window just a little bit, so we can hear what people are saying. Edward also opened up about his first ever royal engagement, saying he was given absolutely no instruction whatsoever of what he actually needed to do. His parents the Queen and Prince Philip walked off ahead, leaving him and his brother Prince Andrew behind. He said: I remember vividly the awful realisation that we were going to have to walk through this corridor of people because the cars – I couldn’t even see the cars, they were around the corner – and our parents just walked off and started talking to people.    And I thought: aposWell, I can either walk down the middle like a complete lemon or…apos I think my brother was there as well, so we just said: aposYou go that side, I’ll go this sideapos, but there was absolutely no instruction whatsoever. I think the only piece of advice I was given was: aposDon’t treat it like a receiving lineapos. So don’t start shaking hands, because once you have shaken one person’s hand you are completely stuck – you have to shake everybody’s hand.    While he avoids shaking hands on walkabouts, the Earl does of course shake hands at official events and while meeting important figures.Despite not being very senior when it comes to the family structure, the Queen is said to be very close to Sophie and enjoys her company. A royal source told the  Sun  that the Monarch will often ask Sophie Wessex to join her in the car on their journey to churchthey are both in Sandringham or Balmoral.The Countess of Wessex is married to Prince Edward, the Queenaposs youngest son, and the couple have two children Lady Louise Windsor and James Viscount Severn. The insider said: The Queen likes to be completely calm before church and she finds Sophie’s presence soothing.    When Sophie married Edward she decided against becoming a working royal, insisting on continuing her work in public relations. The insider added: She is trusted and relied on by the Queen in a way I couldnapost say applied to the Duchess of Cambridge or the Duchess of Cornwall. She is like another daughter to Her Majesty, they are that close.

We often get to see a small selection of her proud collection in one of the reception rooms in Buckingham Palace when she hosts special guests there and shares official photos from the occasion. The photos are often moved around and rearranged, but photos of Princes Charles, William and Harry with their wives are always in pride of place. However in the most recent snap taken in her luxurious living room the photo of Harry and Meghan Markle has vanished from itaposs usual spot. Back when the Monarch met Boris Johnson when he became Prime Minister in July, we could clearly see a shot believed to be from their engagement photoshoot.  However it wasnapost one of the set officially released to celebrate their happy news, so fans were very excited to see the new image. It shows Meghan in a blue dress and normally sits in a simple silver frame. Kate and Williamaposs photo is also from their engagement shoot, and sits just behind in a wooden frame.  Some people have suggested that this may be to protect them after their recent documentary, in which they spoke openly about their struggles with royal le. However itaposs likely to be that the Queen has just rearranged the photos and has decided to put it where, and photos from dferent angles at other events show she has an entire desk of photos directly in her eyeline. She has a piece of paper and her glasses where the photo used to sit, so she might have just decided she needed a bit more free space.    Royal fans love spotting all the photos in the Queenaposs home, but during her meeting with Boris there was something  that really caught their eye .

The  en-suite studio pods measuring just xftwere installed last month in response to an increased demand for student accommodation at University of West of England , in Bristol. But they have been branded Purbeck Court appalling and not mentally viable by students living there - some of whom are moving out after just a month. They also claim have other students in nearby halls of residence taunt them for not living in real accommodation.  Other complaints have included there being limited communal space, thin walls, and being overlooked by an existing hall of residence.And the studio pods are costing residents £ per week - whilst campus accommodation ranges from £ to £ per week. First-year history student Joe Oakes-Monger told the BBC he had decided to move out because it was quite isolating to live in a very confined space. He said: Itaposs a strange place to spend quite a large part of your time in. Thereaposs not really anywhere  to go.    At the time [I moved in] I was desperate for accommodation, but I was pretty appalled. I couldnapost quite believe the prospect of spending a year there.He added it was not an appropriate living standard for a human being. And another student, Jack Field, who writes for the universityaposs student magazine, said he had heard complaints the housing fees were too expensive. The university has said it will be evaluating the value for money of the new units. Mr Field told the BBC: They [the university] say itaposs a pilot scheme but they shouldnapost be testing it on live students. They need to reduce the rent and retroactively refund them.  Also speaking to the BBC, a university spokesperson said the pods had been used successfully where, including student accommodation at other universities. The spokesperson said the flats provided students with the opportunity to live on campus during their first year. We are working closely with the students living in this accommodation to respond to their feedback, they said. This will be used to inform our future accommodation plans and to see whether the pilot may be extended beyond this academic year.The universityaposs vice chancellor, Steve West, has offered to meet with students living in the pods.We are trying to create communities for the increasing number of students who want to live on campus, he said."},{"url":null,"title":"trans woman who sued beauty","story":"NewsTrans woman who sued beauty clinics for refusing to wax her scrotum loses caseTransgender activist Jessica Yaniv filed human rights complaints staff at beauty salons in Canada when they refused to wax her male genitaliaShareByTalia ShadwellMichael Moran:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsTrans woman Jessica Yaniv has lost her case in Canada \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Jessica Yaniv, who identies as female but has male genitalia, had contacted multiple beauty salon businesses in British Columbia, Canada, requesting waxes. A tribunal heard staff refused to perform the pubic hair removal procedure after she revealed she shad a full set of male genitalia.Yaniv filed complaints against multiple beauty salons - claiming the aestheticians’ refusal to wax her scrotum was discriminatory, reports the Daily Star .   But according the tribunalaposs Tuesday decision, Yanivaposs complaint was not genuine. The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal ruled she had gone on a campaign both to enrich herself at the expense of South Asians, and to punish them for what she viewed as transphobia. Now she has been forced to pay the workers over the case- which saw one forced out of business as a result of Yanivaposs claim. The tribunal said Yaniv had had “manufactured the conditions for a human rights complaint” when she demanded bikini waxes from several salons despite still having a full set of male genitalia. A number of the salon workers voiced religious objections to carrying out the procedures. Others said they weren’t appropriately trained in waxing a scrotum. Because some of the salons in question had never offered services to wax anyone’s scrotum, the tribunal said, it could not be said to be discriminating against Ms Yaniv.    The verdict from the tribunal read: Human rights legislation does not require a service provider to wax a type of genitals they are not trained for and have not consented to wax.” Yaniv, the ruling said, “targeted small businesses, manufactured the conditions for a human rights complaint, and then leveraged that complaint to pursue a financial settlement from parties who were unsophisticated and unlikely to mount a proper defence. The evidence Yaniv herself gave was, according to the tribunal, “disingenuous and self-serving”.    Welcoming the verdict Jay Cameron, a lawyer for the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedomswhich represented five of the respondents in Vancouver targeted by Yaniv, said: “Self-identication does not erase physiological reality. The organisation said its clients were women from a erse range of ethnic backgrounds, including two beauty therapists who belonged to the Sikh faith. Most of the women who were the target of Yaniv’s complaints worked from their own home, are immigrants to Canada, do not have English as a first language, and some have small children with them in the house during the day. The JCCF said its clients had refused to provide the service for reasons including a lack of personal comfort, safety concerns, a lack of training, and in some cases religious objections. Cameron said: “Our clients do not offer the service requested. No woman should be compelled to touch male genitals against her will, irrespective of how the owner of the genitals identies.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman almost infertile after contraceptive","story":"NewsWoman almost infertile after contraceptive pill left her with cm tumourTasha Luck believes the huge tumour that grew on her liver is linked to her use of the contraceptive pillShareCommentsByMollie Mansfield:,  OCT NewsTasha Luck started taking the pill all month without a break \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Tasha Luck started to take contraceptive pills when she was -years-old to help with her painful periods, continuing to do so for the next  years. At the beginning she would pop her pills for several weeks at a time before taking a seven-day break in between. In  she read aposnew and unlicensedapos research which suggested she could take her medication for a full month without having an induced period. Four years later, in November , Tasha started to feel physically exhausted, leading her doctor to book her in for a routine blood test.    The results showed that she had abnormal liverand, following ultrasounds and CT scans, the bakery assistant was diagnosed with a massive cm long tumour growing inside her liver. In January  her tumour appeared to start shrink after Tasha stopped taking her contraception. It wasnapost enough to stop her needing a grueling five-hour long surgery to remove the massive growth and half of her liver. Despite doctors worrying the tumour would leave her unable carry a child, they are now confident that Tasha and her husband, Lydon, , will be able to start a family next year.    Tasha told of how she decided to come off the pill after scans showed she had a tumour in her body. Due to the size of the tumour there was a chance of a rupture at any time, so I came off the pill, as the doctors were certain this is what caused it, in hopes that it would shrink my tumour - which it did - but not enough for them to operate, she said. Luckily, I was able to have the surgery last month, September , as I told the hospital I wanted to start a family as soon as possible and the tumour was getting in the way. The surgery removed over half of my liver - it was mostly tumour, but some healthy liver was also removed - and now I am waiting for my scar to heal properly.    Despite the tumour not being cancerous, doctors told Tasha she would not be able to carry a childthe tumour remained inside her. She said: I would be able to conceive but not carry the baby whilst the tumour was in there as the baby would push on it as it grew and it would rupture. Also the pregnancy hormones would begin to feed the tumour so it would start to grow again. I cannot start a family for at least a year due to the location of the scar, but in a way I was aposluckyapos that it was my liver, as it will be busy regenerating and should be fully regrown in six months. I am scheduled for another scan to confirm it has gone, but my surgeon seemed quite confident he had managed to remove it all. For me, itaposs important to share my story because a lot of people know the common side effects of taking the pill but not the massive dangers it can have.

She spent a further three months recovering at the burns unit - and routinely visited the facility for years afterwards, undergoing operations and treatments until she was .Hollie, from West Derby, told the ECHO : I found it really hard at first. I thought I would never have a full and normal le because of my burns.I felt like an alien. I hadnapost seen anyone living with burns like me and I didnapost think anyone  was living with severe burns. Talking about it doesnapost traumatise me now. In the past two years Iaposve come full circle. I wasnapost until I was  years old that I found out that the scars from the burns would be permanent.    I was getting a dressing changed by a nurse and I asked when the scars would go. The nurse and my dad looked at me and they told me that they were only making the scars better and they would always be there. I donapost think anybody realised until then that I didnapost know that the scars were permanent. My dad donated skin to me when I needed a skin graft. Because I was so little I didnapost have enough skin to use my own. They took skin from each of his thighs. Hollieaposs childhood was severely disrupted by her frequent trips to hospital, which also affected her education. She said: It would be hospital for two weeks and then I would be off school for weeks recovering from skin grafts at home.  There was an education team who worked with me while I was in hospital but it was hard to concentrate and my arm was wrapped up so I couldnapost write a lot. Hollie now works at Alder Hey, the hospital where she received most of her treatment, as a Theatre Care Assistant - even working alongside some of the staff who treated her. She said that spending so much time at the burns unit - and the support she received from staff at the hospital - convinced her to pursue a career in healthcare. She said: From a young age I wanted to be a nurse because I wanted to help people, like the people who helped me. But when I left school I didnapost have any qualications. So I thought I wouldnapost be able to it but then a friend told me do some volunteering and then apply to be a Care Assistant. I wanted to feel the satisfaction that they get in their jobs. I want to help others like I was helped for all these years.  I now work with two of the surgeons who operated on me. Itaposs amazing. I never thought Iaposd get to watch an operation and see the exact procedures I had done. The help of the burns unit was so important for me to getting me to the point I am today. You couldnapost ask for better staff. They are one big family and they put so much time and effort into helping me recover. They sat and talked to me. They have given so much support to me and my family. There are still people there that I can go and see today. I wouldnapost be the person I wasit wasnapost for them.

Morgan Geyser and Anissa Weier lured their pal Payton Leutner to a sleepover and then an outdoor play session on May , . Motivated by a fear for the mythical character Slender Man, the two -year-olds then stabbed their friend  times, leaving her for dead as they fled the scene. Thankfully Payton survived the vicious attack, although she has been left with lelong physical and emotional scars. More than five years on from the attack and as Morgan and Anissa serve their  years and  years prison sentences respectively, one of the first police officers on the case has recalled questioning the girls.    Detective Tom Casey sat down with the friends at the Wisconsin police station shortly after the stabbing. I mean, sheaposs at a police department and sheaposs covered in blood and…[itaposs as ] this is like a normal day for her, he said of Morgan in an ABC   programme. When the detective asked the girls whether Payton was dead or alive, they didnapost seem concerned about her condition. I might as well just say it. We were trying to kill her, Morgan said, Detective Casey recalled. I figured that Iaposd get into trouble eventually, though, because mommy always says that whatever you do catches up to you eventually, and it did.    Anissa went on to tell Detective Michelle Trussoni how she had become afraid of Slender Man - a tall, suited character without a face - through a website that collects horror stories. She became convinced the ghostly figure was real after seeing him, she believed, while on a bus ride. The girl told Detective Trussoni that it was really scary to think that Slender Man could kill her whole family in three seconds. All pupils at the same school, Morgan and Anissa thought they had come up with the plan for the perfect murder.    They had invited Payton to a sleepover and originally planned to stab her that night - but couldnapost go through with it.

After playing for some time, they started a game of hide and seek and when Payton was crouching down, they pounced. She was pinned down and as she stabbed her friend multiple times in a frenzied attack, Geyser shouted: Don’t be afraid. I’m only a little kitty cat. Before the girls fled the scene they told Payton they were going to get help. In her police interview Anissa said: So, we told her we we’re gonna get help, but we really weren’t.

The Green Party are worried controversial Hamburg centre Laboratory of Phramacology and Toxicology could have been relocated - and are continuing to test the animals where in an attempt to dodge investigators.Last weekaposs horrying footage of monkeys screaming in pain inside a laboratory prompted calls for an urgent change to EU laws. The distressing video was released by animal rights activists and it sparked worldwide outrage. It also shows cats and dogs that appear to be bleeding and even dying after undergoing cruel tests.   Now the Green Party says they have been tipped off that testing has not been halted.Local Green Party politician Christiane Blomeke said: Animal activists have reported to us that dogs and monkeys have been transported where.MirrorOnline have approached the Laboratory of Phramacology and Toxicology for comment. Authorities are not aware of the animals being moved to a new location but a spokesman for the local authorities investigating said: In theory, the animals can be moved without any specic ruling.LPT must now inform us in advancethey plan to kill animals, this should prevent animals being killed in large numbers and cover-ups of the animals being killed.    LPT also has to inform usan animal leaves the LPT lab. The video was secretly shot inside Laboratory of Phramacology and Toxicologyin Hamburg, by an undercover worker from organisations Soko Tierschutz and Cruelty Free International I. The monkeys are seen crying like newborn babies while they hang from metal harnesses strapped to their necks.    Friedrich Mülln from Soko Tierschutz said: The animals were even still waggling their tails when they were being taken to be killed, the dogs were desperate for human contact. The worst treatment was kept for the monkeys. The macaques breed of monkeys are small, relatively light primates, which are often used for animal experiments at LPT. They are kept in cramped conditions in small cages. Many of the animals have developed compulsive tendencies and are seen going round in circles.

as Brett Stovin was on hand to turn in the rebound of Jagger Dirk’s blocked shot.Pacha’s men were on top for most of the second session and, in the third, Stars closed in again.While on the powerplay, Dundee’s Elgin Pearce pulled one back to make it - on  minutes.The Canadian forward was in space and picked out by Anthony Beauregard before he released a quick shot that flew past Duba and deflected down off the crossbar.The Tayside team were only within one goal of the Steelmen for five minutes as Sheffield restored their two-goal lead after  minutes.Steelers’ Eric Meland released a fast and low shot that hit the leg of Eberle and that was enough to deflect the puck past Leclerc, making it -.Despite Dundee going all out in the final few minutes, the home side held on to claim a - home win.Dundee’s next matches see them face another tough test with a trip to Belfast Giants on Friday night before a home clash against Glasgow Clan on Saturday."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey -

to Russia in Moscow and beat San Marino - at Hampden in Euro  qualying Group I.To make his Dark Blue bow was a boost, as he had come so close in the past.Reds boss McInnes was thrilled to see Devlin finally win caps for Scotland and hopes his stopper can add to them and establish himself with the national team in the same way as McKenna, his Pittodrie colleague.McKenna missed out on the last squad, having just ed from a hamstring injury, but having made his debut in March of last year, the -year-old has gone on to win  caps and become a mainstay of the Scotland defence.McInnes said of Devlin’s first two Scotland appearances: “It was two games that were in total contrast to each other.“Steve had indicated in conversations with me that he was going to cap Mikey.“It was a dficult start for him against Russia. The team had to pick themselves up from the disappointment when the game ended.“There was the high of getting his first cap, but then the disappointment of how it turned out.“However, the reaction was good from everyone, including Mikey, against San Marino.“I’m sure that lted Mikey, but it also lted the supporters of the Scotland team.“So it was good that Mikey had a convincing win and it was good he got the opportunity to go back into the team again after losing against Russia.“Certainly he came back in last Tuesday feeling good about himself and rightly so.“To get a couple of caps is great and he will see it now as a chance to establish himself in the national team in the way McKenna has done.”Former Hamilton Accies man Devlin was named in Clarke’s previous two squads, in September and June, but didn’t feature in two clashes against Belgium and encounters with Russia and Cyprus.Last season, after a bright start to the campaign with Aberdeen, he looked set to be handed his Scots debut by Gothenburg Great Alex McLeish in the Uefa Nations League double header with Albania and Israel in November.However, a foot injury sustained during training with the national team meant he missed out.That injury ended up keeping Devlin out for three months last season and after he ed to action with the Dons he struggled to recapture his early-season form.McInnes added: “He got injured away with Scotland and after that he really struggled to get any momentum again.“Mikey is someone who is hungry to get more caps and I’m sure the two caps he’s had will help that in terms of trying to get into future squads.”Devlin’s two caps were contrasting encounters.In the first, against Russia, he was up against prolic Zenit St Petersburg striker Artem Dzyuba, who scored twice as Russia thrashed the Scots -.But three days later, at Hampden, Devlin was rarely tested defensively against minnows San Marino.McInnes believes Devlin will feel the benefit of both games in his future development.He said: “Whether you see it immediately or not, I think you always get a benefit from playing with your national team.“Whether it’s a good experience or a bad experience, I think it makes you better.“He’s had to play against Russia and be asked the question a lot by a physical striker and then play against a team in San Marino where he didn’t have a lot to do defensively.“It was more about his use of the ball, which was good, as was his concentration. Mikey has sampled two dferent ends of the spectrum in international football and it’s pleasing he managed to deal with that.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/10/EE-KF-141019-01-02-450x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet lexi lola and harley are looking for a new home can you help1","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home. vw, px\"  This sweet girl is nine years old.She’s a friendly pup, but being a little older she doesn’t want to live with young children or other dogs or cats.Lexi loves playing with her toys, especially footballs!

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate. We are asking adults to step up alongside us and make this a turning point in our history.#Greta Thunberg was welcomed by the Speaker of the House of Commons, the leader of the Labour Party and the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. She also spoke at the elite gathering of business leaders in Davos and at the UN.In March , school strikes took place in more than , cities around the world. Again in May, in more than  countries, millions of pupils took to the streets to remind the world that the earth faces a climate emergency.The strike starting on September  coincides with the UN Climate Action Summit in New York. Millions of people in more than  countries will walk out of their work, homes and colleges and spend a day demanding action on the climate emergency.I hear that many in Lochgilphead High School are planning to do the same # well done!Let us join them on Friday September  between am and pm to help build a future fit for all living beings.Mary Stirling, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"getting karate kicks at kilmory beach","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMembers of IKKU Kyokushinkai Karate clubs in Lochgilphead, Oban and Perth met at Kilmory beach on Saturday August  for their annual beachEveryone who attended had a great time and the weather was kind.The training consisted of fitness, basic techniques and self defence."},{"url":null,"title":"lets get the funk out at mojo","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowContinuing our introductions to the fine original acts from Argyll at this year#s MOJO festival, the next band to be highlighted is a cool and lively eight-piece funk group from Ardfern.Formed in November  with a real intent to boogie, Ardfunk have been playing covers of songs by some of their favourite idols like Aretha Franklin, James Brown and Toots and the Maytals at parties # and they ave gone down a storm with their soul, jazz and RB fusions of funk and reggae flavours.Not content with simply playing covers, the band have taken on the challenge and got the taste for writing their own slick material to perform.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction.

The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood. Swtly moving onto Strauss and Mahler the audience were given songs of simple love, a sing off between a cuckoo and a nightingale and a man in great pain which reigned the audience in with a spiritual lull.The second half opened with a stunning rendition of Faure’s #Apres Un Reve#. Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness. It was aAs a light and fun ending we were given #I can be a sexy lady#, a piece about poor mezzos and how they always play boys and not much  in operas. I highly recommend you Youtube it for a bit of light entertainment.The partnership between the two is one I have not seen all that often and you can tell that they really enjoy working together."},{"url":null,"title":"september festival fun for soccer kids","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowIt was a busy September for kids from Red Star youths, with teams attending festivals at Haldaneand Lochnell thanks to sponsorship from Ardrishaig Community Trust and Ventient Energy A’Chruach Community Fund.Almost  kids headed off to Alexandria in early September for the popular and competitive Haldane festival playing against new teams from across the West of Scotland.Lochgilphead were represented by teams at , ,  and  age groups with each working hard and testing themselves against some really good teams.

John Kennedy played the ball between the penalty spot and the D where Allan MacDonald let the ball run across his body before turning and blasting home, giving Cameron Sutherland no chance in the Oban goal.There were harsh words in the Oban Camanachd dressing room at half-time and revamp saw Keith MacMillan replace Gary McKerracher whilst the forward line switched to a three-one formation with Andrew MacCuish on the D.The switches paid idends when the home side drew level just four minutes into the second half when Daniel MacCuish ran forward and Daniel MacVicar volleyed the ball into the net to make it -.Oban Camanachd took the lead on  minutes when Andrew MacCuish’s turn and shot flew past the keeper.Just a couple of minutes later, Andrew MacCuish turned provider as he found Scott MacMillan who finished with a low drive from the left although his effort may have taken a slight deflection.Two of the game’s best young goalkeepers were on show, and Inveraray’s Scott MacLachlan saved his side from a bigger defeat though Oban Camanachd did have to rely on Cameron Sutherland who made good saves near the end from Garry MacPherson and Allan MacDonald.The win for Oban Camanachd means that they and Kyles are the only sides, other than championship favourites Kingussie, in the title race as the season moves into the closing stages."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 11 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowACHA tenantIt has been a while since we carried a story where a tenant has a complaint about a housing association property.

a -year contract worth pound million - were also raised by auditors.While the report identies the delays and issues which plagued customer access of the councils online services, auditors said it was too soon to gauge the impact of iPads taking over more traditional teaching methods in Borders schools from this year.And the methodology of farming out senior staff, such as the Executive Director for Commercial Activity spending four days of his week as managing director of the failed SB Cares, and the Executive Director for Strategic Partnerships seconded to the South of Scotland Enterprise Agency three days each week, was also questioned.The report stated: \"While this is a positive and innovative approach aimed at realising the councils wider ambitions, it must continue to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to deliver local services.\"But, perhaps, coming in for the most criticism was the current culture of secrecy and the need for better communication and engagement with staff, councillors and the public.The report stated: \"The council should be more effective in evaluating, managing and reporting its performance, bringing greater clarity on where and how its services need to improve.\"It also needs to get better at the reporting of performance - both in terms of information considered by members and in reporting to the public.\"Budgeting at the local authority, though, was applauded by auditors.And, during extremely dficult economic times, the managing to maintain its usable reserves in case of emergencies was also identied.Although Audit Scotland identied further development was needed for the ambitious Fit for  mid-term savings plan, which aims to trim pound. million from budgets by , the report is complimentary of cost cutting to date.The report stated: \"The council has a good record of achieving savings and has reflected the impact of demographic change on demands for services and pay increases for staff, in its financial plans.\"However, in common with all other councils, the financial outlook remains a signicant challenge.\"Council chief executive Tracey Logan welcomed the detailed analysis of her local authority.And she admitted many of the problems in the Audit Scotland report are already being tackled.She told us: \"We will take on board Audit Scotlandrsquos feedback and recommendations, many of which we had already identied ourselves and are taking action on, and continue to drive forward transformational change across all our services through our Fit for  programme.,params: .pushldquoFor example, we are already actively working with NHS Borders to improve joint working, and we also recognise that we need to do more to respond to the Community Empowerment Act in order to encourage and enable people to play their part more easily in their communities.ldquoA key priority for us going forward will be to improve our performance monitoring and measurement to demonstrate on a regular basis that the councilrsquos services are continuing to meet best value and identy quickly areas where further improvements are needed.\"Looking after our most vulnerable people and giving our children the best start in le are key priorities for the council and we are justiably proud of our track record across these areas.ldquoHowever, the report recognises that as a small rural authority covering a huge geographical area we face many challenges in order to improve and sustain high performance across all our service areas.\""},{"url":null,"title":"letter independence march","story":"I didn#t march because my aged legs don#t carry me far these days, but I#m not ashamed to be a supporter of independence.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box.

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope.

Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties.

And the decision has brought angryreaction from the local community, who opposed the substation plans in the first place but were overruled by the Scottish Government.Scottish Ministers called in the substation plans after ruling the project to be of ldquonational importance last year, taking the decision out of the hands of East Lothian Council, the planning authority.Despite local representations opposing the substation, Scottish Ministers gave it the go-ahead in February amid claims it was necessary to move quickly to meet the deadline for the UK Government funding.But the UK Government announced its grants late last month and ICOL was not included in the list of successful projects, leaving the firm to rethink its future.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray said it appeared Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to ldquoride roughshod over local feeling ldquomight all have been for nothing.The former power station site was bought by the council last year and the local authority is marketing the land for economic development.However, the council was forced to reach an agreement with ICOL over a section of the site after the Scottish Government gave the substation the go-ahead.Mr Gray said: ldquoThe immediacy of the UK Government funding decision was the Scottish Governmentrsquos justication for riding roughshod over local decision-making and calling in the substation application in the first place.ldquoI opposed that decision to call in the application as unnecessary and anti-democratic and made the case for it being left in the hands of local people and their representatives.ldquoHowever, having put the local community through such uncertainty, it now appears that the Ministerrsquos heavy-handed interference in the sitersquos future might all have been for nothing.

the work is done.Until then, a section of the north side of the road is closed and traffic lights in place, leading to delays for motorists.Michael Owens, of the Coal Authorityrsquos public safety and subsidence team, said the programme to remediate the shaft would start once all the necessary permissions and utility works had taken place.He added: ldquoA full design has been carried out by Coal Authority engineers and given the highly technical and planning nature of this project, AECOM, an engineering consultancy firm, have been appointed by us to oversee the project works.ldquoWe are also in discussions with the utility company SGN, who need to isolate and ert the medium pressure gas main that runs under the road before our work can start.ldquoSGN have indicated that the lead-in time for their work could be up to  weeks but we are in discussions with them and are waiting for confirmation of their start date.ldquoThis is of central importance to the appointed contractorrsquos

Council has complained to the Coal Authority about theof time spent on the project.DJ Johnston-Smith, community councillor, said there was ldquohuge frustration, especially among the nearby residents.ldquoLiving as we do on top of almost a thousand years of coal-mining activities, everyone accepts that such subsidence activities are likely to occur from time to time, but in this instance, the Coal Authority appears to have taken an overly excessive amount of time to meet its responsibilities, he said.ldquoHaving known about complications caused by an adjacent listed wall, some nearby protected trees and the neighbouring gas main, the Coal Authority appears to have singularly failed to address each of these all at once, a failure further compounded by their poor communication to the town of progress in dealing with the sinkhole.ldquoLocal residents simply wish for a speedy conclusion to this issue, which has undoubtedly caused alarm to those whose houses

What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children. It can promote critical thinking, encourage the observation of the world around us, help language development and can be a powerful bonding process with your child. And itrsquos fun!And so when next time you are with your kids, grandchildren, nieces or nephews and find yourself waiting for food to be delivered in a restaurant or have no time for a proper bedtime story, or you just want to spend some quality time together without a screen, try make riddling part of it. Trust me, it will be fun.Oh, and the answer to the well-known riddle at the beginning  Itrsquos a coffin."},{"url":null,"title":"positives-negatives-plans-haddington-town-centre-says-group","story":"Proposals were revealed by the Courier last month that would see a complete revamp of Haddington town centre.Dozens of spaces could be removed from High Street and Market Street, with the introduction of cycle lanes, wider footpaths and a communal space on High Street.The proposals have been met with concern by businesses in the town centre, who fear that the removal of up to  spaces ndash and the introduction of a car park of more than  spaces on Whittingehame Drive ndash could have a negative impact on their way of le.Haddington and District Community Council heard from both Haddington Business Community Partnershipand residents last Tuesday before asking non-community councillors, including the Courier, to leave to discuss the proposals in private.Now, a sub-group ndash made up of community councillors Jan Wilson , Fiona McEwan , Paul Darling , Pat Lemmon and Jack Worden ndash is to meet to draft a letter to East Lothian Council outlining concerns and any positives regarding the scheme.Mrs Lemmon said: ldquoAll community councillors managed to finally see the draft plan that has already been submitted to Sustrans.ldquoThere are some positives but there are also negatives.ldquoSo the community council has formed a sub-group, which is meeting on Tuesday to draft a letter to East Lothian Council. It is felt at the moment that the draft in its entirety is not acceptable until this letter is lodged and any concerns we have are taken on board.ldquoNot everybody understood everything that was involved in the draft plan but time was needed to make sure not only all the community councillors were more familiar with the draft plan but we had heard from HBCP and Haddington residents.ldquoIt was felt in the past that at community council meetings not enough time had been dedicated to it, hence the reason why Tuesday night happened.When the controversial proposals were revealed, the local authority confirmed it was ldquoexploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.The new lsquoedge of centrersquo car park, dubbed a park and stride or a park and ride, would encourage people to walk or be bussed from Whittingehame Drive back into the town centre.No location has been confirmed for any new car park, although there have been concerns raised as to how it would impact upon community events such as Nungate Gala and the townrsquos fireworks.The long-stay car park at the townrsquos Tesco store, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could also become a short-stay car park.Joanna Gibson, HBCP chairwoman, outlined the grouprsquos feelings about the proposed scheme before non-community councillors were asked to leave the meeting ndash a decision that, according to East Lothian Council, was entirely down to the community council.A number of businesses feared they would not be able to operate through a y construction period.

This includes improved pedestrian and cycle access, as well as exploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.ldquoOur priorities are to protect and enhance the local environment while supporting the local economy.

When askedthere was a new Scottish independence referendum tomorrow should Scotland stay in the UK, .% said Remain, with .% plumping for Leave with around % either undecided or refused to register a decision.Last week, Scotlands first minister insisted that a legal referendum is the only way for the country to win independence.She dismissed claims that the SNP winning a majority of Scottish seats in a general election would be enough for independence to be declared.There was \"no easy or shortcut route to independence\" and that a future referendum had to be \"beyond any doubt in terms of its legitimacy\".:Ian Blackford says Scottish independence vote has to happen next yearBut she insisted that independence was now closer than ever.She has repeatedly said she wants to hold a second referendum on independence next year - but the move has been ruled out by the UK government.The latest Survation poll of , people aged over  in Scotland also revealed some % agree that Brexit makes independence more likely - showing no change from March.When Scots were askedthe UK leaves the EU without a deal, would they be more likely to vote for independence in a future referendum, % agreed in that latest poll, up from % in March.According to the latest poll, more than half of Scotsthink there will be another vote on independence within the next two years -arise from the % who believed that in March.The Survation polls on support or otherwise for Scottish independence for Progress Scotland did not seek a straight Remain or Leave option. Instead, voters were asked to provide a depth of feeling about independence or staying part of the Union using a scale from zero to ten.The analysisfalls more in line with the Panelbase survey for The Sunday Times Scotland which last weekfound support for Scottish independence had risen to %.The % figure backing independence marks a five point increase on the % Panelbase registered on average in its polls last year, which mirrored the % yes % no result of the  independence referendum.Angus Robertson, the former leader of the SNPs Westminister group in Parliament, who is the managing director of Progress Scotland, said after some of thelatestpoll results were producedon its website: ldquoThese poll results show that Brexit is having a major impact on general public opinion on the timing of a second independence referendum, and particularly on swing voters who are open-minded or undecided on Scottish independence.ldquoA clear majority believe that Brexit makes Scottish independence more likely and that their views have changed about Scottish independence.\"The Press Association previously reported that the Progress Scotland poll showed that Scots are \"more likely to have shted towards remaining part of the UK rather than backing Scottish independence\".Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins had said when the original figures - that came without the March comparisons - were revealed: \"Its no wonder these independence campaigners want to keep the results of this poll quiet.\"Progress Scotland arent usually slow to trumpet their findings so its interesting that theyve been so secretive about this particular survey.\"Like the vast majority of polls, it reveals again that more Scots want to remain in the UK than to leave it.\"And, far from gaining momentum, it seems the Yes campaign is losing supporters at a higher rate than its gaining them.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  A happy day for equality  but a sad day for the Union","story":"The reason for breaking the shameful deadlock that has put democracy on hold for three years was not to pick up business where they left off, nor to attempt to bridge the irreconcilable gulf between warring parties, but to block one of the most signicant pieces of legislation to be passed in Belfast in years.Pro-choice campaigners, and hundreds of thousands of women across the country, won a victory on Monday.

The disease caused the deaths of thousands due to their failure of businesses to provide adequate on-site protection from a deadly substance which moved into the home by way of dirty overalls, also killing the women who washed them.The play focuses on Jack, a would-be comedian who survived the workersrsquo occupation of the Glasgow shipyards, only to be sentenced, as he puts it, to another decade exposed to asbestos. His we Beanie gave up here ambitions to wash up after Jack, only for all her dreams to be left hung out to dry by her labours.Their daughter, Lucy, meanwhile, has dirty laundry of her own to deal with, as well as her boss in the fibre optics company where she works. Through these four criss-crossing lives is woven a thread of everyday tragedy that spans the generations in its sad legacy.It would have been easy for Poet to punch this final contribution to the Citizens Theatre companyrsquos Citizens Women season this year into a tub-thumping polemic. But this is a more complex affair that largely unfolds in Jemima Levickrsquos elegiac production through a series of cut-up monologues.Suzanne Magowanrsquos Lucy only communicates with her parents through a fitful dream-state, while they only seem to come fully together after death. It is Lucyrsquos relationship with Ali Craigrsquos Pete that brings her back down to earth.The result of this co-production with the Stellar Quines company is an intriguing hybrid of social commentary, sit-com and ghost play. This is led by a pair of moving and seriously funny performances by Jonathan Watson as Jack and Maureen Carr as Beanie.

Especially as he was carrying a banner telling the commuters they were complicit in the climate crisis by simply working.It is hard to argue against the message Extinction Rebellion are trying to get across, but they need to learn a bit of self-awareness to get the public on board.Extinction Rebellionsrsquo official Twitter feed during the London protests claimed their fight is the same as that of Rosa Parks, the US civil rights campaigner who refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white person. Crass and misinformed doesnrsquot even cover it.Ordinary folk donrsquot like being lectured to by middle-aged hipsters in pixie boots and Tweed on anything, and certainly not from the roof of a delayed commuter train.Teenage climate change activists are far better at getting their message across as they are less offensive and donrsquot appear to be hypocrites.

By contrast, the current leaders seemed a bit like last years heated up and served without much enthusiasm.Ian Blackford is caught up trying to manoeuvre the debates in Westminster and seems to be somewhat eclipsed by Ms Cherry at the moment.Why would the SNP risk a leadership battle when the prize of an independence referendum might be so close Nicola Sturgeon has steered the SNP into setting a window of dates when she insists Scotland must have an independence referendum. Later events have undermined the wisdom of these dates even as they have increased the chance of achieving the prize.To win a referendum this time next year the SNP would have to switch from talking about how bad Brexit is and will be and start talking about what would change under independence.Those who would be persuaded by rhetoric, anti-Tory, anti-Boris sentiment have already been persuaded. Those whose homes, jobs, benefits, health or welfare services have been hurt by Brexit will not want to risk things getting worse ndash they will want detail and plans. The SNP cannot provide a case for Scotland leaving the UK.This is not down to the competence or skills of the SNP but down to the simple fact that the whole UK economy will be in the midst of a huge change. There wold be no stable baseline to start from because so much will be dependent on negotiations taking place or deals being finalised.Campaigning at that time for Scotland to leave the UK would be an uphill battle with the very real chance of severe economic upheaval should they succeed.Ms Sturgeon has used up her \"resets\" for the timetable to independence. The SNP membership and the wider Yes movement are already frustrated by her preication. The only way out of this dilemma is for the SNP to replace Ms Sturgeon with a new leader who can clear the decks and build anew.Michael Kent, Gfnock.DAVID J Crawfords letterbrought a smile to my face.

Where  In his own head presumably.Jim Mitchell, Carluke.WHEN Boris Johnson said in the House of Commons that the Scottish Parliament has no say on Brexit issues, despite the fact that legislative consent is required in respect of devolved issues, it sums up the UK Establishmentrsquos lack of respect for Scotland.Far from Brexit being a piece of cake compared to independence negotiations, any future orce talks between the UK and an independent Scotland would focus on very dferent set of issues than Brexit as there would be no equivalent to the Northern Irish backstop issue and the continuation of the Common Travel Areawith Ireland under the Brexit deal suggests that would also continue in the case of an independent Scotland.Beginning with the United States, a total of  countries have left London rule and only three have ever voted to stay: Northern Ireland in , Bermuda in  and Scotland in . None of those who left Westminster rule, including Malta, which has more say over Brexit than Scotland, has ever asked toor regretted leaving and most have prospered, as do all the small self-governing nations in western Europe.Mary Thomas, Edinburgh EH.I WAS a little surprised to read that there was consideration given to recalling the Scottish Parliament from its autumn recess to discuss the Brexit crisis .I didnrsquot realise they were on holiday considering they had just ed from their summer holidays in September. They managed a mere five weeks before they felt the need of another break.By Jove, they were up in arms about Westminster proroguing but they donrsquot need to bother with that there is always another holiday round the corner.Considering the state of education, the NHS, and the economy, not to mention Brexit, you would think  weeks annual vacation is grossly excessive, especially when you consider that most normal folk have to do with four or five weeks.I keep reading about politicians needing more respect.

The blurring of sexual demarcation lines has long offered young eyes, often visiting a theatre for the first time, the awareness that anybody can play anybody who can fall in love with anyone.Yet,males are removed from the line-up the fear is panto becomes less about the battle between Good versus Evil, about love conquering all, and more about tick-box sexual politics.Panto queen Elaine C. Smith however reckons the removal of the Y chromosome from the line up to be immensely positive ldquoConsidering the only picture for a century or more has been of menin panto then itrsquos a great way to balance things. Edinburgh is all-male as ever, Aberdeen, again men led, and across the UK not much has changed. Itrsquos generally men who are musical directors, and writing, directing and designing pantos.Itrsquos perhaps no surprise the progressive Tron Theatre has moved in this direction. Writer director performer Johnny McKnightrsquos previous panto Mother Goose featured a same sex love story, and it was not only appropriate for the times, it was a very funny panto. Last year, an all-female cast enjoyed a runaway success with the fabulous Pride and Prejudice , featuring five females wearing frocks and Doc Martins and sometimes moustaches. Yet, Austenrsquos story was one of the battle of the sexes, exploring the very dferent sensibilities. And the Tron conceit of a woman, for example, playing a wet-shirted, stuff-shirted Darcy, offered huge comedic value.But panto isnrsquot nearly so complex. What we all want is Aladdin to get the better of Abanazar and get off with the Princess , or for Cinders to show her sisters therersquos no point in cutting off your toes to spite your face.Yet, therersquos another question thrown up by the move to remove men. If male actors donrsquot get the chance to play Uglies, is this a de facto political statement saying itrsquos now wrong to laugh at a butch man in a dress  Is Dick Emery dead to us The Tronrsquos version of the Uglies will see two women play daft men instead. That may be funny, but consider this: panto has long been moving away from the Principal Boy being played by a women, with some feminist groups saying the character objecties women.Butthe new Cinderella sees women send up masculinity, is this not equally wrong And had this all-female casting policy been around in the past fty years we would have been denied the drag talents of the likes of Stanley Baxter, Rikki Fulton and Jack Milroyand Johnny Beattie. Wersquod have shut the door to the great campery of performers such as Gerard Kelly, Allan Stewart and John Barrowman.And what of the future  If we become too positive in our discrimination are we denying a Frankie Boyle or a Kevin Bridges, should they fancy,a stint in a frock Whatrsquos undeniable is any professional theatre which announced an all-male panto cast would be bombarded with something heavier than fake custard pies.There is little doubt the Tron panto has an excellent line-up in the likes of Sally Reid, Hannah Jarrett-Scottand Jo Freer. There is little doubt Johnny McKnight is an exceptionally clever writer. But Irsquod rather he was putting on the lip gloss and appearing alongside the great line-up of women.

These bus services are described as “commercial”.Local authorities such as Aberdeenshire Council have a duty to identy travel needs within their area which are not otherwise met, and secure what public transport is appropriate taking into account the funds available. These bus services are described as “supported”.In addition to funding fixed route bus services, the council supports community transport, for example dial-a-bus and voluntary car schemes operated by the voluntary sector, provides door-to-door dial-a-bus services and also provides a TaxiCard Scheme which offers a discount on taxi fares, usually £ per journey, for older and disabled residents.Chair of the council’s Infrastructure Services Committee, Councillor Peter Argyle, said: “It was agreed earlier this year that the network should be reassessed by means of a ‘clean-sheet’ approach, in order to identy a more sustainable network in the longer term that will more effectively cater for otherwise unmet travel needs, assist in addressing patronage decline and provide better value for money.“I would encourage all those who currently use bus services or may require them in the future to complete this quick survey which will provide vital information for our wider consultation.”Vice-chair Councillor John Cox added: “In addition to getting the views of residents, our survey is being issued to a wide range of organisations including community councils, rural partnerships, schools and social care facilities.“That feedback will assist us in developing cost-effective, fit-for-purpose services for Aberdeenshire communities in the years to come.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fraserburghherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Here are  of the strangest UK parking laws to be aware of to ensure you avoid being fined by authorities\"   of the strangest UK parking laws viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Further information on the council’s strategy and associated current policies for the support of passenger transport including local bus services, can be found in the Passenger Transport Strategy https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk media  passengertransportstrategy.pdfThe questionnaire will be available online from Monday, October  to Monday, December  at https:www.aberdeenshire.gov.uk roads-and-travel public-transport policies-strategies-and-contracts Printed copies being available in local libraries, Aberdeenshire Council offices, Ellon Park  Ride, and Peterhead Interchange, with effect from November ."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"October ,  at : pmA community-led scheme to turn a disused schoolhouse into affordable rented housing in North Ronaldsay has been named as a finalist in a national competition.

The new agreement has been criticised by commentators for undermining the links between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Speaking in the house yesterday, Mr Carmichael asked: “The creation of a customs border down the Irish Sea and the necessary declarations as a consequence of that is something about which Ruth Davidson and the former Secretary of State for Scotland warned last year.#They said then, and it’s true now, that it will undermine the Union. Why is the Secretary of State disregarding his Rt Hon Friend’s advice ”Responding in the house, the secretary of state said: “This is a deal that protects the border, this was a key priority for me as Secretary of State. It protects the peace process. The economy of Northern Ireland, I think, will benefit from this deal . . . and I would work over the implementation period to minimise any problems for Northern Ireland businesses in exporting and selling into Great Britain.”Responding after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said: “The Secretary of State’s response was muddled and confused. It shows once again that the Conservative Party is now so fixated with Brexit that it is blind to the damage that they risk doing to the constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom. The lack of concern shown by the Government about this issue is deeply concerning.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Maritime art will also be explored in more detail in each island including the possibility of creating an art exhibition or trail that is inspired by the maritime nature of the isles.   Andy Golightly, programme manager for the North Isles Landscape Partnership said: “If people get involved in this project as well as the opportunity to find out more about maritime history and perhaps add to the existing research there will be the chance to learn new and interesting skills including surveying, mapping and even expanding their creative and artistic abilities too”     Natalia Bain from Wessex Archaeology added: “We have arranged a series of information events across isles so people can find out more about the project, the opportunities for involvement and what they would like to research.” Information sessions about the project will be held throughout next week. This includes events at Sanday Community School on Monday, October  Westray Junior High on Tuesday, October  St Ann#s Community Room in Papa Westray on Wednesday, October  Eday Heritage Centre on Thursday, October  North Ronaldsay Community Centre on Friday, November  and at the Boathouse in Shapinsay on Saturday, November .Dates in Stronsay and Rousay, Eglisay and Wyre are to be confirmed.For further information, you can contact the North Isles Landscape Partnership Scheme via its Facebook Page.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This further three month delay is the last thing communities in Orkney and Shetland needed, given the ongoing uncertainty it creates.“It seems that every time Ministers make an announcement the deadline for the new contract gets pushed back. This latest delay is blamed on concerns raised by the European Commission. Given the regular dialogue between the Scottish Government and the Commission over the past year, it beggars belief that Ministers should have been caught out in this way.“Meanwhile, businesses and communities in Orkney and Shetland are left wondering when they will ever get clarity over the future of these leline ferry services.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Orkney currently outranks every other Scottish partnership in eight out of nine of these indicators.Sally Shaw, chief officer for Orkney Health and Care, said: #In undertaking the activities set out in this plan and the developing Strategic Commissioning Implementation Plan, we are determined to use all available community assets and also to ensure our third sector colleagues become equal partners.  Equal does not just mean sitting at the same table, it means having an equal say in how, what and when we commission, amongst other things.#We also seek to ensure that we break down hierarchy and other barriers that hinder our staff in their day to day work. We want to develop imagination, innovation and a culture where staff feel engaged, enabled and are part of a learning organisation.  We see this as essential for driving forward what will be a ‘health and social care revolution’ here in Orkney.#The plan is available on Orkney Islands Council’s website # https:www.orkney.gov.uk Service-Directory S ohac-strategic-commissioning-plan.htmcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Tory chairman James Cleverly insisted Brexit could still happen on October , telling BBC Radio rsquos Today programme: ldquoThe EU has not agreed an extension and therefore it is absolutely essential that we make sure that we are ready to leave.Mr Johnson will chair a meeting of his political Cabinet ndash without civil servants ndash on Thursday afternoon. It is thought discussion of an election is likely to be on the agenda. There are fears among Conservatives thatthere is an election before the UK has left the EU, it will play into the hands of Nigel Faragersquos Brexit Party.EvenMr Johnson does decide to press for an early election, there is no guarantee that he will succeed. -- vw,vw,px, px\"The PMrsquos chief adviser Dominic Cummings is said to be leading the push for an early election--Under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act he would need a ldquosuper majority of two-thirds of all MPs to call an election which would require Labour support.Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour is ready to go to the country once it is sure Mr Johnson cannot ldquocrash out in a no-deal Brexit in the middle of a campaign.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell, however, said Labour is prepared for an election before Christmas ldquo necessary.ldquoWersquore hoping, step by step, hoping we can get some agreement with the Government hellip If we canrsquot, wersquore up for an election for whenever it comes, and wersquore confident, he told ITVrsquos Peston programme.But that stance appears to be at odds with the fact there iswidespread opposition to an election among the partyrsquos MPs at a time when they are trailing in the polls. -- vw,vw,px, px\" --Any decision is likely to wait until Friday when EU leaders are expected to decide whether, and for how long, there should be another Brexit delay.It is widely thought they will agree a so-called ldquoflextension to the end of January, with the option for the UK to leave before thenthere is agreement in Parliament on a deal.If leaders cannot come to an agreement, it could mean there will have to be an EU emergency summit, probably on Monday, just three days before the UK is currently due to leave.It follows reports that French President Emmanuel Macron is keen to press for a short extension of  days. A shorter extension would be a boost to Mr Johnson, who has told outgoing European Council president Donald Tusk that he does not want any further delay.copy -.

It’s a recurring theme: once parliamentarians actually know what it is they’re being asked to vote for, they’re suddenly less enthusiastic.The cruellest irony is that the architect of Mr Johnson’s humiliation – Sir Oliver, who was thrown out of the parliamentary Conservative Party for rebelling to stop a no-deal Brexit – voted with the government.But Mr Johnson lost the second vote on the timetable for the legislation because MPs didn’t trust his commitments on workers rights and environmental protections, and wouldn’t tolerate sending the bill on a break-neck, two day sprint through the Commons.A signicant delayThe result is that a signicant delay is all but guaranteed, and a winter election seems inevitable. Once the Letwin amendment was passed, Mr Johnson was forced to ask for a delay until at least  January under the terms of the Benn Act. His petulant gesture of sending one unsigned letter, and two more saying he didn’t want a delay, gave Downing Street the headlines it wanted but had no practical impact.Likewise, appeals from Brexiteers for EU leaders to veto an extension have been ignored. Viktor Orban, the Eurosceptic strongman prime minister of Hungary, and French President Emmanuel Macron, whose frustration at the endlessness of Brexit distraction for Europe, were touted as leading candidates to block a delay. But neither are willing to further disrupt the EU by undermining unity on Brexit. The consensus is to allow a delay, which could be confirmed as early as tomorrow.What then  It depends how long the delay is for – but again, the EU is expected to stick to the script. The French government would like to see pressure on MPs ramped up with a short extension. It made the same case when Theresa May put in the request for a delay in Spring and lost the argument – with Macron largely vindicated by the way events have unfolded.General electionBut his stock has fallen with France’s objections to EU enlargement in the Balkans, and circumstances in the UK have also changed – the deal now on offer is less advantageous for all sides, the deadlock in parliament has deepened, and the sense that a general election is the only way out is felt in Brussels as much as London. Leaving space for that to happen is in everyone’s interests.Confirmation of a  January extension removes that last excuse for the opposition to hold off on voting for a general election. With Labour trailing the Tories in the polls by  per cent or more, and Labour MPs fearful of either being seen to have blocked Brexit or going into an election with Jeremy Corbyn as leader – or both – it’s understandable why enthusiasm is limited. In Scotland, among all parties, there is also little excitement at the prospect of a campaign fought in the freezing cold, snow and rain, and many hours of darkness. Turnout could be low, benefitting the most energised – the SNP and the Lib Dems.As Mr Johnson himself said in the Commons – there can’t be much more of this. The government doesn’t want its Brexit deal amended out of recognition by the opposition. His advisor Dominic Cummings wants his people versus parliament campaign. The country and the continent need an escape.The answer is close at hand.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"poll scottish independence voters switching to support the union","story":"The Progress Scotland survey found  per cent of voters ldquocompletely support Scotland staying part of the UK, compared with  per cent who ldquocompletely support Scotland becoming independent.Read more: Poll: Nicola Sturgeonrsquos push for election out of step with ScotsThe Survation poll was commissioned by Progress Scotland, headed by former SNP Westminster leader Angus Robertson, and surveyed , Scots at the start of the month.It sought answers on a spectrum of - to identy strength of opinion on the issue, with  marking ldquocomplete support for staying in the UK, while  ldquocomplete support for independence.A narrow majoritywere more supportive of the Union, with  per cent in the middle and  per cent more supportive of independence.

The proposal was supported by the two SNP councillors in the Barra and South Uist Ward and the five SNP councillors from Lewis and Harris.”In his statement, Councillor MacMillan also accused Labour Highlands and Islands MSP Rhoda Grant of calling for a government inquiry into the issue as a means of “taking the focus” off of comhairle convenor Councillor Norman A MacDonald # whom he described as a “Labour party colleague” to Rhoda Grant # and who has voted, according to Councillor MacMillan, to back the Uist dental plan.Councillor MacMillan added: “Rhoda Grant#s proposal for an inquiry is a politically motivated ersionary tactic designed to prevent the truth about Labour Party councillors voting to close the medical provision at Uist Hospital.“Rhoda Grant should instead call for the Western Isles NHS to start telling the truth, to publish the voting record of the [Integration Joint Board]meeting and explain the real reason for centralising the dental provision into the Uist Hospital which is to close the Operating Theatre and Resuscitation Room to remove the surgical capacity from the hospital.”Responding to the claims, Norman A MacDonald stated that he wasn#t present at the last IJB meeting, and said that “assurances had been given” that the relocation of the dental service in Uist would have “no detrimental impact on the Uist and Barra hospital whatsoever.The convenor added: “After the original vote at the IJB on this matter resulted in a split vote, from then on it was up to the chief executives to decide what would take place.“I have no idea what kind of influence Councillor MacMillan might think I have, as both Uist and Barra hospital and the Western Isles Hospital hospital are solely the responsibility of the health board and it is not for councillors to make any decisions on their future.“I have never discussed in any shape or form either the dental service in Uist or her call for an inquiry with Rhoda Grant.“As to the colour of my politics, Councillor MacMillan#s claims are equally questionable. I have registered for the last fteen years as an independent councillor.”Mrs Grant said: “Councillor MacMillan#s assertion would be laughable were it not such a serious issue in question.“I have, from the outset in , listened to the concerns being raised by constituents, by the Uist Locality Planning Group, by the Association of Community Councils, by a stakeholder event held in Lochboisdale, and by all local elected members serving when this proposal to centralise dental services was first aired.“I have repeatedly made representation to the IJB, to NHS Western Isles, to the comhairle, to the previous Health Secretary, and to the First Minister.“Health boards and local authorities throughout Scotland are having to make incredibly dficult decisions to fit with the reducing budgets they are being given and perhaps Councillor MacMillan, instead of throwing meaningless insults around, would do better focusing on bringing this to the attention of his colleagues in the Scottish Government, opposing jobs and services being taken out of local communities.“This is an appalling decision, which flies in the face of local democracy, and constituents in Uist deserve to have their concerns heard, and heeded.”Officially, it was something called the Integration Joint Board that made the announcement at the end of last month: all roads will soon lead to Balivanich. But the IJB began le as a creature of the big boys it is staffed by officials from both public agencies. Is its independence nominal  It#s hard to be sure.Whatever the limits of its power, it is a useful fig leaf to hide behind. The barrage of flak directed at this rotten decision to centralise a vital health service can be dodged by the likes of NHS Western Isles chief executive Gordon Jamieson. The plan to close three dental surgeries came from the IJB. At least that#s how it was sold to the public.Before too long, everyone in the Uists will have to go to hospital in Balivanichthey need a filling or a tooth extracted. So much for the “professional concerns” comhairle chief executive Malcolm Burr has supposedly spent that last six months mulling over. At the end of September, he fell into line. Unanimity was required in order to proceed, and he delivered it.One particular paragraph from the IJB decision paper is worth quoting in full: “Given his familiarity with the subject matter, the chief executive of NHS Western Isles was able to come to an early view about the best arrangements for the provision of dental services in Uist but the chief executive of the comhairle, having no previous experience of these services, required more time to familiarise himself with the detail.”This admission is revealing. Completely out of his depth, it took Mr Burr six months to swot up on the intricacies of closing three dental surgeries before wielding the axe. In doing so, he perhaps exposed the limits of integrating health and social care, which is the IJB#s raison d#etre. Put simply, it should not be the responsibility of someone with no background in health care to make a decision like this. The IJB say there will be an “outreach” service aimed primarily at South Uist and Eriskay, the latter  miles away from Balivanich along single-track roads. What this pledge means, in dental terms, is still to be decided. Perhaps teeth can be extracted safely in the back of a van.If the fruits of integration — a much-hyped national paradigm — are vandalism on this scale, then we suggest a rethink is in order. The hybrid organisations driving the agenda don#t seem to be accountable to anyone, least of all the voters.Speaking of which, we are glad to see that Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan has had a quiet word with Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick about referring the matter to the Scottish Government. Ultimately, it is Health Secretary Jeane Freeman who has the power to stop this. Hopefully, she#ll use it before Stornoway wrecks a system that has worked well for decades."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH1110NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 11th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

He said: “With the Hallowe’en break upon us, there still unfortunately remains the threat from large volumes of often illegal fireworks in the countryside.  “These illegal fireworks, and especially the loud banger types, still pose a considerable threat to farm livestock. “In my capacity as Constituency MLA, I have welcomed any past seizures in by the police of any amounts of illegal fireworks which could have caused injury not just to others but also to the users. “I appeal to the community thatthey have any knowledge of these types of attacks to give the information as soon as possible to the police so that these people can be brought before the courts and face the due process of the law. “I also appeal to parents to ensure they know that their children are doing. Attacks on live stock are an open attack on the farmer’s livelihood and assets.  “And it’s not just farm animals which have suffered under the threat of the so-called Banger Menace.  “As a community, we have a moral duty to assist the police and the courts in eradicating the threats to le and physical attacks from these Hallowe’en Hoods.  “These socially sick iniduals often get their kicks by intimidating the more vulnerable in our society. As a community, we cannot afford to wait until a flock or herd is burned alive before taking action to help the forces of law and order stamp out the Banger Menace. “As a community, we must not be flippant about the threat of fire dangers to barns and bales, especially with the high costs of replacement fodder for the upcoming winter,” said Assemblyman Swann.

Many of her previous publications topped the book charts in the UK and Ireland, some even making on to the prestigious Sunday Times Best Seller list.In her latest publication, the experienced cook s to her roots with wholesome recipes for easy and affordable meals to suit all occasions - from quick mid-week suppers to the traditional family Sunday lunch.For Jenny, food has come full circle, and her wisdom and advice over her long career has always reflected the needs and trends of society.Since the start of her illustrious career, which has seen her present pioneering television cooking shows, appear at events, establish her cookery school and publish extensively, her personal style has evolved and changed dramatically. Jenny describes her cooking style now as more relaxed and healthier, offering great results with less fuss. She has reflected this approach in her new recipes.Fundamentally, Jenny’s guiding principals have remained the same throughout her career. She wants to empower people to create tasty, wholesome food that brings everyone to the table with a smile on their face.“I have taken familiar recipes and updated them with a modern twist drawing on influences and tastes from the full spectrum of the global cuisine,” Jenny says.“There are few people who don’t appreciate the merits of a Sunday roast dinner, a slice of cake and warm, home-baked bread served with a bowl of soup.“My roots are in the country and in my new book I want people to connect with our world-class, local produce and enjoy the bounty of nature all around us while supporting and strengthening our food infrastructure.“I understand everyone is struggling in these uncertain times. We are all juggling busy schedules, domestic budgeting and a healthy diet, so I have created a collection of streamlined recipes for lighter, fresher dishes that are easy to prepare and heartwarmingly delicious and nutritious.”At Home With Jenny features food for all seasons from Valentine’s Day to Christmas and everything in between. It’s perfect for both novice and seasoned cooks with sections covering starters, mains, outdoor cooking and wonderfully tempting sweet treats.Jenny’s experience has taught her the strong connection between a positive, balanced diet and good physical and mental health. In this new book, she is keen to promote the whole experience of a healthy food lestyle.“Food is a great way to bring people together both formally and informally. I am encouraging people to make these dishes and sit down at the table with family and friends converse and enjoy the food. “Every meal is an occasion to connect and what better to do it than over food made with love,” Jenny says.At Home With Jenny features recipes for pizza, fish dishes, steak, casseroles, cakes, salads, and lots more. Seasonal dishes include sumptuous autumnal Roasted Bramley Apple and Pumpkin Soup, as well as warming Crusted Tart with Pulled Brisketand Filo topping - just perfect for winter days.Each dish in this collection has a strong connection to nature and landscape reflecting Jenny’s love of the outdoors which she pursues by surfing on the North Coast and sparking up outdoor cooking at every opportunity – even to make Christmas dinner!It has been four years since Jenny last published a book. In that time, she has been kept incredibly busy with her cookery school in Cullybackey, and appearing at events right across Northern Ireland.Jenny says: “Over the last few years, I have been out of the home kitchen and connecting with people from all walks of le. “This has afforded me a fantastic experience to discuss and find out directly what people actually want when it comes to cooking at home.“Recently, there has been a push-back against the relentless demands of digital technology. Many people find cooking a mindful way of relaxing while nourishing their minds, bodies and souls. People want simplicity and to be connected to how their food is sourced and prepared.“In my new book, I have carefully considered all the important contemporary food issues such as dietary requirements, time and finances and I have put together a simple guide to help everyone make healthy choices that satisfy your appetite for le!”Home With Jenny is available now from jenny@jennybristow and at book signing events throughout Ireland.It is priced at pound.

In the event that these programmes cannot be maintained, establishing comprehensive successor programmes is essential,” said Mr Crowe.The committee previously heard how communities along the border both north and south are lagging economically since  in stark contrast to strong economic growth and employment in other parts of Ireland and Northern Ireland.To tackle this, the committee recommends the promotion of the border region as alternatives to the Dublin area for Foreign Direct Investment the promotion of the three border regions as areas of national importance and the comprehensive upgrading of infrastructure, both transport and broadband, to assist connectivity in the region.It also recommends thatthe National Broadband Plan cannot be advanced further to deliver in its current format, an alternative solution is needed for the border region."},{"url":null,"title":"government contradictory on goods checks between northern ireland and gb","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Ms Patel has since written to the committee to clary the position within the Northern Ireland Protocol, confirming that administrative procedures including a declaration will be required when goods move from GB to Northern Ireland. Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper said: “In the last three days, dferent senior members of the Government have said contradictory things about checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain and the other way round. Home Office confirms there will be checks on goods between GB and Northern Ireland under Govt deal. @CommonsHomeAffs has just received this memorandum. The Home Secretary couldn’t answer this in committee yesterday pic RDabFqx— Yvette CooperOctober , “This is too important to be fudged. They need to be straight with people about what checks there will be.“From the Home Secretary’s letter, it is clear now that there will be checks on goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland – but why could she and the Home Office not be clear about that yesterday at the committee  Those checks will have a signicant impact on Northern Ireland.“This makes it even more serious that the Prime Minister is trying to avoid scrutiny – both from the Liaison Committee and for his legislation in Parliament. You can’t hide something as important as this.” In written evidence, sent to the committee overnight after her appearance on Wednesday, Ms Patel said on the issue of goods moving from GB to Northern Ireland: “For the protection of the single regulatory zone and consumers on the island of Ireland, and to ensure that the correct tarfs are applied, we will need information on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. “Therefore, administrative procedures including a declaration will be required, which can be completed online.”On goods moving from Northern Ireland to GB, she wrote: “This deal explicitly allows the UK to ensure unfettered market access for goods moving from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. “The UK does not therefore intend to carry out checks on such movements of goods. There will be a minimal administrative process which is designed to prevent, for example, trade in endangered species.” She added: “We will work with the EU to eliminate this limited process as soon as possible after Brexit.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  North Ireland Secretary Julian Smith insisted that checks will be minimal after Brexit, but was unable to give details Meanwhile, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay sought to reassure MPs and businesses about the nature of checks on goods between Northern Ireland and GB proposed in the new Brexit deal.He said it would be an “administrative process” which would involve “fairly straightforward data”.Mr Barclay claried comments made by Boris Johnson on Wednesday when he said there would be no checks between Northern Ireland and GB.“It is the case the Prime Minister was distinguishing between the paperwork that is required, which will be done digitally and is a single form, rather than actually introducing physical checks.“In the coming months, we will need to work both within the United Kingdom and with the European Union to discuss how to eliminate the limited and administrative processes,” Mr Barclay said. Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith insisted on Wednesday that checks will be minimal after Brexit, but he was to give any further detail.Mr Johnson has previously said fresh regulatory and customs checks in the Irish Sea would not happen on his watch.Shadow Northern Ireland secretary Tony Lloyd said: “The Government is in complete disarray about the impact of its sell-out Brexit deal on Northern Ireland.“The Brexit Secretary says there will be border checks, the Prime Minister claims there won’t be, and the Home Secretary cannot say for sure one way or the other.“Boris Johnson should come to Parliament at the earliest opportunity to clary the Government’s position and apologise for misleading MPs about the consequences of his Brexit deal on trade within the UK.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A last-ditch attempt to block abortion law changes in Northern Ireland led by the DUP failed, with the law changing at midnight on Monday. Unionist parties, who oppose the upcoming liberalisation, triggered the assemblys recall with a signed petition. Members of the SDLP were also in attendance. But Speaker, Robin Newton, informed MLAs that the Assembly had to elect a speaker and deputies with cross community support before any other business could take place. That became impossible when SDLP leader Colum Eastwood declared he wasn’t willing to facilitate a “unionist talking shop” and led his party out of the chamber. As they made their way out cries of “shame” were shouted by DUP MLAs. googletag.cmd.push As a result of their leaving no nationalist representatives remained, meaning no new speaker could be elected and the sitting was suspended after less than an hour. Jim Allister accused the SDLP of thwarting the formation of an Assembly and said they were therefore thwarting legislation to protect the lives of unborn children. The DUP later walked out, vowing that this was not the end of the matter and they would seek to challenge the law. Mrs Foster said it was a shameful day which would leave Northern Ireland with Europes most liberal abortion laws. They were swtly followed by the UUP after Robin Swann labelled the day’s events a “pantomime” and called on the Secretary of State to consider whether there is any future for the NI Assembly. ‘Pantomime’ Some unionist assembly members had been attempting to introduce the Defence of the Unborn Child Bill , which they hoped to pass by midnight. Two members tabled a Private Members’ Bill in an attempt to halt the Westminster legislation decriminalising abortion. DUP MLA Paul Givan argued the point as to why it should happen having sought legal advice from the Attorney General. The DUP leader Arlene Foster implored the Speaker to share his legal advice with MLAs. However, Mr Newton - who was elected as a DUP MLA - resisted attempts to persuade him to suspend assembly rules to allow the bill to be introduced. Legal advice was sought, he said, and he was content with the guidance provided which is “confidential and privileged”. In July, MPs at Westminster passed legislation which requires the government to liberalise abortion and extend same-sex marriage to Northern Irelanddevolution is not restored by  October. Mondays sitting was the first time the assembly had sat for nearly three years.

A meeting of the NI Affairs Committee heard evidence from Secretary of State for NI Julian Smith and other government officials. During the evidence session Mr Smith acknowledged that poundm spent on MLA salaries since  is “unacceptable” when challenged by North Down MP Lady Hermon. It was also stated that relative trade flows set out in the impact assessment accompanying the Withdrawal Agreement Bill show that NI has a total trading bill of poundbn with GB, pound.bn with Ireland and pound.bn with the rest of the EU. googletag.cmd.push DUP MP Gregory Campbell therefore said trade on an East-West basis is “signicantly greater” than any other trade. He referred to a Treasury Select Committee meeting where it was mentioned that the current Brexit deal will result in administrative costs for businesses. “Can you understand that businesses will want more than a reassurance  On the other side of the equation people ask for and demand that it be written in stone, in a legislative process, because guarantees come and go and governments come and go, but the legislation is more dficult to change. “Do you understand why people would want to see that reassurance that you’ve given in the Bill ” The SoS said he does understand andthe Withdrawal Deal Bill was brought forward he would look to insert clauses to make “crystal clear” that the unfettered access commitment in relation to the flow of goods from GB to NI are laid down in law. He also said that he wants to work with every sector to minimise any challenges, adding that he sees it as a “huge opportunity” for businesses here. Labour MP Conor McGinn said unionists and nationalists have inevitably become ided on the constitutional issue of whether to have a land border on the island of Ireland or one down the Irish Sea. The St Helens North MP askedthe best way would be for the whole of the UK to be in a Customs Union with the EU. The SoS disagreed believing it would prevent the UK from striking trade deals with other countries and he feels the current deal offers the “best of both worlds” for NI. Mr McGinn put it to him that it is bad for NI to have either border. Julian Smith referred to his previous response to Gregory Campbell and sought to give assurances that there will be very little bureaucracy involved. Who made the “seismic” decision to switch policy from a border on the island to one down the Irish Sea , Mr McGinn asked. The complaint about the previous Bill was that NI would be trapped in a backstop, Mr Smith responded, and that has been done away with. He was then askedhe wished to apologise to unionists for making a promise that couldn’t be kept, but said he believes it has no impact on the constitutional position of NI or workings of the Assembly. Irish Language Act Speaking later at the meeting, East Derry MP Mr Campbell said that apart from Sinn Feacutein no other has put down an “absolute fundamental precondition” before they will go back into Stormont. In Mr Smith’s view there are a “number of issues” and he urged all parties to be “flexible”. “I understand the need for diplomacy but there is only one party saying we will not move until a pre-condition we have set arbitrarily is met and that’s Sinn Feacutein,” Mr Campbell remarked. He added that through amendments at Westminster one of their preconditions has been met and there was a “ludicrous and absurd” suggestion that the other one should be met, “the Irish Language Act”. The DUP MP said the British government has accepted this “blackmail” without asking for cross-community consent. He said either devolution is over or the rules have to be rewritten. Mr Smith responded: “There are absolutely no plans for the Irish Language Act coming from Westminster. Absolutely none. “On the issues of abortion and same sex marriage, these are devolved matters, they should be resolved in NI, the challenge I think there is, is that as the Assembly continues to be absent, no Executive, colleagues here at Westminster got frustrated and it was a free vote issue that went through.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The brown bear can call Ireland home again after a , year wait thanks to an Inishowen man with a big dream. This Friday, passionate wildle lover Killian McLaughlin will see his lelong dream of reintroducing some of Irelands extinct animals to their former natural habitat become a reality when the gates to his new sanctuary opens to the public. Built on a -acre site at Dundrain, Burnfoot, Wild Ireland has become home to three brown bears, three wolves, a lynx and other species of animals previously native to Ireland but now extinct here. googletag.cmd.push Among the  species of animals at the sanctuary includes a troop of Barbary Macaque monkeys.  Killian McLaughlin pictured with his wolves at the soon to be opened Wild Ireland animal sanctuary this weekend.  Speaking to the Derry Now, Killian said the purpose of Wild Ireland was to educate people on Irelands lost natural history, whilst giving a home to badly neglected animals. “If you go back thousands of years to when Ireland was covered in forest you would have found these animals roaming about,” Killian explained. “Due to humans, these creatures have been lost forever through hunting and deforestation. “What were trying to do here is to educate people that these animals belong here. We are quick to condemn other countries in Africa or Asia about the cruelty of hunting but we have already lost or native animals through hunting. “There are fossils of brown bears found in caves that show how many bears we had in Ireland thousands of years ago, the same goes for the lynx. “We have three wolves here and they only went extinct from Ireland in .” Working with several charities, Killian and his team rescued the animals from terrible conditions. “Working with Bears in Mind, we managed to persuade the Lithuanian government to give us the bears for rehoming. “They were kept in terrible conditions, they never even felt soil before, they were so used to concerte they were unsure of the ground but now they are beginning to be bears again. “We built them a three-metre deep pool so they can submerge themselves, before that the deepest water they had known was in their water dish,” Killian said. Despite being a full time job in itself, Killian has to juggle his work at the sanctuary with his day-job of being a solicitor. “Its been full on,” Killian laughed. “But I love what were doing here. Its so rewarding to see these animals have a chance of a new le.” Wild Ireland opens this weekend, on Friday, October , and will be open daily from am to pm, with last admission every day at pm, costing only € per adult and € per child. Wild Ireland is located close to White Oaks Retreat Centre, between Muff and Burnfoot. You can follow Wild Ireland on Facebook @wildirelandorg and visit the website at www.wildireland .org.

Danielle Doherty and Emma Bradley received hearftelt congratulations from across the city when photos of them at ious city centre landmarks appeared on social media on the day of their wedding. The couple also revealed that a photo of them taken at Free Derry Corner was their way of acknowledging the battle for civil rights for all at the iconic monument. googletag.cmd.push At midnight on Monday, same-sex marriage legislation in Northern Ireland fell into line with England, Scotland and Wales after Westminster enacted the laws in the continuing absence of Stormont. Same-sex marriage was recognised in the Republic of Ireland in May  after a referendum decreed a change in the constitution that marriage was legal irrespective of the gender of the partners. Danielle told the Derry News: “Having a wedding in the North wasnt an option. It wasnt anything I wanted to do, because I didnt want a civil partnership, I wanted a marriage. Im Irish, I live in Ireland and so I wanted to get married here, and it was legal here, so we went to Donegal. “I think a civil partnership made it seem that what we had was less important – it undermined the whole relationship. And, Emma said: “We didnt even consider looking at venues in the North, we werent interestedit wasnt a marriage. I thought why should other people be allowed to marrythey are in love  Why are we any dferent  We had to border hop to be treated the same. “When Danielle proposed she didnt ask will you be my civil partner, she asked will you marry me  Asked what the couple thought of the situation where it took the intervention of Westminster legislation to equalise laws on same sex marriage with England. Scotland and Wales, Danielle told the Derry News: “It just seemed asa small minority of people, the DUP, used this to keep themselves in power somehow. Its just baffling that such people exist who have such backward views about the whole thing. But, we would have never waited until it was implemented here before we got married. It was never going to stop us. Emma added: “The rest of the world is moving forward, but it seemed that Northern Ireland was just stuck in the s or s and wasnt moving forward with the rest of the UK or Ireland. I dont care whether it was Westminster or Stormont who brought the changes in the law about. It doesnt bother me how it got in. I think it needed to be taken outside of here because it needed that extra push. Up until a few days ago we were married in the south of Ireland, England, Scotland and Wales but not in our own country. We were only civil partners here.” Danielle said: “For the wedding we decided to do things unconventionally. For a start, we chose to get married on Friday th, because we both consider ourselves to be pretty unlucky,” she laughed. “We got ready together in the morning and had our hair and make-up done together. We went for photos around Derry before the ceremony. “We went to Free Derry Corner and the Museum of Free Derry, the Craft Village and into Peadar ODonnells and poured pints. We love Derry, and ideally yes, it would have been lovely to have got married in Derry but because of the laws it wasnt an option. So we got photos at landmarks that people would know and after that went done to Rockhill House in Letterkenny and got married there. “We had a spiritualist of Ireland ceremony so it was all legal because we couldnt get a registrar in time. And the reception was at Rockhill House that evening. I think we enjoyed it more because we got to spend the whole day together,” Danielle continued. Emma added: “If we had done things traditionally, we wouldnt have seen each other until .pm that day.” The couple admit that getting a wedding picture taken at Free Derry Corner was a purposeful move given the monuments iconic association with the civil rights movement over the last  years. “For me it was. Whenever we met with our photographer she wanted to know where we wanted pictures taken. The first thing we said was Free Derry Corner,” said Danielle. Emma said: “Free Derry Corner, to me is about it being called Free Derry – its about being who you want and doing what you want. People lost their lives for civil rights and we were making a stand that we deserve civil rights as well.” Both women said they had anticipated receiving a few derogatory comments and stares whilst making their way around the Bogside but in fact were overwhelmed by the kind responses of all they encountered, especially after some of the images were posted on social media. “I wasnt really expecting the feedback that it got. We were doing it for us, for our personal reasons.Then seeing the comments on Facebook of people appreciating us taking a stand for our civil rights was great. “When we got off the ten hour flight going on honeymoon and checked our phones, there were hundreds of shares and likes on the phptos that the photographer Lisa Byrne had put up. It was unexpected. Were just two wee girls from Derry that wanted to get married,” said Danielle. The Derry News also askedthe couple have ever felt let down by the political system despite regularly exercising their votes. Emma said: “Personally, sometimes Ive wondered what I am voting for. I have the right to vote and I will use it, but at the end of the day,theres nobody that speaks to me then Im really going to have to consider who I vote for. Danielle added: “There is no Stormont obviously, but thats got to with larger factors. The DUP said no to same-sex marriage and werent willing to compromise. They are obsessed with being part of the UK, but they dont want all of the UKs laws.” So, what were the thoughts when same-sex marriage passed into law in Northern Ireland earlier this week  “My thoughts were, thanks, but weve done it already. You are too late. It doesnt change that me and Danielle are married, but I am happy for the people that spent years fighting for this. We could have been people who said we are not going to get married until it was legal here. But it was legal in this country, you just had to go over the border to get it. But, its a positive thing thats happened. “Anybody in our situation who have struggled with their sexuality have felt dferent and felt that they didnt belong. The solution comes with years of trying to love yourself and trying to accept yourself and realise that you are a person and youre ok to be who you want to be. “I think for teenagers now and people who are coming out younger and younger, it is still dficult to deal with in top of all the other adolescent problems they have to go through. Danielle added: “It was going to happen eventually. It had to go down that road, it was just a matter of when. It couldnt be put off forever. Its great for future generations in that they can be themselves now. Its more acceptable now, its not that big social taboo anymore. Things have progressed a lot. “Were really fortunate with our families, our parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles who have all be really supportive.” Emma concluded: “I would never deny Danielle, or who you are to me, or my sexuality to anyone. If people dont like it, thats tough.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Dungiven-born GAA was the latest interviewee of Dion Fanning, who runs the Ireland Unfiltered Podcast for Joe.ie.The episode, released on Tuesday, was recorded in Derry. Speaking about the city, Brolly said that he had “always had great affection for” the late Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness. He told a story about McGuinness arriving at the Brolly home when Joe was around six or seven to be “driven across the border.” “I knew Martin for a long time. Martin used to be a visitor at our house when he was a young man,” Brolly said. googletag.cmd.push “I remember my mother putting a  beard on him and, as I recall, the story was that he was going to university and he was my older brother.” He went on to say that McGuinness appeared to have a profound effect on former DUP leader Peter Robinson but that Robinson was “destroyed by the loonies” within his party.  The late Martin McGuinness  He said that he believedSinn Feacutein and the DUP had worked together they could have “attracted money from all over the world” to the north, but this could not happen as “in the end, the DUP is about narrow self-interest.” “I dont think the DUP care about other people. I dont think that people like Sammy Wilson or Gregory Campbell have any concern for their fellow man,” he said. Brolly also spoke about encountering DUP leader Arlene Foster as a young man in Belfast. “She was in the same class as I was and I always found it extraordinary that she was perpetually enraged. I mean, I never saw her when she wasnt enraged,” Brolly said. During the interview he also spoke about his childhood in Dungiven, attending boarding school in Armagh and his work with organ donation charities. He also praised the sense of community he experienced across Ireland with members of the GAA, which he contrasted with England, “a nation of strangers.” “The starting point for any civilised society is community, a sense of community for its own sake and for the sake of prosperity and a sense of empathy with your fellow man,” Brolly said. “What we still have here and why I evangelise so strongly about the GAA, is that the starting point of community is I know you. I dont know you, but I know you. So I gave a kidney to a guy – I didnt know who he was – but he was a GAA man and he had kids that played GAA, that was good enough for me.” Brolly donated his kidney to Shane Finnegan in , after the pair had worked together as coaches for St Brigids GAA club in Belfast. He said during his recovery his mother came in with “thousands and thousands and thousands of letters and messages and cards” from supporters and well-wishers. However due to his reputation as a GAA pundit meant that the messages were not all entirely complimentary, particularly one letter from Ballintubber, Co Mayo. “It started off like all the others. Congratulations on your magnicent gesture in donating a kidney to a fellow Gael. Any chance you could donate the other one ”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The midfielder believes there are no excuses for the manner of Tuesday’s defeat to St. Patrick’s Athletic, which has all but ended the Candystripes’ hopes of finishing third and has put them under added pressure to get the one point they need against their Northwest rivals. City are still expected to get the job done against Harps but Tuesday’s defeat served as a timly warning that nothing is yet certain. googletag.cmd.push “It’s kind of hard to put your finger on it,” he said. “I’m surprised with ourselves given what was at stake that we didn’t kick on. It’s a disappointing night there’s no two ways about it and we’re disappointed with the result and we need to put that right on Friday night. “There are factors out of our control like we had a fixture on Saturday with a heavy pitch in Sligo but it’s not an excuse. We needed to bring more to the game and we didn’t and we’ve come out on the wrong side.” It all looked to be going City’s way when David Parkhouse gave them the lead in the early stages of the second half, but a quick equaliser from Chris Forrester plus two goals in three minutes from substitute James Doona meant that St. Pat’s gave themselves one more fighting chance of stealing fourth place from Derry City. “We expected to kick on and win the game from there but they score and get a bit of a momentum sht and the ball has fallen their way of the second goal and we are chasing the game,” Sloggett reflected. “No matter what stage of the season you’re at, when you lose a game you want the next game to come as quickly as possible and we’re lucky in that sense. We’ll freshen up and we’ll be ready to go and we’ll put another three points on the board hopefully.” Tuesday’s game was City’s second in four days after a break of , an inconsistency in the scheduling that has happened more than once this season. Again, however, Sloggett dismissed that as an excuse. “This is what the league decides,” he continued. “The international fixtures came at a strange time and this is the way that the games fell. We needed to deal with that but we’re disappointed with that. “We’ll have to go back and look at it and see where we went wrong and where we can make things better. They were good on the night and played with a lot of energy and we failed to match that. We can’t make excuses and we have to go and fix things.” After the celebrations at Sligo on Saturday past, it was widely expected that City would get the point they needed on Tuesday night to secure Europa League football at the Brandywell next season. The fact that they didn’t surprised many, but Sloggett dismissed suggestions of complacency. “I don’t think so,” he said. “I think we came with the intention to win the game because we were targeting that third spot. It’s out of our hands now but it’s still a possibility. I don’t think we came complacent. “We’re obviously very disappointed with our performance and not to have kicked on and won the game when we went - up but we have to put that right. “I think at the start of the season you would have taken a win in your last game to qualy for Europe and hopefully we can go and do that.”  Recognition Meanwhile, City striker David Parkhouse has been named in the PFAI Team of the Year and has also been nominated for the Young Player of the Year award.

That has to be the target,” he insisted. “There are six points up for grabs Bohemians are three ahead of us but I think we are two goals ahead of them now. We want to try and make six points upwe can but we know that’s extremely dficult but we’re at home and our home form has been good. “We are playing a team that is competing for Europe on Tuesday night and we need the fans, we need everyone in Derry to muster the effort and energy to come and support us because it would be brilliant and it could be a really good occasion. This is going to go to the last game no matter what andwe want to finish third orwe want to qualy for Europe then we have two games to win. googletag.cmd.push Unusual City’s winning goal was unusual to say the least but for Devine it was a case of his team making their own luck.“I think it started with our aggressive press,” he said. “It started with David Parkhouse pushing really hard to get down the line. Obviously it was a bit of fortune for us but Barry had to be in there, he had to be chasing the ball down. “It was a bit of fortune but over the course of the year we haven’t carried a lot of luck. We have been on the receiving end of some bad luck so we’ll take a win by any means tonight. It’s the first time as manager that I’ve won in Sligo so it’s a big win for me.”Devine and his players celebrated enthusiastically in front of the City fans at the final whistle and the manager admitted that the bond between both parties has been a key element of success this year.“It’s all about the fans,” he said. “You see the players’ response to the players and the players’ response to the fans. There’s a real feel about the club at the minute. People are spending money on a Saturday to come down here and we’re very grateful for that. “We’re very grateful of the crowds we’ve had in the Brandywell this year, we’re very grateful that when we’re - down after  minutes the fans aren’t turning on us and they keep encouraging us and keep singing. “It’s all about the fans, it’s all about getting this club back to where I believe it can go. “There will be nobody happier to see us land in Europe this year but there’s still a lot of work to be done.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Derry City captain scored the winning goal against Sligo Rovers on Saturday night to pout his team on the verge of a remarkable turnaround in fortunes for a team which finished in eighth place in the Premier Division last year.A solitary point against St. Patrick’s Athletic at the Brandywell tomorrow night would seal the deal for Derry City and McNamee admitted that all focus is now on getting the job done. “We were watching the results on Friday night and saw that Pat’s slipped up a wee bit so and we spoke about that before the game because it was a good chance to put a gap between us,” he stated. “We need just one point now from the last two games so we’ll just focus on ourselves because we have a big game on Tuesday night again so it’s about getting ourselves right in the next two days. It’s a quick turnaround but we’ll be ready for it.”McNamee scored only his second goal of the season at Sligo to win Saturday night’s game after goalkeeper Ed McGinty hit it straight at the City captain as he attempted to clear it. For McNamee, it was just about being in the right place at the right time. “The ball was played back to the keeper and I went to put a wee bit of pressure on him but you don’t really expect anything to happen but he more or less kicked it straight at me and I just put the foot out and guided it in,” he explained.“People think I didn’t mean it but I don’t care. The team is going to come before how many goals I get. “This was a big goal which puts us a wee bit closer but whether it’s me or not it doesn’t really “We had a very sloppy start and again another slack goal was given away but credit to the boys again, all season there have been obstacles thrown at us and we’ve always answered. It was a big win and as Decky says, you don’t win too many games down here.”The Candy Stripes can still secure third place with home victories over St. Pat’s and Finn Harps this week with Declan Devine emphatic that his players give everything in these last two games, there should be plenty of entertainment at the Brandywell over the next few days. “Our aim is to win the last two games,” McNamee continued. “If Bohs win their last game it will go down to goal dference but we’re aiming for third place. “At the end of the day fourth place gets Europe so we have got to nail that down on Tuesday night andwe win that and beat Harps hopefully we’ll get third place as well. Obviously our objective is to finish third but next seasonwe’re playing in Europe no-one will careyou finish third or fourth. “The boys in there just don’t give up. You saw tonight again when we went behind we came back. Over the years at Derry whenever you went behind it wasn’t too often you came back again. “There’s a great character in the group and a never say die attitude and that’s all you can ask for.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Two goals in three minutes from substitute James Doona sealed the points for the Dubliners who now move to just two points behind Derry City in fourth place with one league game remaining.  After a forgettable first half, Derry got the goal the game desperately needed on  minutes when Ciaran Coll raced into the area and as Clarke came out to narrow the angle, he simply rolled the ball across the face of goal for David Parkhouse to slot home his th goal of the season. googletag.cmd.push The game was now more open and it did not take St. Pat’s long to level the game when Ian Bermingham’s shot deflected kindly into the path of Chris Forrester who turned and fired low past Cherrie into the net to make it -. The final  minutes were extremely tense with the game in the balance but Derry came within inches of restoring their lead when Junior released McDonagh on the right and his low ball shot right across the face of goal with no Derry player there to touch it into the net. The Brandywell was stunned into silence however as St. Pat’s scored two goals in three minutes to seal the win. Substitute James Doona, on the pitch a matter of moments, raced clear of the Derry defence and sent the ball past Peter Cherrie who didn’t move as the ball rolled past him into the net. Derry tried hard to respond but they were stunned again when Pat’s broke after Darren McCauley lost the ball in an advanced position and Jake Walker picked out Doona who got in behind again and slotted the ball past Cherrie to seal the win for the visitors.

She insists that she intends to deliver the authentic voice of moderate, progressive Irish nationalism in a place where it needs to be heard.And she has vowed to be a hard working Peer, lobbying and building alliances with other peers and parties across the chamber that will bring benefit to people in Northern Ireland.And while the former MP regrets no longer being a member of the SDLP, she said her political views have not altered and will reflect the partyrsquos central social democratic messages focused on the needs of people and the principles of equality, fairness and social justice for all in the House of Lords.With her new title now confirmed, Baroness Ritchie described Downpatrick as a ldquohistoric place on the island of Ireland, where St Patrick began and ended his ministry.ldquoThe town is a place of immense heritage and has a longstanding history. It is uniquely associated on the island with the patron saint and is also associated with the Normans and the Vikings, she continued.ldquoDownpatrick is also place of inclusion and a shared society. The area was one of the first to share power at local government level and in the days of the old Urban Council, it had responsibility for allocating housing and did so very much on the basis of need.The Baroness said the Downpatrick area was very much at the vanguard of political inclusion in terms of ensuring that people belonged, explaining that she plans to use her new title to promote the town.Her House of Lords induction takes place on November  with her formal introduction taking place the following day when she will be introduced by her two sponsors on the floor of the chamber.Baroness Ritchiersquos sponsors will be former Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Lord Paul Murphy and Baroness Angela Smith, who is the shadow leader of the Lords.She is also former NIO minister who was responsible for the the health, economy and environment portfolios during her time at Stormont.Lord Murphy was also Minister of State and led the British Government in the talks process that led to the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie continued: ldquoI have picked my two sponsors on the basis that while I am going into the House of Lords as non-aligned and independent, my two sponsors understand the mechanics of the Good Friday Agreement and understand inclusion and power-sharing.ldquoMy maiden speech will hopefully take place sometime before the end of the year, although that could be subject to changea general election is called.Looking to the future, the Baroness said she has been using the past few weeks to get briefed on key issues which are important to her, including Brexit and its impact on the agri-food economy and local economy.ldquoTo me, there is no such thing as a good Brexit. The best deal for me is one where we will remain in the EU. What we have been presented with is one that is a bita curatersquos egg in many ways. There will ne no hard border which means no economic border and no veto in terms of the Assembly. Having said that, I am going to have to examine the Brexit deal in greater depth, she continued.ldquoThere are other issues that I want to focus on including the contaminated bloods issue, tourism VAT and what can be done to help our economy and ensure that we can grow and develop. The vaginal mess issue is something I have been associated with as is the importance of the Co Down fishing industry.Baroness Ritchie said while she does not have constituents, she will be speaking in a general Northern Ireland-wide context.ldquoI will be highlighting the importance of reflecting our political ersity and respect for political dference, ensuring that our institutions are up and running and that they respect the relationships between Ireland and Britain and Northern Ireland and the South. Sadly these have been down for nearly three years, she said.The Baroness added: ldquoMy appointment to the House of Lords is an evolution.

The same player then had a glorious chance for a goal when he got in behind the Kilcoo full back line, but lsquokeeper Martin McCourt made a brilliant save.The lsquoPoint continued to see plenty of the ball with corner forward Aron DrsquoArcy foraging deep, but they wasted a few kickable frees before Kilcoorsquos Ryan McEvoy brought the sides level with a free in the ninth minute.Ross McGarry then found his range and exchanged frees with Paul Devlin before the Kilcoo marksman punished Warrenpoint for another defensive indiscretion with his second point in quick succession.Ryan Johnston started seeing a lot more of the ball for Kilcoo, but it was Warrenpoint who drew level the th minute with a well-taken score from Ruairi McCormack.McGarry pointed Warrenpoint into a - to - lead after  minutes, but Kilcoo responded immediately with a m free from McCourt.Ryan Johnston then went on a searing run down the right flank and bore down on goal, but flashed his shot wide of Gary McMahonrsquos far post when he really should have tested the lsquokeeper.Devlin and McGarry swapped frees as the interval approached, but their was still time for the energetic Aidan Branagan to bomb forward from his full back berth to point Kilcoo into a - to - half-time lead.Warrenpoint were certainly not overawed by Kilcoo and started the second half the same way they attacked from the opening whistle of the game, but it was Kilcoo who edged into a - to - lead after  minutes with another score from the rampaging Ward.A McGarry free quickly negated this score before Kilcoo received a bad blow when Darryl Branagan was black carded and replaced by Shealan Johnston in the th minute.McGarry converted the resultant free to bring the sides level, but the game was really opening up at this stage and McMahon prevented a certain goal at the other end when he saved from Aiden Branagan.Warrenpoint went straight back on the attack and McGarry gave them a - to - lead with  minutes remaining. Devlin then brought the sides level with a rsquo after a Jerome Johnston shot went perilously close.Ryan McEvoy and Anton Magill swapped scores to keep it all square going into the last  minutes, but Warrenpoint kicked for home when John Boyle majestically pointed his side into a - to - lead.Kilcoo responded with venom. Conor Laverty, who had been on the periphery of the game up until this stage, suddenly took centre stage.Nothing looked on when he received the ball about m from goal. However, he checked back inside his marker and somehow spotted Wardrsquos run from deep.An improvised flick-pass, albeit with the aid of a deflection, picked out the big midfielder and he made no mistake with an unerring finish past McMahon.That should have finished Warrenpoint off, but far from it.They immediately attacked in numbers and worked an opening for McGarry, but he sent his effort wide with the goal at his mercy.A McGarry free gave Warrenpoint some consolation and left a single point between the sides with  minutes played.The game was still anybodyrsquos, but consecutive scores from McEvoy and Jerome and Ryan Johnston seemed to put daylight between the entities with  minutes gone.Another McGarry free cut the deficit to three points as the game went into added time. Warrenpoint continued to bombard Kilcoo and further points from Donagh McAleenan and McGarry left a point in it, but Kilcoo won dirty ball when it mattered and ran the clock down to run out worthy winners.Kilcoo: Martin McCourt , Niall Branagan, Aidan Branagan , Niall McEvoy, Aaron Branagan, Darryl Branagan, Miceal Rooney, Ryan McEvoy , Dylan Ward , Anthony Morgan, Paul Devlin , Ryan Johnston , Eugene Branagan, Jerome Johnston , Conor Laverty.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen.

Any proposals would be subject to full consultation, meaning all interested parties would have an opportunity to share their views before any decision is made.ldquoShould proposals progress, they would also be subject to separate planning consultation.ldquoThis would include consideration of highways and traffic concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have had nine spaces taken away, which means  cars will be battling for spaces.ldquoWe understand the need to reduce cars and danger in the area but the way itrsquos been done will lead to reductions in house prices and make parking dficult for current residents.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the past he chaired the all-party Parliamentary group on nuisance calls and secured changes to the law to restrict cold telephone calling.ldquoThere have been a number of complaints about the increase in nuisance callers and the rise of the doorstep economy in the Vale of Glamorgan. Ahead of the clocks going back, Alun wants to provide constituents with a proven means of reducing the number of doorstep callers.Welsh Labour parliamentary candidate for the Vale, Belinda Loveluck-Edwards said: ldquoIt appears that Alun Cairns is using public money to try and block his political opponents from speaking to voters. This must be investigated.ldquoThis is a deliberate attempt to present a  equivalence between genuine political canvassing and those who would wish to scam vulnerable people.ldquoMany people will be deeply unsettled by this behaviour from Cairns at the same time as the Tories are attempting to suppress votes by making it a requirement to show ID at polling stations- a move that will disproportionately affect working class, ethnic minority and young voters.ldquoThis is not how politics should be done. In contrast, Welsh Labour is opening up politics by extending votes to  and  year olds in future Assembly elections.

However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Tory chairman James Cleverly insisted Brexit could still happen on October , telling BBC Radio rsquos Today programme: ldquoThe EU has not agreed an extension and therefore it is absolutely essential that we make sure that we are ready to leave.Mr Johnson will chair a meeting of his political Cabinet ndash without civil servants ndash on Thursday afternoon. It is thought discussion of an election is likely to be on the agenda. There are fears among Conservatives thatthere is an election before the UK has left the EU, it will play into the hands of Nigel Faragersquos Brexit Party.EvenMr Johnson does decide to press for an early election, there is no guarantee that he will succeed. -- vw,vw,px, px\"The PMrsquos chief adviser Dominic Cummings is said to be leading the push for an early election  --Under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act he would need a ldquosuper majority of two-thirds of all MPs to call an election which would require Labour support.Jeremy Corbyn has said Labour is ready to go to the country once it is sure Mr Johnson cannot ldquocrash out in a no-deal Brexit in the middle of a campaign.Shadow chancellor John McDonnell, however, said Labour is prepared for an election before Christmas ldquo necessary.ldquoWersquore hoping, step by step, hoping we can get some agreement with the Government hellip If we canrsquot, wersquore up for an election for whenever it comes, and wersquore confident, he told ITVrsquos Peston programme.But that stance appears to be at odds with the fact there iswidespread opposition to an election among the partyrsquos MPs at a time when they are trailing in the polls. -- vw,vw,px, px\" --Any decision is likely to wait until Friday when EU leaders are expected to decide whether, and for how long, there should be another Brexit delay.It is widely thought they will agree a so-called ldquoflextension to the end of January, with the option for the UK to leave before thenthere is agreement in Parliament on a deal.If leaders cannot come to an agreement, it could mean there will have to be an EU emergency summit, probably on Monday, just three days before the UK is currently due to leave.It follows reports that French President Emmanuel Macron is keen to press for a short extension of  days.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in .

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey. APCOA sees this investment as strengthening their position in Northern Ireland and providing a  for increased growth.Combining the existing APCOA expertise and customer base across both countries, this acquisition now makes APCOA a leading mobile parking operator in cashless parking providing convenient, cashless and cost-effective payment options to nearly , parking customers.Both APCOA and NCPS see this as a real opportunity to broaden the strength of services to clients and to improve capabilities by bringing together the best knowledge, systems and operational practice. Kim Challis, regional managing director for APCOA UK  Ireland, said: “The businesses complement each other well across dferent geographies and business sectors and both have strong management and operational teams.  “There are opportunities to share innovation and technology solutions from both companies across the whole business, and also to benefit from the on-going investment and business experience that comes from APCOA UK  Ireland being part of a larger European group. We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business. Combine those factors with the wide range of services and innovative technology we can offer, the possibilities for further growth in Northern Ireland look very strong indeed.”  Philippe Op de Beeck, chief executive of APCOA Parking Group, says the company “profited from healthy organic growth last year”. “In addition, we are currently strengthening our focus on strategic acquisitions.“The group recently acquired Onepark A S in Denmark, after having bought another smaller Swiss company early last year. With every acquisition, we have pursued a clear strategy: not to become a property owner. Thanks to its consistent ‘asset light’ business model, APCOA has established itself as a reliable partner, maximising the value of both private and public property owners’ assets. “At the same time, APCOA offers consumers a range of products and services that are increasingly digital and that span the entire market.” These acquisitions have enabled APCOA to expand its presence in each market and position itself for further profitable growth.
