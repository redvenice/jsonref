She is very good at it. Everyone involved with her initiative at Smart Works, a small charity that helps disadvantaged women get into the workplace, was immensely impressed by her input. Her contribution went well beyond making a token appearance and showing an interest. She came up with the idea of designing and selling product to raise funds and profile and gave an inspiring speech without notes at the launch.This is a woman who knows what she can achieve and what she is worth. As Meghan Markle, B-list actress in a successful TV series, that calculation was relatively straightforward.         One of the aspects of Royal life Meghan will have found most difficult is not being allowed to voice an opinion, writes ALEXANDRA SHULMAN (Meghan during her and Harry\u0027s secret visit to the Hubb Community Kitchen in west London)For Harry, as Duke of Sussex and sixth in line to the British throne, there was similar clarity. But as second-tier Royals roaming the world on the speaker circuit, making red-carpet appearances, endorsing products and occasionally appearing on the balcony at Buckingham Palace, the rules of engagement become very murky. Right now the Sussexes are hot.Meghan is beautiful and impassioned. Harry still dashing and a frontline Royal. Things change. In the world of celebrity, you are always having to watch out for the new kid on the block. Fame is a greedy beast that has to be continually fed.Until now, their working life of Royal tours, walkabouts, visiting disaster zones and being guests of honour at charity events has automatically fuelled and burnished their profile. But without the very special imprimatur of first-tier Royalty, the kind of power and influence they currently enjoy may not survive in the long term – especially if they are cashing them in to gain financial independence.The celebrity circuit is complex and quite brutal. If you become known as an easy gun for hire to the highest bidder, in a short time your currency drops. You can spend a few years giving hugely lucrative speeches for international hedge-fund dinners, and being on the advisory board of a bioersity start-up in Qatar, but to give this existence longevity you have to keep replenishing your worth – whether that is in the degree of your fame or in exceptional talent or knowledge.         Meghan is beautiful and impassioned. Harry still dashing and a frontline Royal, writes ALEXANDRA SHULMAN (Meghan and Harry during their secret visit to the Hubb Community Kitchen in west London)Unanchored celebrity has a built-in obsolescence. It’s hard to understand why they are swapping a profile that confers automatic and eternal worldwide fame for one where your worth will be in part measured by your number of Instagram followers and dependent on the skill of your marketing team.This kind of celebrity is also reliant on exposure, and not simply the exposure that you selectively chose to put out on your own social media sites. The relentless commentary of media of every kind is part of the deal and, if anything, the Sussexes may well be less protected in this new world than they felt in their old. Every move they make will be analysed and scrutinised and if they are being paid handsomely for it, they will no doubt be regarded as fair game.This weekend Meghan is back in Canada with her son while Harry is at home hammering out the details of their future. I hope he has some time out and manages to catch up with old friends.The couple are no doubt exhilarated by having made the decision to cut loose and get their plans out in the open. Almost certainly, they will be looking at the future and see it glittering with opportunity. Which it could be. If they don’t take their position for granted.But if they are hoping to build a new life that trades on royalty without fulfilling the more difficult obligations that come with it, which is reliant on the toxic mirage of fame without worth, not that many years down the line they could be looking at a very different picture."},{"url":null,"title":"The vicious rivalry Meghan Markle Kate Middleton super fans","story":"Share this article ‘The QUEEN is also off limits as are the York girls.’On the other side, there is equal vehemence. One member of The Sussex Squad wrote: ‘Kate Middleton is a creepy woman for wearing everything Diana used to wear, trying to win sympathy by using her dead mother-in-law – scary. Zero personality.

Kate is pictured above on her birthday earlier this weekUnsurprisingly, it is seen differently by Meghan’s devotees. They view the decision as empowering, an Independence Day for the couple – a sign, perhaps, of The Sussex Squad’s more transatlantic community. ‘It’s a huge decision,’ says one fan, addressing the couple. ‘But you are both strong enough to follow your dreams and I admire your choice.’Bella, 20, from Liverpool, who runs Instagram accounts dedicated to both Royal women, says drawing comparisons ‘comes with the territory’. ‘Her Majesty and Princess Margaret were always compared, as were Fergie and Diana and even Pippa and Kate,’ she said.‘The fact that Kate and Meghan are both beautiful, intelligent women doesn’t help, as people always want to criticise everything they do and say. It’s foolish to compare them because they’re completely different and independent people. I think they’re both inspirational in their own ways.’That may be so.

Based just off Broadway Market, it supports practitioners in a variety of disciplines, from visual artists to musicians to theatre companies. Not long after setting it up in 2008, I decided I wanted to make the project international. As I have roots in Nigeria, and the creative scene there is so exciting, Nigeria seemed like the right place to do it.About eight years ago, I acquired some land in Lagos. Now we’re in the process of building a residency in Lekki, a rapidly developing area in the east of the city. It will house three artists at a time, with studio and gallery spaces on the ground floor, and residents’ bedrooms above.The project also extends to a 30-acre farm in Ijebu, three hours northeast of Lagos. We’re in the process of landscaping and building a barn house and studios for artists, using sustainable materials such as mud, as well as a walled garden where people can learn about indigenous plants. Lagos is a very busy urban area with a lot of nightlife and music, so Ijebu will be for artists who need a more quiet space to produce work on a larger scale (there also will be a sculpture garden on the farm).The Guest Artists Space (G.A.S.) Foundation, as the new project is called, will be a two-way exchange. International visitors will be able to offer advice and support to local artists, but they will also receive knowledge. There’s so much to learn in Africa, and so many amazing artists and intellectuals, and the project spaces will provide a platform for exchange, for debate, for collaboration. There will be opportunities for visitors to work alongside African artists, to debate alongside them, to explore work, and leave with a completely different perspective. I’ve done residencies myself in the past and I always come back with a changed view of the world.African artists have always been there, doing fantastic work, and the rest of the world is only just catching up. When I was growing up in Nigeria in the 1970s, the music scene was incredible, thanks to artists such as Fela Kuti, and culture was very much part of my early experience. The arts suffered under the military regime in the 1980s and 90s, but Nigeria is more democratic now and the liberal arts are thriving again. The city has the Art X Lagos art fair, which draws collectors and artists from around the world. The middle class is growing and people have more disposable income. And there is still so much untapped potential. I see what’s happening in Nigeria and across the continent as a kind of African renaissance.As well as facilitating cultural exchange and giving artists a space to work in, I want this project to support the local ecosystem and economy. In Ijebu, I have employed 12 farm workers, installed five greenhouses (growing tomatoes, peppers and other vegetables) and planted two acres each of maize, plantain and cassava. The point of all this is to help develop food security and sustainability in an area where unemployment is high and food supply is precarious. Bringing people to the farm, for arts events as well as residencies, should also provide a boost for the local economy.There have been challenges along the way. I’ve learned that when you’re doing a building project, you have to be extremely patient with things like planning permission. And when you set up a foundation, you have to listen to the board of trustees. You can’t just go ahead and do things yourself, like you would in a studio.But the project is coming together. The farm is operational now and we should have the buildings and project spaces finished by the end of 2020. The building in Lagos will be ready by mid-2021 – I may launch it to coincide with the art fair in November that year. And we’ve got a very interesting, erse range of trustees on our board, including artists El Anatsui, Njideka Akunyili Crosby, and Olafur Eliasson.As with the space in London, the residencies in Nigeria will be multi-disciplinary, rather than focusing narrowly on visual arts. Each residency will last three months, but we also want to offer long-term support for inidual artists, equipping them to thrive not just survive, and I will be collaborating with other institutions and iniduals to achieve that.International exchange has a very strong value, especially in a world where there’s a great deal of conflict, and I believe that going to see other cultures, and being creative with other cultures, is really a very positive way forward. It can be a true vehicle for social change."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60aab80a6d2fba2dc38280a20a2c0546cb38192f/0_0_1700_2000/master/1700.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2fb02813737306a8bd41fc836a59a1b0 960w","title":"going local how to make a big difference in small ways","story":"For readers feeling anxious about the climate crisis, a fresh crop of nature writing is energising grassroots activism and inspiring local conservationConfronted by climate breakdown, the extinction crisis and rising inequalities, it is easy to feel anxious and hopeless. I feel those things, but in recent months I’ve also been heartened by a surge of grassroots action, of erse people responding in myriad ways to multiplying crises. To call it an ecosystem of resistance would be overly dramatic, but it is a flowering of good deeds and positive care for local neighbourhoods.In my blue corner of conservative Norfolk, traditionally slow to adopt national trends, I’ve encountered all kinds of inspiring work. The Norwich Soup Movement is one of four women-led volunteer groups providing hot suppers for the homeless every day of the week. Eves Hill Veg Co is a community market garden (again women-led), which trains people in horticulture and grows healthy fruit and veg for local people. Dandelion Education is an outdoor nursery and forest school with an enlightened focus on improving youth mental health, run by two brilliant former teachers. The Felbeck Trust is one of scores of new micro-local conservation groups seeking to restore wildlife.This explosion of local kindness is clearly a response to a need and a failure – of political institutions and mainstream charities to provide the basic building blocks of a good life. But does it have theoretical underpinnings? Are there books inspiring this new localism? Hannah Claxton, who quit her glamorous job in Damon Albarn’s management team to set up Eves Hill Veg Co – on land donated by a local farmer – cites Raj Patel’s book about the “world food system”, Stuffed and Starved, as a “massive influence” on her community garden. It is “the book I recommend to anyone trying to join up the dots about changing the way our food is grown and sold”, she says. Claxton’s project is also shaped by Vandana Shiva’s work in India and her books, such as Soil Not Oil, which demonstrate the importance of women working together. “Other books have described these ideas well,” Claxton says “but those two stand out as making me believe: ‘Yes, this is what I need to do.’”Claxton is in the vanguard of a market garden renaissance that is one response to the realisation that carbon-intensive industrial food production is bad for both consumers and producers. Another radical change is stirring larger landowners. The intensively farmed British countryside is set to be transformed more drastically than at any time since the 1970s: Brexit and the slashing of agricultural subsidies could bankrupt many farms.In Norfolk, two estates, Ken Hill and Somerleyton, are rewilding significant tracts of their land. They have been influenced by the unlikely 2018 bestseller Wilding by Isabella Tree. Few expected the story of a wealthy couple who inherited a 3,500-acre estate in Sussex to be the biggest nature writing success of the past 18 months, but Wilding has sold more than 150,000 copies and spawned a movement.“I’ve been completely amazed,” Tree says from her study at Knepp, the farm that she and her husband, Charlie Burrell, have radically transformed. “If I’d published this book six years ago, I don’t think it would have done anything. It just hit the moment.”Wilding tells of the collapse of their conventional mixed dairy farm, and how they auctioned off their farm machinery, rewilded their land and accidentally discovered a new model of farming. Nineteen years on, Knepp is challenging concepts from three millennia of farming such as “hedgerow”, “field” and “weed”, as well as conservation orthodoxies that we must “manage” land to help certain species. It is a profitable farm that also features an abundance of wildlife, including new (returned) species such as storks and beavers and rarities that are vanishing from everywhere else – from turtle doves to nightingales.Tree is now inundated with requests for help and talks. Knepp hosted 2,000 people on special “safaris” in 2017 this year it will host 6,000 31 farmers from the area around Knepp have signed up to join a neighbourhood “cluster group” to improve the wider landscape for nature. “The loveliest thing is that they are all responding to that message of hope. There’s so much eco-gloom out there, the feeling that we can actually turn things around is what people are grabbing on to … Great white egret flying over!” Tree interrupts herself, as she spots one of Knepp’s latest exciting arrivals.The first question she is always asked is a practical one: how can I rewild my landgardenbackyard? Tree thinks wilding can occur in tiny settings with the right interventions, and recommends Dave Goulson’s The Jungle Garden. She is now writing The Wilding Handbook to provide practical advice for everyone from big landowners to window-box owners.Nature writer Mark Cocker believes that Tree has started a movement. “Grassroots activism is breaking out beyond the confines of the establishment and it’s possible that Wilding is the one book that has catalysed it.” His own book, Our Place, published in 2018, tells the history of British conservation in the 20th century and ends with a powerful list of hard truths that society must confront if nature’s decline is to be reversed.Cocker is interested in what the plethora of new micro-local conservation groups reveals about mainstream conservation charities, many of which he thinks are now “irrelevant” to ordinary people who “actually want to be more emotionally identified with the action that takes place”. Charities such as the National Trust and the RSPB are “trapped by the size of their membership”, which makes them cautious. Even so, he believes they are still “very important because they are repositories for cumulative wisdom – they provide jobs and an outlet for members. They are channelling money in all the right directions but in terms of the needs of the moment, it’s a 16-year-old girl sitting outside her school in Sweden who is making the weather.”Neighbourhood conservation efforts other than the remarkable rise of Extinction Rebellion are often driven by volunteers who Cocker believes aren’t prepared to think globally or act “politically”. “They are very happy to act locally, but they fall away the moment anyone makes noises beyond the parapet of their village boundaries,” he says. Localism’s big challenge is to unite and form part of a global effort, he argues. Cocker wants the vast but disparate British environmental movement to come together in a “council of nature”, which could apply proper pressure to central government.For Rob Hopkins, the co-founder of the Transition Network, meaningful change is now most likely not at the centre but through local government. The Transition movement began in Hopkins’s home town of Totnes, Devon, in 2006, when people began sharing ideas of how to move from a carbon-based economy to a healthier, more sustainable community. Community change often begins with food. “You don’t need anyone’s permission around food. It’s not expensive. You just need people, tools and a deadline,” Hopkins says. In Totnes, “it’s been a fairly lonely furrow for a long time. Finally the surrounding world is starting to catch up a little bit.” Now that 245 local authorities across the UK have declared a climate emergency, which requires tough new carbon-reduction targets, councils will require the practical ideas of the Transition movement.In France, some local mayors have already instituted radical neighbourhood changes. The former mayor of impoverished Grande-Synthe near Dunkirk made all public transport free, created allotments around apartment blocks, and passed on to the poor savings made from converting to low-energy street lights. In Ungersheim in Alsace, the mayor Jean-Claud Mensch created a community solar farm, made all school food organic and created market gardens to grow that food. “This is a win- win-win-win-win,” Hopkins says. “Why doesn’t this happen everywhere? It’s good for everything – physical and mental health, schooling, the local economy, the neighbourhood. There is so much waiting to happen, if you can just get beyond these ‘yes, buts’ all the time.”There are two obvious “yes, buts” about burgeoning localism. One is that if iniduals devote all their energies to parochial concerns they won’t bring about national or international political change. If we do good deeds in our market garden or forest school, we’re not demanding systemic change: we’re letting Boris Johnson’s government get away with it. Another fear is that local action simply fulfils David Cameron’s vision of a “big society”, proving governments don’t have to provide essential local services or even a safety net instead we have the survival of the fittest communities.Hopkins argues that people don’t choose between community action or wider political activism. Lots of Transition Totnes folk have joined Extinction Rebellion the energy, he says, flows back and forth. “We really resisted the ‘big society’ quite vehemently. We can’t do business as usual and expect local people to run libraries. It’s not about communities doing things that governments should be doing. Transition groups really change the narrative about what’s possible, and do stuff governments could not do, wouldn’t imagine doing, wouldn’t dream of doing.”I have discovered through my own volunteering for a couple of forest schools that the best way to chase away anxiety and despair is to do something positive locally with other people – something that isn’t driven by money. As Hopkins says: “I’ve never been anywhere where anybody has said: ‘I was doing all right until I got involved in this Transition stuff,’ or: ‘I was doing all right until I learned to grow my own food.’ We are social creatures living in a time that is trying to stop us from being that. There’s something good for the heart about being involved in projects with other people.”• Patrick Barkham’s Wild Child, about children, nature and volunteering in forest schools, will be published by Granta in May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3beceb2842f644ad0e9ea1232a25e109e03067f1/0_546_4788_2873/master/4788.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7494b32a65643551d4475622548137c1","title":"avoid uk recession by kickstarting green economy says thinktank","story":"New Economics Foundation calls for £50bn to reboot economy on greener footingThe government fightback against the next recession should include pumping as much as £50bn into green projects, in a move that would help reboot the economy and tackle the climate emergency, according to a left-leaning thinktank.Against a backdrop of concern among economists that Britain is ill-equipped to combat another downturn on the scale of the 2008 financial crisis, the New Economics Foundation thinktank said a green plan to beat a future slump was required.Leading economists including former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers and the former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, Olivier Blanchard, have called on governments around the globe to prepare for future economic shocks with readily available blueprints to raise government spending.It comes as central banks, including the Bank of England, have limited capacity to provide support because interest rates remain close to the lowest levels on record more than a decade after the financial crisis. Mark Carney, the Bank’s governor, has hinted that Threadneedle Street could cut rates soon, while warning that it is running out of ways to combat recessions.The foundation said that raising investment in green infrastructure was required regardless of whether Britain was facing a recession or not. However, it said that a plan for fighting a future downturn should have decarbonisation at its core.Rolling out an expansive green spending round would help the government to avoid mistakes made responding to the last recession, the thinktank said, arguing that ministers missed an opportunity to decarbonise the economy following the 2008 slump.For a future spending package, it said the response should be spread over three years, with as much funding for green projects as possible made available in the first year to ensure the package has the most impact.Frank van Lerven, senior economist at the NEF, said: “The failure to respond to the last recession by scaling up investment to tackle environmental breakdown in a socially just way was a missed opportunity. And it’s an opportunity we cannot afford to miss again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78bd1a3dc6548f62a8bd0dc0ed9a3d2e288716b4/277_0_2889_1734/master/2889.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fed5f904a03910a8c1a68ffabaaf4d4","title":"polluting vehicles could be pulled from uk sale say carmakers","story":"New fines for breaches on CO2 limits will clash with Britons’ taste for higher-emission SUVsCarmakers could pull models from the UK, the automotive industry has warned, as the British taste for polluting vehicles clashes with the difficulty of meeting post-Brexit carbon dioxide limits.Under new EU rules, average carbon dioxide emissions of almost all cars sold in 2020 and 2021 across the single market, including the UK, must fall below 95g per kilometre, with major fines for those carmakers who miss inidual targets designed to meet the goal.That means that the heavier, fuel-guzzling SUVs favoured by Britons are offset by the smaller, less polluting cars preferred in countries such as Italy. After Brexit, when the UK plans to copy EU rules, this will no longer be the case, making a UK-only limit harder to hit.“It could be that you see a reduction in consumer choice through the removal of higher-emitting vehicles from not just the top end, but particular segments.”Carbon dioxide emissions of cars sold to British consumers rose for the third year in a row in 2019, underlining the scale of the challenge for the industry as it tries to meet the new EU limits.However, the prospect of an imminent Brexit at the end of January will force carmakers to make choices before the end of 2020, when the implementation period is scheduled to end and the UK-only limits kick in. That could include choosing to sell electric cars in the EU rather than the UK if they judge Europe to be a more important market.Carmakers are rushing to bring to market new electric cars with zero tailpipe emissions – including Volkswagen’s ID.3, Vauxhall’s Corsa-e and an electric Fiat 500this year – but production will initially be limited as factories gear up. At the same time, they are keen to hang on to their profitable but polluting sales of internal combustion engines.Al Bedwell, analyst at car consultancy LMC Automotive, said he expected some higher-polluting models to be withdrawn from sale across both the EU and the UK in the next two years.However, he added that major efforts to increase sales of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) may not work in the absence of consumer demand.“You can’t suddenly create a perfect environment to sell enough BEVs to make the problem go away,” he said.The Department for Transport said: “Our priority is to protect everyone from unsafe vehicles, including those that are damaging our environment, which is why we continue to work with industry to improve the emissions standards of all vehicles.“We have set out bold plans for driving down CO2 emissions and committed in our ‘Road to Zero’ strategy to pursue vehicle emissions regulation that is at least as ambitious as the current arrangements as we leave the EU.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13e37efcd3c0612e5f6ce9705e5981ccee706f60/0_0_3339_2456/master/3339.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=83f27cadaf4e9706fc48682eaf8efbd3 1760w","title":"guardian cities farewell from the editor","story":"In six years  Cities has grown into a community of journalists, experts and readers joined by a desire to make cities better. Now it’s time for a changeSince its founding six years ago,  Cities has grown from a small experiment into a huge community. Together – as editors, writers, photographers and film-makers, along with architecture experts, urban planners, gentrification activists, cycling evangelists, canalboat dwellers, homeless people, theatre-makers, refugees and the rest of a motley crew of contributors and readers from nearly 600 cities – we have tried to shape how the world understands urbanisation: namely, as one of the truly transformative global phenomena of the 21st century.We started  Cities because we saw that everywhere on Earth, people were flooding into cities. More concrete was poured in the last couple of years in China than the US used in the entire 20th century. China now has 100 cities with more than 1 million people, while some developing megalopolises in Africa and elsewhere may hit 80 million residents the 100 million city is no longer a fantastical proposition. Most of this growth has been largely unplanned, with people literally building their own houses and roads – though what some consider slums are really just the roots of new neighbourhoods.The challenges can seem overwhelming. The new desirability of cities has seen millions of poorer residents kicked out of their homes, sometimes literally bulldozed for expensive apartment towers. Air pollution from cars, particularly diesel engines (sold to us as safer, and only now revealed as the opposite), chokes many streets, hurting children in particular. The climate crisis threatens us with overheating and floods. Poverty remains a scourge. The concretisation of our environment can, if we’re not vigilant, cut us off from the natural world, turning vibrant human societies into bloodless mechanised economies.But if cities are places of great inequality and tumultuous change, they are also hives of innovation – to paraphrase Homer Simpson, both the cause of, and solution to, so many of our problems. Ignore the haters: cities writ large are safer, healthier and more productive than any other form of human habitation. Despite the rise of the internet, it remains in cities where people are best able to gather, exchange ideas and test out solutions. We are rewilding, cycling, densifying and in some cases even floating. In five years Copenhagen may become the world’s first carbon-neutral city. Tolerance and difference are at their highest in cities. They certainly aren’t for everyone, but more people can live together in cities, with less total impact, than in any other form of habitation.Our journalism has tried to tell these stories in many ways. Our pioneering “live week” concept took us to the world’s great megacities: Mumbai, São Paulo, Mexico City, Moscow, Tokyo, Jakarta. We have looked at how we live now asked great living artists to show us their cities looked at cities as they might have been and illustrated the surprising ways they actually are. We’ve profiled the living and the dead, traced the story of cities back 6,000 years, celebrated the most important buildings and exposed privately owned public space. We’ve tried to reinvigorate photojournalism, made films, published long reads, designed interactives, sailed canal boats, hosted live events and told jokes.2019 was a particularly vibrant year for us. Our  Concrete Week series on the evils of cement won the Foreign Press Association Award for Environment and Science. The empty doorway, our series of profiles of the lives of people who died homeless, took home the British Journalism Award for Features, and our revelation of the segregated playgrounds scandal was nominated for Campaign of the Year. We earned several other awards for our cycling and mobility coverage and the illustrated city series. We published our first print supplement, the Canal Revolution, in collaboration with the lovely folks at the Observer, and made a global documentary series, on ided cities. Last but not least I’ve hosted a podcast, launching shortly, about the songs that shaped cities at crucial moments in their history.Now, however, it’s time for a change. After many years of renewed generosity from the Rockefeller Foundation, whose arms-length support meant that we retained full editorial independence in every way, Cities is closing its doors. As an exclamation point, Cities will conclude this week with something we have generally avoided: expressing some forceful opinions, outright. We have normally focused as much as possible on original reported journalism, telling the stories of how the lives of citizens are changing, using their own words. But now we will make the case for five big, ambitious interventions that we think could improve cities for the better. Please read them. Tell us if you agree with them. We want these declarations to stand as an encouragement for new efforts to help further the cause of improving our cities, and for other journalists to take up the ever-fascinating story of our cities.In the meantime, I’d like to thank our staff, who have collectively made Cities what it was: my inspiring predecessor Mike Herd, who defined the site so profoundly we take his vision for granted perceptive deputy editor Nick Mead ebullient production editor Tash Reith-Banks (originator of the wonderful illustrated city series) the talented commissioning and community editor Claire Burke our indefatigable photo editor Jo Blason and our US editor-at-large Mark Oliver, an island of sanity. Particularly brilliant former desk editors have included Elle Hunt (I strongly recommend her terrific feature on Vienna), Francesca Perry, Marta Bausells, Athlyn Cathcart-Keays, Basia Cummings, Rory Lewarne, Naomi Larsson and Saptarshi Ray. We also couldn’t have done Cities without our colleagues on other  desks – chiefly Jamie Wilson, a hugely supportive international news editor who really helped us define how Cities could help further the ’s core editorial mission as well as our sharp-eyed head of photography, Fiona Shields Upside and Membership and all-round ideas man Mark Rice-Oxley editor of philanthropic projects Tracy McVeigh the giant  US and Australia editors John Mulholland and Lenore Taylor deputy editor Owen Gibson, who helped chaperone our segregated playgrounds campaign and  editor Katharine Viner for all the encouragement.A special shout-out must go to the ’s unparalleled Foundations team, led by powerhouse Rachel White her predecessor Ben Hicks, who masterminded the deal that created  Cities and Eleanor Clark, an absolute rock for us here in London. There are too many incredibly gifted writers to thank, but three stood out: Oliver Wainwright, the closest  Cities has come to speaking in a single voice Harriet Grant, whose tireless reporting led to our most tangible real-world impact, the banning of segregated playgrounds and Jon Watts, who didn’t just write the best piece  Cities has ever published, but was always generous with time, ideas, advice and support. Last but not least, a huge thank you to our multimedia executive producer Jess Gormley, an honorary Cities member if ever there was one and who, along with the gifted young producer Anetta Jones and soon-to-be-too-famous-for-us-to-hire director Max Duncan, created the outstanding Divided Cities, which stands proudly as our final, and best, documentary series.Above all, however, the site was made by you – and I don’t mean that figuratively. Your comments, opinions, suggestions and criticisms helped inform and shape our coverage. You helped us find and expose segregated housing, tipped us off to egregious examples of pseudo-public space, took over our Instagram feed, competed for the best urban ideas in your hometowns, shouted out questions and opinions at our live events, even boarded our canal boat. Or you just read us. For that, above all, we are hugely grateful."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b7db4a8e190384b6c79b477e518d3455120ccbb/0_187_3799_2280/master/3799.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecfa89055378a59251b7772ede5fd526","title":"lost seat parliament westminster britain working class","story":"If two years in Westminster taught me anything, it’s that the privileged few still decide the future of Britain’s working classWhat a difference a year makes. At the end of 2018 I had just won an MP of the Year award – by New Year’s Eve 2019, I had lost a job that I loved. A week to pack up the parliamentary office, up to two months to wind up the constituency office, and then the absolute worst part: making my amazing staff redundant.You can’t get away from the instability of politics. Democracy rightly gives us the ability to remove politicians from positions of power. In a marginal seat such as mine – Crewe and Nantwich – the situation was always going to be more precarious.There is a common misconception that all MPs have bags of money and receive huge payoffs if they lose their seat. Like many colleagues who lost their seats, I don’t have a family fortune or lots of friends in high places. When I attended an appointment at my local jobcentre last week, a few people were shocked to see me there. One even took a photograph on their phone.I am working-class. When the work stops, the money stops, and a new source of income must be found. I’m not embarrassed to be in my situation – I have two kids and two pensioners who live with me and I have a responsibility to provide for them. It’s not easy being out of work so suddenly but I don’t regret anything. I have been incredibly lucky to have had the opportunity to be an MP, something I will always be grateful to the people of Crewe and Nantwich for.When I first ran for parliament, in 2017, I was very much the underdog. Described at the time in a somewhat misogynistic way as a “shrill local critic” of the sitting Conservative MP, I was actually just a strong and outspoken representative of my community. I was a working mother, a local school cuts campaigner and an ex-teacher with an axe to grind about the impact austerity was having on my community.I was fed up with politicians being so detached from reality. Some friends were being made redundant, while others were scraping by to pay for childcare to enable them to work. A colleague who was a teaching assistant confided in me that she was having to use the food bank. I was angry – and frankly still am. I had also come to the conclusion that politics isn’t some faraway thing that other people do, but a thing that affects everything about our lives – and so the only way to change the fortunes of my people was to get involved. That’s why I stood for election. Parliament needed more voices like mine.When I was elected, one of the things that made me so overjoyed was that now all these people had someone like them to fight for what they needed. I would be their voice in Westminster. My experience would also be proof that if I could do it, others like me could as well. I refused to let the snobbery in parliament bother me and I spoke up for what I believed in. Any feeling of impostor syndrome I might have had was pushed to the back of my mind.If we truly want our political system to work and people to be more engaged, then it is vital that we have more representatives who understand the daily existence of the average person. Even now I’m out of office I won’t stop fighting for my area and the people that I love. I would encourage anyone with a burning desire for change to now throw themselves into the fight. If my two years in parliament has taught me anything, it’s that we can’t let the privileged few determine our future.• Laura Smith is the former Labour MP for Crewe and Nantwich"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ab47efa5f2284dbc241fe2dc0985827feab1b9e/0_280_5023_3014/master/5023.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c4cdef4fa2907240ab3d2e0c5896e7a9","title":"britain racism media harry meghan","story":"This week there is a very special guest in the pantomime – Meghan. Has her treatment in Britain been marked by racism? Oh no it hasn’t! Oh yes it has! The cast assume their positions. On one side of the stage, black and brown people are summoned to perform their parts in the pantomime – with frustration, disbelief, even tears. In the middle are the mediators, the TV and radio programme hosts – earnest, but clinically, unrelentingly goading. On the other side of the stage, the professional race-baiters, the red-tops, the “journalists”, the online trolls elevated to respectability once again, and Piers Morgan. There is always Piers Morgan.Britain’s conversation about race endlessly repeats itself, first as tragedy, and for ever thereafter as farce. Instead of discussing race relations in this country through the issues of hate crime, systemic police prejudice and the dramatic disparity of opportunity between people of different ethnic backgrounds, we have decided to debate it by constantly arguing about whether it is relevant. Because things are so much better than they used to be, aren’t they?In many ways, any improvement in race relations has come with a proportional decline in self-awareness, and with it a degradation of the public conversation on race. The increased visibility of black and brown people in those spaces where this conversation takes place – in politics and the media – has achieved little apart from sifting them into for and against camps. Whenever a public figure is subjected to racist behaviour, a sort of kangaroo court is set up, one with an impossibly high bar for proving a racist event has occurred – anything short of an explicit slur or a violent attack can easily be explained away. The outcome of the litigation is certain because the whole point of the exercise is the spectacle, rather than the inquiry. It’s a set-up.The subjects of the spectacle are not chosen by accident. As a nation, we love a celebrity racism row, and the media is happy to play both sides: everyone loves to read about celebrities, and it’s easy work to tear down someone young, famous and wealthy for claiming to be a victim of racism. In fact, it is this cherrypicking of the most prominent figures that guarantees that the national conversation about race is erted into one about privilege.The chosen protagonists – the princess, the pop star, the TV presenter, the politician – ensure that the conversation is never really about racism. Confining our attention to elite victims conveniently shrinks the subject to something neat and quick: it can be packaged into a short viral video, a highly quotable column that is basically an extended tweet, a studio shouting match that will light up social media.There will be no time to discuss the laziness, complicity and complacency of a media class that has turned racism into a spectator sport. There will be no time to discuss the unique toxicity of tabloid culture, and why it thrives in the UK. There will be no time to discuss the large swathes of a deeply conservative country that are goaded and taunted by a cultural showreel from the metropolis that inflames and excludes them.There will be no time to talk about the rightwards creep of our political culture under successive Tory governments that have consistently turned up the dial on nativism. There will be no time to position these elite victims as central characters in a culture war led by the right – one that has weaponised the word “woke” to discredit any efforts, or even gestures, towards social justice. There will be no time for anything but performance.And in the performance, behind a mask of innocent inquiry, the same old interrogation – which pretends to ask about racism in Britain, but in fact only hopes to smoke you out in the open and then draw some blood. Look out. It’s behind you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b6b788ce741f17489ac27accd6e8c5e3a351f2b/0_291_4157_2495/master/4157.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c506a27a4ea8d9bb336bc4462aae6070","title":"metoo christine keeler bbc drama profumo women","story":"The BBC drama about the Profumo scandal upends the conventional narrative by offering us women’s perspectivesIn the second episode of the BBC drama The Trial of Christine Keeler, the voice of its eponymous heroine reflects on the liaison that came to define the sexual liberation era, and arguably brought down the Tory government. “We both gave in to the most natural human instinct of all,” she says, wryly. “The love of a powerful middle-aged man for a penniless teenage girl.”Keeler was 19 when she started sleeping with John Profumo, the 46-year-old married secretary of state for war, kicking off a scandal that would become a defining cultural landmark, as implacable in the historiography of the 1960s as Lady Chatterley and the Beatles. To those of us who are too young to have lived through it, our awareness of it was less keen: a collection of vaguely remembered names, an iconic photograph of a naked young woman straddling a knock-off Arne Jacobsen chair, a swimming pool and a stately home, something about Russia.As in the case of Monica Lewinsky, the scandal became reified in aspic, boiled down to a collection of symbols (a dress, the Oval Office, “that woman”). And as with Lewinsky, the centrifugal force in the whole mess was deemed to be an attractive young woman. A young woman who bore the brunt of the guilt and the shame, and whose subjectivity remained for many years notably absent, despite her attempts to tell her side of the story. Fourth-wave feminism and a post-#MeToo climate have undoubtedly opened up the space needed for a reappraisal. The Trial of Christine Keeler is written, produced and directed by women, and offers us the perspectives of the women involved at the time, who, it is plain to see, were categorically not pulling the strings.“The accepted narrative was that Christine was a call girl, a prostitute, a siren, a femme fatale,” the director, Andrea Harkin, told the Observer. “Yet the reality is that she was none of those things. Nor was she a helpless victim. She was complex and vulnerable and tough and damaged and brilliant.”Men never left Keeler alone. She was raped, harassed, stalked, manipulated, mocked and vilified, all by men. What’s most affecting about the series so far is the cumulative effect of this on a young woman from a deprived background who, as well as being ambitious and willing to sell her story to the tabloids for a quick buck, is horribly out of her depth, claustrophobically surrounded by powerful men and their bullish desires.For women of my generation and younger, the slut-shaming of Keeler, as with that of Lewinsky, should belong in a bygone era, and can be interpreted as part of a prevailing culture of victim-blaming that is underpinned by misogyny. Keeler’s vilification was also, the BBC drama makes clear, underpinned by racism (she had black lovers as well as white ones) and classism. As in Mad Men, the ways in which women are pestered, objectified and patronised are played straight, as par for the course, rendering them even more shocking for those of us who did not live through those times.There’s a phrase that I’ve heard older women use in discussions of the sexism they faced in their lives, during the course of the conversations between the generations that have often come about as a result of the Me Too movement. The phrase is: “That’s just the way it was.” It is not, as it is sometimes misinterpreted, a statement of resigned defeat, complacency, or even one of complicity. It is more an acceptance of the fact that a sexist culture was so prevalent, so deeply embedded, so stifling, that to challenge each and every incidence of harassment would be impossible, exhausting and fruitless. So many women just tried to get on with it, or even exploited it to their advantage. That suffocating atmosphere is alien to a woman of my age, though we have all choked on the vapours following in its wake.That’s not to say that the shaming of Keeler was sanctioned by her female contemporaries. The artist Pauline Boty’s missing painting of Keeler, entitled Scandal ’63, has become better known in recent years from its inclusion in Ali Smith’s 2016 novel Autumn. No one knows where it is, but it exists in photographs: look at the heads of the four men hovering above the naked Keeler Boty, also a young woman who was prized mainly for her looks, knew the score. Almost 60 years later, Dear Christine, an exhibition of work by female artists, builds on Boty’s attempt to reframe Keeler’s role. This, combined with the dramatisation, finally does Keeler some justice.It has been intensely moving to see Keeler offered the redemption that was granted much more prematurely to the men involved with her, and to see her given a fully rounded character rather than being reduced to the cardboard cutout of a tart (an actual headline at the time: “Keeler, The Shameless Slut”) who ruined a powerful man’s career, and, latterly, ageing paparazzi fodder for cruel tabloid media. Perhaps the reappraisal of Keeler is all the more moving for the reappraisals we have all been undertaking after #MeToo. I felt so terribly grownup as a very young woman, and sometimes acted as though I was. But the older men I was involved with? They knew that I wasn’t. I only really understand that now.That’s the power of female subjectivity. So often we are encouraged to imagine ourselves in the shoes of male protagonists, but how often are audiences encouraged to imagine themselves in the body of a 17-year-old girl self-administering an abortion using a pen because there is no legal way of terminating her pregnancy? A 17-year-old girl who somehow carried on and ended up shortly afterwards a cipher for the so-called liberation of an entire society, because she slept with a man who had power. These revisionist excavations of the past are timely and necessary. It’s an old, old story, but that doesn’t mean we have to keep telling it in the same way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b9c643b01b2903da31560a3333e549012be314d/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c66777e71ae10a2776d3c72034b001df","title":"preston labour woes localism brexit","story":"Since Labour’s resounding election defeat in December, it has become something of a truism to say the loss of its “heartlands” was many years in the making. Across the north and Midlands, the slow burn of mine closures and deindustrialisation left a decisive void in the party – not only in an economic sense, but also politically.As industry vanished so did the local unions, working men’s clubs and labour societies that once offered working people genuine opportunities for democratic participation. Brexit filled this space, offering people a version of the sense of identity, inclusion and control that Labour has since failed to create: some argue that the party’s attempt to replay and therefore counteract the referendum may have lost it the “working-class” vote for good.Yet this breezy homogenisation of the north and Midlands fails to take in the complex geography of Labour’s defeat. Why the party continues to thrive in some seats in the midst of heavy defeats elsewhere has barely been covered – a detail surely more important to Labour’s recovery than the endless self-flagellation encouraged by many politicians and commentators.Take Preston, a leave-voting bloc of the party’s now destroyed “red wall”, and a crumbled bastion of the “left behind” north – only this wilfully simplistic story does not hold. Under the guidance of the radical Labour councillor Matthew Brown, Preston has democratised its public institutions and invited people to participate in decision-making at all levels of the city’s economy. And guess what? Labour held the seat by a healthy margin.Although Labour’s share in Preston dropped a little from 2017, it retained much of the vote recovered under Jeremy Corbyn and was still higher than at any other point during the 21st century, while other Labour strongholds in Lancashire such as Heywood and Middleton turned blue for the first time – the culmination of a decline that began in 2005.In so many ways, Preston is indicative of the seats lost by Labour this election. After Margaret Thatcher came to power, the city could only watch as deindustrialisation tore through its democratic fabric. Consolidated under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown’s cosmopolitan, big city brand of Labourism, the party’s growing obsolescence soon became apparent: between 2001-11, Preston saw a stark decline in Labour’s share of the vote.Then, in 2011 – abandoned to austerity by the coalition government – Preston council decided to undertake a radical experiment, now known affectionately as the “Preston model”.The concept, based on the idea of community wealth building, has sought to create a collective and inclusive economy kept in the hands of the city’s inhabitants. Through worker co-ops, public enterprise, community land trusts and public planning initiatives, Preston council has not only jumpstarted the city’s economy, but turned a place emblematic of the ravages of neoliberalism into what one study calls “the most improved city in the UK”. These positive economic results translated into a boost at the ballot box for Labour at the 2015 election, and by 2017 the party had returned its share of the vote to the highest point since 1997.This should give pause for thought. Perhaps it wasn’t simply the nationalist tenor of Brexit that galvanised such ardent commitment from leave voters, but the sense of participation instilled by the vote itself. Labour can blame its loss on nationalist sentiment, rising populism and a hostile press – all of which have no doubt played an increasing role in British politics over the past four years. Or the party can focus on what Brexit continues to reveal: a gulf in political participation waiting to be filled.While Brexit fills this gap in only the most superficial ways, Preston shows how communities can have genuine political agency. Extending autonomy to local institutions, devolving decision-making to the grassroots, cultivating engagement in civic life at the local level – what would this look like on a national scale? This is the question that Labour must answer over the next five years.Crucially, Labour does not need to be in national government to make this happen in towns across the country – it just requires bold local councillors who are willing to venture into new territory. Not only does Labour still run many local administrations, but further cuts under Boris Johnson may actually offer an incentive for councils to move to the direct and radical forms of localism that Preston has pioneered.If continued austerity makes radical local government an attractive option, then the climate crisis makes it an urgent necessity. To stand a chance of mitigating disaster, a green industrial revolution can’t wait for a Labour government in five or 10 years it must begin now in local communities. This would involve, for instance, the development of communally controlled renewable energy, which would allow people around the country to fully partake in the green movement as opposed to being bystanders.It will be no mean feat to revitalise a culture of participation in the places which have been left to build their futures from the scrapheap of 20th-century capitalism. But this is what Labour must do – or face decades in the wilderness as the right continues to capitalise on the alienation and despair that led so many to vote to leave the EU.While constituencies all around them were being lost, Preston remained red in December because, as one Labour councillor said, the city is genuinely taking back control. Preston shows that where Labour cultivates participatory democracy it can still win – it must now do this on a far larger scale.• Phil Jones is a research affiliate at the Autonomy thinktank"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d27ae32668c426dd911b376845b13ce465ccc9cd/0_301_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7949c61cadb8936642f78f0417df2288","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of peace","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘peace’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘peace’.Share your photos of what peace means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 15 January at 10am.

It is increasingly common sense on UK campuses that these companies can play no productive role in solving the climate crisis.”Saltmarsh warned that those institutions that held out against estment would be harshly judged by history.“Universities not yet ested can now choose to stand with their students on the right side of history or be forever known as complicit in the crimes of climate breakdown.”In the past year a flurry of major academic institutions – from University College London to York University – have pledged to est completely. However several major universities, including Cambridge, are still subject to vociferous campaigns by students and staff over their links to the fossil fuel industry.A  investigation last year revealed that just 20 fossil fuel giants are linked to a third of all the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving the climate crisis.And as awareness of the industry’s role in the climate crisis has grown, it has come under growing pressure in the UK with leading arts institutions facing calls to end their sponsorship deals and protesters targeting inidual companies.Saltmarsh said: “Wildfires are wreaking destruction across Australia, the Amazon and beyond while fossil fuel companies profit from the extraction to blame for this devastation. Excluding this industry from our universities is now a mainstream and majority position.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c468cff654c4d43c7e478960ad6a3e12f731743/59_0_1803_1082/master/1803.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b08e46a0f54fc8a5b0a8e5cfe25dba2","title":"like a bomb going off why brazils largest reserve is facing destruction aoe","story":"Gold prospectors are ravaging the Yanomami indigenous reserve. So why does President Bolsonaro want to make them legal?Deep in the Yanomami indigenous reserve on the northern reaches of the Brazilian Amazon, the ruins of an illegal goldminers’ camp emerge after an hour in a small plane and two in a boat. No roads reach here.Wooden frames alongside the Uraricoera River that once supported shops, bars, restaurants, a pharmacy, an evangelical church and even brothels are all that is left of the small town. The army burned and trashed it as part of an operation aimed at stamping out wildcat mining on the reserve. The army may have taken away the town, but they left the garimpeiros, as the miners are called, who this morning are hunched around a freezer, waiting for the soldiers camped downriver to leave so they can get back to work. Up to 20,000 garimpeiros are estimated by Brazilian NGO Instituto Socioambienta to have invaded this reserve, where mining and unauthorised outsiders are currently prohibited. But the garimpeiros may not remain unauthorised for long: the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, has promised to legalise their work with a bill in Congress.“I know it is illegal,” says Bernardo Gomes, 59, sitting by the frame of a bar. Formerly a worker at mining giant Vale, Gomes says his time at the company taught him how to protect the environment. “Today, unfortunately, I am helping to destroy it,” he says, explaining that a nearby patch of dead trees was suffocated by mud sucked out of the nearby mining pit.Some of his companions decline to talk, including a young woman who arrives carrying a bottle of whiskey and a speaker playing pop music. “Want a photo? Naked?” she jokes.In eight days reporting from different locations in the Yanomami reserve, the  saw numerous mining pits and barges. Camps and bases had been destroyed along the Uraricoera – but its banks still teemed with outsiders.With 9.6m hectares (23.7m acres) of wild forest – an area bigger than Portugal – Yanomami is Brazil’s largest reserve. A fifth of its indigenous population died from diseases after 40,000 garimpeiros flooded the reserve in the 1980s, according to Survival International. The miners were expelled and the area declared a reserve in 1992 following a campaign by Survival, photographer Claudia Andujar and Davi Kopenawa, director of the Hutukara Yanomami Association, which invited the  to visit the reserve.But the current garimpeiro invasion worsened after Bolsonaro took office. The president has said the reserve is too big for its population of around 26,000 indigenous people, and its mineral riches should be exploited. His ministers have met garimpo leaders.But garimpeiros bring malaria, prostitution and violence, indigenous leaders argue, while scientists say the mercury the miners use to separate gold particles from mud and silt enters rivers and the food chain. Their pits and barges upset ecosystems, scare away wildlife, and fill rivers with mud that distorts fish behaviour and breeding.Indigenous people used to call this upriver region Paixão de Mutum – or Curassow’s Passion – after the large, pheasant-like bird they hunted here. Now it is known as Tatuzão – Big Armadillo – for the pits that miners have gouged out of the forest. Miners have replaced the mutum.Funai, the national agency which works to protect indigenous lands, plans to reopen three bases in the reserve. But repeated army operations have failed to shift the miners.Just a few minutes upriver from the ruined camp, work has already resumed in an enormous mining pit, where tarpaulin and scaffolding made of logs and twine hold up a bank of earth. Three men toil waist-deep in mud with a hose jetting water under an uprooted tree. Mud pours down a rough wooden sluice, while black smoke belches from a deafening diesel engine: a hand-operated industrial hell amid the wild tropical beauty.“We are here to get gold. These are our riches,” says garimpeiro Fredson Pedrosa, 40. “Everyone here is counting on the army leaving so they can work again.”The men are from small towns in Brazil’s impoverished north and north-east, where they say minimum-salary wages of around US$250 a month (£194) are barely enough to live on. “You do this to keep your family,” says Denilson Nascimento, 33.Garimpeiros say they voted for Bolsonaro after he promised to legalise their trade. “We know it damages the environment,” says Antonio Almeida, 24, who runs a bar here. “But there is a lot of nature, no way you can kill it all.”Wildcat mining is deeply entwined with local life in Waikás. Four villagers work as boatmen for the miners, others sell food at Tatuzão and two run a smaller mining site nearby. Tolls on the garimpo boats paid for generators, boat motors and televisions.“The garimpo is a reality and they’re used to it,” says Edmilson Estevão, 33, who was raised in the village and works for the Ye’kwana association Wanasseduume. Some villagers work with the mining, others reject it, but the Ye’kwana keep their differences to themselves. “Same family, same blood,” he says.The garimpo has impacted heavily on hunting, fishing and water quality. “The prey is getting further and further away. Fish are disappearing, and are contaminated with mercury,” says Júlio Ye’kwana, 39, Wanasseduume’s president. “Wild pigs used to live around the village. Not anymore.”When mining in the Tatuzão area was operating at full pelt, the river where children bathe and families collect water thickened with mud. “The water was very dirty,” says Nivaldo Edamya, 34, the village chief. “What garimpo does is bad. Deforestation, various diseases, that’s why I am against them.”Academic research on the impacts of garimpo – or Artisanal and Small Scale Gold Mining (ASGM) – on bioersity backs up these complaints.Marcelo Oliveira, a conservation specialist at the World Wildlife Fund has found high mercury levels in fish as far as 150km from ASGM sites in the Amazon. He and other researchers found mercury in Amazon river dolphins – nearly half of those studied had dangerously high levels – and other researchers found record mercury levels in jaguar fur near ASGM sites in the Brazilian Pantanal. “This is an invisible problem,” he says.Birds and larger mammals are sensitive to changes in forest cover and vegetation and flee garimpo areas, says David Lutz, a US-based research assistant professor in environmental studies at Dartmouth College who has studied ASGM in the Peruvian Amazon for a decade. “Massive disturbance. This is like a bomb going off. This is as drastic as you’ll see,” he says, after viewing photos of Tatuzão.A study carried out by Lutz and colleagues in Peru found water quality was severely impacted near ASGM sites. Mud and silt thickened rivers, reducing visibility, which would disturb seasonal behaviour and even the breeding habits of fish and the life cycles of insects. “There is a handful of species that can handle this change, so those species become dominant and it lowers the numbers of other species,” says Lutz.Near Waikás, two rough-hewn wooden barges used to dredge for gold are hidden in a tributary. Banks of sand, stones and mud sucked up by the barges had formed in the river. “They are reshaping the river structure,” says Lutz. “This will really change the sediment.”In the 1980s and 1990s, William Milliken, an ethnobotanist at Kew Gardens documented the impacts in Yanomami areas degraded by ASGM, such as disappearing caiman and a reduction in plants such as fish poison vine. “It’s likely to happen again,” he said.The mercury that miners use to separate gold particles from mud and silt is dumped into rivers and burned off into the air, says Luis Fernandez, a tropical ecologist and director at the Wake Forest University centre for Amazon Scientific Innovation in the US.Mercury spreads into the aquatic ecosystem via a process called biomagnification and concentrates rapidly as it passes up the food chain. “The food chain acts like a signal amplifier,” he says. “Environmental chemistry in the tropics is much faster than in temperate regions.”An hour’s flight across the rolling hills of jungle from Waikás – passing over a garimpo pit and camp with its own vegetable garden – brings you to the health post at Maloca Paapiú. The Yanomami people it serves live in communal houses of extended families deep in thick forest, reached by muddy, winding trails. Here, men and women use black and red face and body paint and women wear short skirts of fronds, bamboo spears in their noses and cheeks barefoot children skip nimbly across the slippery logs that serve as bridges across numerous streams and rivers.Garimpeiros overran the region in the late 1980s. Now they are inching closer again. Noemia Yanomama, 40, says she saw a garimpo camp near the hills where she hunts. She worries young indigenous men will bring sexual diseases from prostitutes in the camps. “Soon they will get close to the community. That makes me very sad,” she says.Young men and teenage boys gather daily at the health post to charge cellphones they bought working on garimpo sites reached by hours of walking. One site abandoned this year was just a few hours away.This is creating a generational ide with their parents, who still hunt with bows and arrows. “The garimpo is not our friend. We call it a disease,” says Tibiana Yanomama, 42.His son Oziel, 15, escaped to the nearest garimpo with his friend Marcos, 21. Both spent three weeks working there, clearing jungle, before Tibiana went and dragged them back.“I wanted shoes, a machete, a sharpening file,” Marcos says. “I wanted a hammock. I wanted to work.” He was paid five grams of gold (worth around $180). He saw garimpeiros working with mercury and drank beer and sugar cane rum. “I got very drunk,” he says, with a nervous laugh.Tibiana is furious with Oziel. “The youth don’t listen,” he says. And he is livid with Bolsonaro’s plans to legalise garimpo. “What does he want for Brazil? This forest is Brazil,” he says. Oziel caught malaria, a recurrent problem in garimpo camps, where pools of waste water provide breeding grounds for mosquitos. The Maloca Paapiú health post handles 15 new cases a week.For the Yanomami, nature and spirituality are intrinsically linked: every rock, every waterfall, every bird, every monkey has a spirit, says Maneose Yanomama, 55, shaman of the Sikamabi-U community. And the spirits of nature are sounding the alarm. “The whites are getting closer. They are damaging our land, they are destroying our rivers, they are ruining our forests,” he said. “Nature is very scared.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3eb8339ba3db4486cd6d676aff243a3925390226/0_133_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c80a911f4d1498a1ec9ed6bd55a6843","title":"arsenal brighton wsl van de donk","story":"Two goals each from Beth England and Ji So-yun helped Chelsea come from behind against Bristol City and secure an emphatic 6-1 victory in the Women’s Super League on Sunday. City’s 18-year-old forward Ebony Salmon scored in her third consecutive game to give them an early lead but Chelsea broke back in the 28th minute and cruised to the win with Hannah Blundell and Jess Carter both on the scoresheet.After all the hype of a golden boot shootout between the new Chelsea striker Sam Kerr and Arsenal’s Vivianne Miedema, both remained off the scoresheet for the second successive game since the Australian Kerr arrived in London. Arsenal, though, were untroubled by the lack of a goal from their talismanic forward as her Dutch compatriots Daniëlle van de Donk and Jill Roord and the England duo Jordan Nobbs and Beth Mead ensured a 4-0 defeat of Brighton.Emma Mitchell struck a curling effort from outside the penalty area to give Tottenham the lead over West Ham on the defender’s full debut having joined on loan from Arsenal for the remainder of the season. Kenza Dali levelled the score late on but Rianna Dean’s stoppage‑time header snatched all three points for Spurs.Amalie Eikeland scored the only goal in a hard-fought win over Birmingham to lift Reading up to fourth. Manchester United’s visit to Liverpool was postponed due to a waterlogged pitch. The Manchester City forward Pauline Bremer paid tribute to the patience of the departing Nick Cushing after her fourth double of the season helped them to a 3-1 defeat of Everton. The German forward Bremer joined City from the European champions, Lyon, in 2017 as part of a deal that took England’s Lucy Bronze to the French side but a nasty leg break after scoring on her debut and subsequent related injury problems led to her making only six appearances in two years.Cushing kept the faith, though, and on Saturday Bremer rewarded the manager with her eighth and ninth league goals of the season. “I’m really thankful,” said the 23-year-old of Cushing. “He’s the one who brought me to this club and to England and I’m really grateful for the opportunity. With my injury history I’m glad that he didn’t let me drop at any point and always believed that I could make it after a long time out.”Bremer believes she is almost back to her best and that the injury has helped her development. “I feel like the injury was a big challenge but it definitely helped me in many ways,” she said. “When I was younger I maybe went into tackles a bit blind but now I’m a lot more clever about it. Mentally as well, you have to be strong to overcome an injury. I know what it is like not to have football, so I’m just very grateful to be back on the pitch and training pitch.”The manager, who leaves City for the MLS side New York City FC after his team play Arsenal on 2 February, told the players he was leaving on Thursday. “It was quite a surprise for all of us,” said Bremer. “We thought we would finish the season with him but sometimes in football things can happen really quickly.” Quelling fears that it could disrupt the flow of the team, the Germany international added: “I think we can manage it definitely. We have great staff behind the squad as well, the assistant coach will take over. We all know how to play football.”Cushing agreed and backed the assistant manager, Alan Mahon, to lead the team through to the end of the season and potentially beyond. “He’s got the ability to take it for sure,” he said. “It’s whether he sees being a head coach as his future, it’s whether he feels he is ready. He will be brilliant for the team because he has good relationships with all the players, he’s got a great football knowledge, he’s played the game at the highest level, but this football club will look for the right person.”“OK, I’ve pushed them hard at times and maybe they’ve pushed me hard and we’ve fallen out and argued. There’s a million things I’ve loved about this job but probably the proudest thing is earning the respect of the players and hearing them say nice things about me now is a testament to the hard work we’ve all put in together.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14d4f23e3e527a5f2e3e61c1dd88c8076c1f33b2/0_190_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41fe3e313c7c2a8f13c8faff07244906","title":"barcelona managerial limbo xavi hernandez luis suarez","story":"Barcelona have been left in limbo after their former midfielder Xavi Hernández turned down an offer to take over as manager of the club.Barcelona’s sporting director, Eric Abidal, and chief executive, Òscar Grau, are due to discuss the next step with Josep Maria Bartomeu, the club’s president, upon their return from Qatar, where they held meetings with Xavi over two days. The 39-year-old, who is currently in charge of the Doha club al-Sadd, expressed a desire to become coach at the Camp Nou but with Barcelona pressing for a swift response he decided the time was not right. Ernesto Valverde remains in charge.Barcelona are now considering their options, which include handing the job on a part-time basis to the B-team coach, Francisco Javier García Pimienta, with a view to Xavi taking over in the summer.Until Barcelona were beaten 3-2 by Atlético Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup in Saudi Arabia on Thursday night, their original idea had been to see out the season with Valverde, with the former centre-back and current Netherlands head coach, Ronald Koeman, the principal candidate to replace him after Euro 2020, but that position has shifted now.Valverde had not been informed of the meetings and, unless a resolution is reached, he will turn up to take training on Monday. Last February he signed a new contract that runs to the end of this season with an option for another. No one anticipated that clause would be activated, but Valverde has no intention of resigning. Barça are through to the next round of the Champions League, having won their group, and are top of La Liga. They have also won the title in each of the last two seasons.Abidal and Grau had travelled to Qatar following Barcelona’s defeat on Thursday. From 2-1 up with eight minutes remaining, they were defeated 3-2. Although doubts over Valverde had been profound, Barcelona stuck with him in the summer, but that defeat – throughout which Saudi Arabian Barcelona fans booed him – brought reservations back to the surface. With Xavi saying no, and negotiations public, it would be difficult to take a step back now: Valverde’s position has been weakened dramatically.Grau and Abidal had been due in Qatar to check on the progress of the injured Ousmane Dembélé but they also met Xavi. That too was planned but, to his surprise, they offered him the manager’s job immediately. He told reporters it was no secret that his “dream” was to manage Barcelona, but hinted he had doubts over the timing. Xavi, who won eight La Liga titles and four Champions League during his 17-year career at Barcelona, also insisted on his “respect” for al-Sadd and Valverde. On Sunday, he finally turned the job down.The day that was expected to bring news of the end of Valverde’s career at Barça may instead have brought news of the end of Luis Suárez’s career there after the club announced he will be out for an estimated four months after he underwent surgery on the meniscus on his right knee.Suárez is 34 next month and Barcelona, who were already looking for a long-term replacement in the summer, are now considering going into the winter transfer market. Only four players have ever scored more goals for the club and before Thursday night’s match, Suárez had scored or assisted each of Barcelona’s last 10 goals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b18362211bdd65d82f6dffdd1d30b632a485ffd7/417_612_2262_1357/master/2262.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb9e0892f0fc8e5034713448384fa6ac","title":"manchester united ready to firm up interest in sportings bruno fernandes","story":"Manchester United are ready to firm up their interest in Bruno Fernandes, with the Sporting Lisbon midfielder keen on a move priced at around €70m (£60m).Ole Gunnar Solskjær has identified the 25-year-old as an option to strengthen a position depleted by the departures of Ander Herrera and Marouane Fellaini plus the long-term injury to Scott McTominay.While United have refused to comment on their expected approach for the Portugal international it is understood Sporting are braced for Fernandes to be sold to United.

No team has scored fewer goals in the Premier League this season and those front–foot displays of yesteryear – they scored almost 100 goals en route to promotion in 2015 and more than any team outside the top six last season – feel a distant memory following a ninth defeat in 11 league matches. “Historically we have always been free-scoring and we have always had goals in us,” their manager, Eddie Howe, said. “We have always had the ability – even if we have conceded first – to come back and win games. That is probably where the feeling has gone missing, the creativity and that feeling we are going to score. We have to do better in that respect.” Ben FisherAnother Liverpool win and another that led to praise for a host of players in red. Quite right too, but there should also be an appreciation of the display delivered by the man in black. Yet again Alisson was outstanding with his positioning and handling, playing as a sweeper on occasion while every shot that came his way was, as ever, held with minimum fuss. No Premier League goalkeeper has a better clean sheets percentage than Alisson this season (46), or has a higher save percentage (83.9). Since arriving from Roma for £66.9m in July 2018 the Brazilian has provided Liverpool with a calm, brilliant authority that was severely lacking during the days of Simon Mignolet and Loris Karius. Should Liverpool, as most people expect, win the title, then Alisson will have contributed as greatly as any outfield player. Sachin NakraniManchester City have stumbled at times this season but the momentum is building nicely now. Kevin De Bruyne keeps getting better, making all the players around him look good, even if Sergio Agüero, Gabriel Jesus and Riyad Mahrez hardly need the help. Were Pep Guardiola’s men to embark on a longer hot streak than they did to finish their triumphant 2018-19 campaign, and win their remaining 16 Premier League fixtures, they would finish with 95 points. But considering the form the leaders, Liverpool, are currently in – not to mention their 14-point advantage – this would be nothing more than a minor inconvenience for them. Last season supporters everywhere marvelled at the ludicrous circumstance that a team as good as Liverpool ended up without the title. In May the tables will have turned. Luke McLaughlinThe future of Chelsea’s right flank appeared to be taken care of during the win over Burnley. Reece James and Callum Hudson‑Odoi have risen through the ranks together and their interplay caused plenty of problems for Sean Dyche’s side. James, a right‑back whose crossing ability rivals Trent Alexander-Arnold’s, never stopped marauding forward and Hudson‑Odoi, who is regaining confidence after recovering from a ruptured achilles tendon, capped a fine display with his first Premier League goal. Their understanding was seen in the way they combined for Chelsea’s second, a slick one‑two creating space for James to cross for Tammy Abraham to head home. “Hopefully it’s just the start of the partnership as far as first-team football goes,” Frank Lampard said. “When Callum is being as aggressive as he was today and Reece is behind him, of course it is a big thing.” Jacob SteinbergAs if Mikel Arteta’s in-tray had not been full enough, losing the man he readily calls “probably the most important player” is a blow he could certainly have done without. There were no complaints about Pierre‑Emerick Aubameyang’s red card at Crystal Palace but there is a risk his absence for three games will seriously expose the fact that he has bailed Arsenal out on more occasions than anyone would care to remember since arriving in January 2018. The nature of Arteta’s response, with slim resources to call upon, will be important in maintaining the positive vibes he has created. “Hopefully they have to take a step forward now,” he said of those who might shoulder Aubameyang’s burden. “Someone else has to do it and I want to see their reaction too.” It could be a chance for Gabriel Martinelli, the gifted 18-year-old, to reassert his potential. Nick AmesDanny Ings could have had a hat‑trick in Southampton’s impressive comeback win at Leicester. But the 27-year-old’s winner offered more compelling evidence that he is thriving under the tutelage of Ralph Hasenhüttl. Surely a first England call-up since he won his solitary cap under Roy Hodgson against Lithuania in 2015 is now on the cards. Brendan Rodgers, who signed him for Liverpool from Burnley that summer, certainly thinks so. With Jamie Vardy apparently not keen on making himself available for Euro 2020 and Bournemouth’s Callum Wilson badly out of form, Rodgers said Ings is making a strong case after scoring seven times in the league since the start of December. “There’s no doubt,” said the Leicester manager. “He just needs to keep the consistency and availability and he’ll show he’s one of the best strikers about.” Ed Aarons On Sunday it will be a year since Manchester United last won three consecutive league games. As Harry Maguire identified after this convincing victory against Norwich, Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side are leading a hand-to-mouth existence. “Our problem has been inconsistency,” he said. “We have played two good games and one bad and it has not been good enough. We are not getting carried away. It was a good performance, a clean sheet, a win, but we have to go again on Wednesday and get another good result.” That is an FA Cup replay against Wolves. At least United do have a supremely consistent performer in Marcus Rashford – scorer of two against Norwich on his 200th appearance. “He’s a top player with top quality,” Maguire said. “He has everything.” Sunday’s opponents, though, are Liverpool at Anfield, so United may suffer another setback. Jamie JacksonThe controversy surrounding Robert Snodgrass’s disallowed goal may comfortably overshadow West Ham’s performance at Sheffield United on Friday night but there were serious concerns away from VAR for David Moyes to digest. The Hammers’ pursuit of a new goalkeeper – with Middlesbrough’s Darren Randolph still on their radar – will likely have intensified over the weekend, with Lukasz Fabianski seemingly suffering a recurrence of his hip injury and another error from his replacement. David Martin’s mistake, which led to Oli McBurnie’s winner, was the latest example of the Hammers’ deep-lying issues in goal, something Moyes will need to resolve quickly if he is to steer the Hammers away from the relegation zone. Throw in their lack of potency up front and this was a frustrating night for West Ham long before VAR intervened. Aaron Bower Carlo Ancelotti was quite diplomatic about the fourth-minute penalty Everton were denied against Brighton, considering a goal so early might have lifted the post-derby gloom almost immediately. “I think it was a penalty,” the manager said of the incident when Lewis Dunk clearly pulled Theo Walcott’s shirt as he tried to reach Dominic Calvert‑Lewin’s flick and attempt a shot. “But Theo didn’t go down and that made the referee’s job quite difficult.” True, though even after a VAR check the penalty was refused, despite the tug being visible to most in the ground. If the combination of officials who studied it decided advantage needed to be played because Walcott was still on his feet with a chance of scoring, the result will be managers telling their players to go to ground at every opportunity – especially if their finishing is as weak as Walcott’s. Paul WilsonSomething about Wolves’ draw with Newcastle suggested Nuno Espírito Santo was sending a message to his bosses. With Diogo Jota injured, Pedro Neto was given a chance to shine. He struggled, not the only summer signing to do so at Molineux this season, with Jesús Vallejo and Patrick Cutrone having already departed. But Neto stayed on until the 85th minute as Wolves laboured in their hunt for a winner. One look at the bench showed why: a collection of inexperienced players, with the 21-year-old Benny Ashley-Seal, who made his full debut last week, the only forward. The message was plain: Wolves are short of attacking options. Nuno made clear to the media he wants new forwards in this window, as he has been doing for some time, but on this occasion he may have chosen other means to get his point across.

Rediscovering singing proved the turning point I neededWhen it comes to looking after your mental health, there is a lot of advice about what to start doing and what to stop, but sometimes the remedy is something that has been in the background all along. Which poses the question: what have I stopped doing that once made me, me?About six years ago I started having panic attacks. I began my journey to crack them with traditional tools, including therapy, keeping active, meditation and medication, all of which were a great help. Thankfully, a year later medication was no longer needed and neither was therapy. Problem solved.Frustratingly, about a year after that, when I was seemingly happy and healthy, I started to develop depression and began to have panic attacks once again, and this time they were far more debilitating. I tried what I knew best and went back to my previous toolkit, but I was still struggling and far from feeling well again. Until I got some new advice.My childhood had been filled with creativity. School and, later, university burst at the seams with music, art and dancing, yet for most of my adult life these outlets had been neglected. A therapist I had been seeing told me that mental health issues are incredibly common among the creative minds of the world, the so-called “tortured artist” no surprises there. Yet what we explored was the opposite: what happens when your creativity is suppressed, when you hold back an energy that is ingrained in you? I began to wonder if part of my mental health struggles could be due to the neglect of my creativity: dormant self-expression going nowhere and morphing into anxiety.I love to sing and, when I was younger, I did what a lot of teens did in the 90s: formed a band, learned every Spice Girls routine out there and performed them at school assembly. To rekindle my creative side, I decided to get back into singing and audition for every top established Renaissance chamber choir. Not very Spice Girls. Not so smart.Then I discovered a group called Sound, a pop, funk and soul choir that sings the likes of Beyoncé, Janelle Monáe and Queen. Much better. And in what was a particularly dark patch for me, I found the courage to audition. I was amazed that I managed to put myself through such a high-stakes situation and not have a panic attack. The audition itself was a win for me, never mind how I did.I remember clearly the day I got the email saying they would love me to join them. I was on the top deck of a bus and let out a loud squeal of jubilation. I could not stop smiling to myself for the rest of the journey. It meant a lot.I have now been a member of the choir for three years, rehearsing every Tuesday. I love the community, the challenge, the performances and the fire it lights in my belly. It reminds me of who I was at school. I studied dance because I loved it and sang because I loved it, and my entire education was filled with fond memories because of that, and I was now starting to build that back into my adult life.Although my job is in the creative industry, the day-to-day skills I use are not so I have had to learn the importance of finding time to include creativity in my life. I sing, go to dance classes and make my own Christmas cards. I fear that if these creative outlets stagnate I may relapse and if keeping healthy means doing things I love all the time, I am certainly not going to complain.My anxiety attacks came out of nowhere and, to this day, I am still clueless as to what sets them off. Now, though, I am feeling a lot better. When I am anxious, distraction is key and singing does exactly that. It sends me into autopilot, a state in which my body works without instruction, but with pure passion and joy – a meditative state.Don’t get me wrong, there are weeks when the last thing I want to do after work is go to choir practice and I long to go home to bed. But I go because I know I am guaranteed to come out feeling great. I will leave having loved every second, learned something new and progressed my vocal skills. More importantly, I will have exercised my creativity and held my anxiety at bay. What more could I ask for?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/328ff7132f047ace5ba61f78da2b550b24d5f4da/0_0_2378_2233/master/2378.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=529f854acf6bb57fe02aa6328e93a6d4 1400w","title":"standing room only and a hungry stork sundays best photos","story":"’s picture editors select photo highlights from around the world, including a protest race in Bangkok and a volcanic eruption in the Philippines"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f35e88b2d745a79d9267ca820d087e791c46026b/0_35_1760_1056/master/1760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2c7bcfa4d0c38379dd4a0743d6679bf","title":"brexit irish border uk northern ireland","story":"Northern Ireland customs plans could take five years to implement, IfG saysThe Irish border could yet snag Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal, with experts saying it will be impossible to deliver the computer systems for the special arrangements for Northern Ireland by the end of this year. Failure to implement the new systems will risk legal action by the European commission against Britain, the Institute for Government says.Johnson’s government remains adamant that there will be no checks or new reporting systems on trade crossing the Irish sea, despite Ireland and the EU insisting that those would have to be in place to protect the Irish border.The prime minister’s intention to establish a trade deal with the EU by the end of December 2020 was also dealt a blow by Simon Coveney, Ireland’s deputy prime minister, at the weekend as he indicated the bloc would be in no rush to work to Johnson’s timetable.In a blunt assessment of the likelihood of satisfying Johnson’s “ambitious” vision, he said the fact that Britain had put the timescale for a trade deal into law did not mean the other 27 European countries would fall in line. “In my view, it’s probably going to take longer than a year,” he said.The IfG’s report says HMRC has previously stated similar systems to the proposed customs arrangements for Northern Ireland would take five years to develop and implement.Part of the problem is that until the new trade deal between the UK and the EU is struck, the details of the Northern Ireland arrangements cannot be finalised.The complicated system for Northern Ireland involves the region effectively staying in the single market but in the UK customs zone. This potentially means tariff charges and rebates, paperwork and physical checks on certain fresh foods and live animals going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.In the new report, “Getting Brexit done: what happens now?”, the IfG says Brexit will be far from done on 31 January when the UK formally leaves the EU with the expected ratification of the withdrawal agreement ending the article 50 process.“The UK will formally leave the EU at the end of January, and in that sense Brexit will be done, but many of the biggest Brexit jobs will be far from over,” it says. “It will continue to dominate government for years to come. The prime minister may hope to end Brexit’s dominance in the public debate after 31 January, but in Whitehall it will continue to be the biggest and most challenging task faced by a government in decades.”Under the deal sealed by Johnson with the EU last October, animals and fresh food going from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will be subject to some physical checks, with a tariff and tariff rebate system operating for the first time. These are there to protect any substandard goods seeping into the EU’s single market through smuggling over the Irish border into the Republic of Ireland.While all sides recognise the complexities of the new system, little public attention has been paid to the fact that new computer systems cannot be designed by either HMRC, ferry companies, or manufacturers or suppliers like Tesco until the trade deal with the EU is done.The report says: “With the details of how the border will operate still unclear – and likely to be so for some months – and no preparatory work having happened for checks between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the 11-month timeline is almost certainly undeliverable.”It notes that Sir Jon Thompson, a former chief executive of HMRC, said that a similar customs systems involving rebates could take up to five years to develop and implement.Coveney issued his warning on BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show, saying the deal to be struck between the UK and EU over their future relationship was vast, encompassing security, data, aviation and trade.He said: “When people talk about the future relationship in the UK in particular, they seem to only talk about a future trade agreement. Actually, there’s much more to this than that … I know that Johnson has set a very ambitious timetable to get this done – he’s even put it into British law – but just because a British parliament decides that British law says something, doesn’t mean that that law applies to the other 27 countries of the European Union.“And so the European Union will approach this on the basis of getting the best deal possible, a fair and balanced deal, to ensure that the UK and the EU can interact as friends in the future. But the EU will not be rushed on this just because Britain passes a law.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d675423d5d1f73c0bac3bb0e13517dc623afae2/516_307_1464_878/master/1464.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe70798d9a7fa4bd62c676d9c1c98f56","title":"happy fleet could electric vehicles enhance the joy of driving","story":"EVs mean cleaner cities, but could they improve the experience for drivers too? One ground-breaking partnership piloted by Audi and Addison Lee Group uncovered some surprising benefits to going electricFor companies that rely on fleet vehicles, change is inevitable. A raft of green policies have introduced zero-emissions targets, along with financial incentives encouraging businesses to adopt cleaner cars and vans, such as no vehicle tax for electric company cars in 202021.However, as well as helping the planet and improving a company’s bottom line, the “greening” of vehicle fleets by going fully electric could bring additional benefits. A recent widely reported study found that jumping behind the wheel of an electric car – rather than a traditional petrol or diesel – could also make drivers happier, calmer and less stressed too.Those findings are backed up by Audi’s own research, which found that electric vehicle drivers typically get more pleasure from the experience. According to a combination of 1,350 surveys and 2,000 minutes of interviews, the benefits include a reduction in vibration and engine noise, which can leave drivers feeling less drained after spending time in traffic. EV drivers also reported being able to perform difficult manoeuvres much more easily, and a greater sense of control. Others felt more at one with the vehicle as a result of all the technology. As one respondent put it: “It’s part of me when I drive. It has so much tech involved in it.”That Audi research is now being put to the test as part of a forward-thinking pilot partnership with the Addison Lee Group’s business class car service, Tristar.Addison Lee Group has added five new luxury e-tron SUVs, Audi’s first fully electric cars, with a range of up to 237 miles, to its premium London lineup. The aim is to offer chauffeurs, customers, and both businesses a unique opportunity to understand the real-world performance, opportunities and challenges of going fully electric to achieve a zero-emissions future.The Addison Lee Group chauffeurs underwent simple training with Audi’s electric vehicle specialists before going out to work as usual, driving premium customers around the capital.The ongoing trial enables Addison Lee Group and Audi to see how the cars perform in a real-world, business-critical situation – where running out of battery is not an option. That includes collecting hard data on mileage and usage from the car’s telemetrics, along with the driver’s subjective feedback on the challenges of adopting electric in real-world conditions, including things such as the availability of charging.The proof, though, is in the driving. So what did Addison Lee Group’s trialists make of the experience behind the wheel?“From the beginning I said that I was going to drive it the same way I would a diesel car and that’s what I’ve done,” says Alan Meere, a platinum chauffeur for Tristar. “I feel more relaxed when I get home because I haven’t spent the day fighting the steering wheel. There’s also no droning constantly in your ear like you can get with diesel cars, and you notice that especially after a motorway run. You still get the noise of the tyres but even that’s quieter.”According to Meere, who lives in Sittingbourne, Kent and has been driving for the Addison Lee Group for nine years, any potential anxiety about range soon subsided.“When I came into the pilot, my main reservations were things like whether there would be enough chargers,” he says. “Also, would living so far from London make a difference? But once you realise how good the car is, and you start to understand how to fit charging into your daily routine, that all goes away. Many service stations now have these chargers.”“Being able to plug it in and leave it overnight is hugely convenient,” says Meere. “But if I’m not home long enough for work reasons, then there are also options close by where I can charge it quickly, ready for the next day.”According to figures from Zap Map, a listing app that helps you find your nearest charge points, there are more than 10,000 charging locations in the UK. Finding nearby charge isn’t dissimilar to seeking out your closest petrol station – you learn the locations of the points you use most often.“I’ve developed a map in my head of where I can charge,” says Meere. “If I need a speedy charge, there are three places I use regularly – one at Heathrow and two near where I live. On the 150Kw points I can get close to full in 40 minutes,” he adds.This partnership has been so successful that it’s been extended beyond the initial six months. “I believe our collaboration with Addison Lee Group has been invaluable as a means of further demystifying the concept of the fully electric Audi,” says Andrew Doyle, director of Audi UK.“Although the e-tron is revolutionary as far as our brand is concerned, this project has helped to emphasise its uncomplicated, user-friendly normality to everyone who travels in one. On the one hand, it has proved that it requires minimal compromise as a daily-use proposition by meeting the understandably rigorous demands of Addison Lee Group’s professional drivers in an undeniably challenging working environment. On the other, it has driven home the fact that in terms of comfort, configuration and general usability, the car is a home-from-home for anyone familiar with a contemporary Audi.”Paul McCabe, corporate director at Addison Lee Group, says the pilot has helped to inform the group’s decisions about the fleet choices it will make as it works towards its target of having a fleet capable of zero emissions by 2022. “By generating data-driven insights, the e-tron pilot has allowed us to evaluate the real-world performance and requirements of electric vehicles in our fleet of the future,” he says.Although big change is coming, much will stay the same, and that’s a comfort for those who will experience the revolution first hand.“It’s still a car and you still just drive it the same way,” says Meere, “but it’s just more pleasant to drive. If I had the choice, I’d stay with the electric vehicle now.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/005664f5d4d6232bcf5bfde2ccabc45e44aa0eac/149_0_4658_2796/master/4658.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4109bc03a6e7125984613cf7cb3a11f7","title":"understated beauty great brands have one big idea that chimes with people","story":"For a brand such as Audi, form really does follow function – which translates into designs that instill a sense of reliability, efficiency and trustIt was the audacious simplicity of it. At last year’s Milan Design Week, a giant ring was suspended inside the courtyard of the city’s Seminario Arcivescovile, a seminary that was built in 1564.Ma Yansong, the founder of MAD Architects, which developed the installation with Audi, explained the thinking behind it: “The illuminated ring in the square boundary of the historical courtyard stands for mankind’s strive for perfection.”The installation, called “Fifth Ring”, was arguably a perfect metaphor for a design aesthetic that has long been associated with the German carmaker. The air of quiet confidence. The understated beauty. Its sheer efficiency.But the aesthetic is also a business ethos rendered into physical form.“Audi are an interesting brand in the way they tapped very deliberately into the whole German design aesthetic of engineering efficiency, rationality and modernity,” says Jeremy Myerson, chair of design at the Helen Hamlyn Centre for Design at the Royal College of Art and founding editor of Design Week. “Those values go back to the Bauhaus roots of good form, everything precisely as it needs to be – and there is still commercial equity in that, as we’ve seen in brands like Apple. The idea is that in a complex world you need simplicity, and that continues to hold its own.”Audi has made a virtue of those principles in its adherence to functionality and to the concept of progress through technology (better known as vorsprung durch technik). It’s a subtle message with a powerful appeal. The beauty of its cars flow from fundamental engineering values that feed into quality and consistency.“Most great brands have one big emotional idea, very simple, very recognisable and it chimes with people,” says Myerson, “You buy an Audi because you’re identifying emotionally in a high quality, technical machine. It instils ideas of reliability and efficiency – trust essentially. And that’s what the best brands are about.”Simplicity should never be mistaken for predictability or dullness. Audi has always been ready to push the envelope, whether it came to the aerodynamics of its iconic 1980s Quattro or the sporty elegance of the TT.“Audi has always been able to be creative within its own defined rules,” says Howard Guy, co-managing director of automotive and aviation consultancy, Design Q. “They were the first manufacturer to start using materials and finishes that play off each other very imaginatively. For instance, the TT dash had a superb grain, a texture and softness which didn’t make it feel like it was a great big injection-moulded piece of plastic like most things at the time. There were little details, a bit of gloss, a bit of brushed aluminium, the way the materials were brought together that was very refreshing and everyone began to copy it. It’s about perception, the way of making something mass market look expensive. It’s clever because it’s about playing with surfaces and colours – things that don’t cost much. It’s the same approach that makes for a great handbag.”Audi’s lesson is one of boldness and confidence in its ability to take materials and technology and synthesise them into something that symbolises progress in an elegantly understated way, whether it be the Audi A8 aluminium Space Frame of the early 1990s or the 1995 TT coupe that has proved so enduring.“The very first TT had the baseball interior with the heavy leather seats with the huge stitching. Nobody had done that before or been bold enough,” says Guy. “They were very sure of their ground. When it came to those great cars, they did it with courage and that’s a disappearing value in the car industry today, there’s so much to lose, everyone plays safe.”The danger of homogeneity must always be set against destroying core values and Audi’s heritage has meant a consistency of approach. It is a premium brand and everything stays as in tune to that as its legendarily reliable engines.Embracing new technology in the shape of electrical motors and AI brings new challenges, but you expect that core principle of form following function will always provide a solution that connects with its audience. The Audi Q4 e-tron concept features recycled plastic fabric and sustainable paint developed to reflect sunlight so the car requires less air-conditioning.Being ahead of the curve while remaining faithful to its ideals is how Audi has managed to match its engineering prowess with an equally impressive design aesthetic. In short, it’s the Audi way of doing business – and it’s also why the phrase vorsprung durch technik has become synonymous with the brand."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53d7ace6a17bcddd7663058f68184213523a8436/15_1_712_427/master/712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bdd3ac2ae266769e6fe0ca3a27d4ddfb","title":"can you solve it the poco poco puzzle","story":"How to count a little in SpanishHow many “fews” do you need until you have “a lot”?

I call a client, Ethan*, at around 9am. He’s 15 and out of school because his friends and his postcode make him a target for a local gang. He studies at home but has fallen behind.Ethan and I revise a letter I’ve drafted to his local council requesting a move to another borough. His council doubts the veracity of his story and has refused previous requests.At 9.45am I arrive at a housing office to support a homeless client. Once I’m done with security I head upstairs to find Paige, 19, sitting with black bags containing all her possessions. As a care leaver, Paige should have been supported into independence and a secure home. However, she was asked to leave her accommodation when she was 17 and so began her life on and off the streets.We are seen at 3pm by a housing officer who directs our attention to a pictogram on the wall depicting the number of properties sought against the fraction provided. She says we’re her eighth case today. After 40 minutes of enquiries and attempts to refer Paige’s case to another borough, she agrees to provide emergency accommodation.I support Callum, 18 and a care leaver, at a meeting to discuss his rent arrears with a representative from his landlord and his personal adviser (PA), a person employed by the local authority to support its care leavers. His PA refuses to acknowledge that by referring Callum’s case to the housing department when he presented as homeless at 16, thereby making him liable for rent, the local authority set him up to fail. As a result he has begun adulthood already drowning in debt. Thankfully the representative for the landlord agrees – much to the frustration of Callum’s PA, who reluctantly agrees to ask for support from the local authority. In the morning I support Chloe, 19, at a meeting with children’s services. She is balancing her education with fighting to keep her children, and is asking for a contact arrangement that’s compatible with her college timetable. Her tenacity and grit is inspiring. Despite the many concerns raised about her learning disabilities, she continues to aim high, engage with services and surpass others’ expectations.I meet Jacob, who is 16. During our brief discussion outside the housing office, he tells me he spent Monday and Tuesday evening riding the night bus, and last night on a friend’s sofa. I have found that young people aged 16 and up have a particularly difficult time accessing children’s services support.I arrive at my first appointment to support Luke, 17 and a looked-after child, at a meeting with professionals supporting him. His “non-engagement” is the prevailing theme.This description, used far too often as a reason for withdrawing support, reflects the chronic lack of accountability across services. Luke had struggled for nearly six months to get out from his hostile home life. Young people in this kind of situation are doubly disadvantaged: once by failing services and by their own response to those failures. Luke’s education suffered, his mental health plummeted and he started smoking marijuana. Because of the long delays, this will be Luke’s only meeting. He will be 18 next week and no longer eligible for this support.On my way back to the office I receive a call from Ethan, informing me that his local authority has agreed to send him to a school in a borough where he is safe. Great news.Advocacy often leaves me feeling dispirited. Fighting for resources that don’t exist in the quantity needed is exhausting. It can often feel hopeless, as though I’m transporting young people from one crisis into another within a system that is seemingly imploding.But I’ve also seen what happens when the work continues in spite of all these difficulties. For those who give support and for those who receive it, I’ve seen the smallest respite from chaotic situations reveal aspects of creativity, aspiration and aptitude that surprise even the young people themselves. It is a privilege to say farewell to someone at the end of a chaotic experience, after supporting them throughout – and it is confirmation that even the worst situations can and do change.*All clients’ names have been changed.If you would like to contribute to our My working week series about your job in public services, get in touch by emailing sarah.johnson@the"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffb9affaf016d743f1fc25ec777c555998bc4025/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27d63497bcff1275be9f18f277e2ffe9","title":"rugby union talking points weekends champions cup","story":"Danny Cipriani’s injury has hurt Gloucester with a crunch match to come while Saracens and Racing 92 meet in a game to savourA sure sign of a good team is one that keeps winning convincingly even when not entirely striking its best form. Leinster currently fit that description, seeing off Lyon by a 28-point margin in the absence of Johnny Sexton, among others. This was their 15th win in 15 competitive fixtures this season – 10 of them in the Pro 14 – and they have a squad whose depth is steadily increasing. In Max Deegan they have another fine prospect at No 8 where Caelan Doris has already forced himself into the Six Nations reckoning and they will be a daunting prospect for any opponent heading to Dublin in the quarter-finals. All that is now required to rubber-stamp a quarter-final in Dublin is a solid result in Treviso, although the Italian side are becoming increasingly hard to beat at home. They might also have beaten Northampton at Franklin’s Gardens but for untimely injuries to key men and the force of nature that is the massive Taqele Naiyaravoro.There is no substitute for the hard yards. It seems a team must simply do their time in this competition before they start to get the hang of it. Exeter represent as poignant an illustration of this truth as any. This is their seventh attempt and the first time they have qualified for the quarter-finals in a manner that might be described as “under control”. They did qualify as group winners in 2016 with a mere three victories, tied on 16 with two others in one of the most outlandish pools ever known. This time they will progress to a home quarter-final if they beat La Rochelle at Sandy Park on Saturday. Glasgow are not quite out of it but need to win at Sale and hope other results go their way.There has been something processional about this season’s competition, with a shortfall in the kind of ferocious, scrambling drama we have come to expect from it. That Clermont Auvergne are the stragglers among the pool leaders with a round to go and as many as 20 match points is indicative. Bar Exeter, the English have not really turned up (see the meek showing by the pair in this pool), paving the way for any well-stocked team who fancy it to have their way. Clermont will hope Harlequins maintain the ambivalent English approach for Saturday’s encounter at the Stoop. Ulster ought to win at home to Bath, so are ready to step in should Quins rouse themselves, but a best-runners-up spot is their likeliest reward.Racing 92’s bonus-point victory over Munster delivered the pool title and left the Irish province all but eliminated. Racing trailed for long periods but the strength of their bench gave them the means to pull away with three tries in the final 10 minutes. Racing may require something from their final match at Saracens on a day when the holders need to win to have a chance of going through as one of the best runners-up, vying with Gloucester and Northampton, who also have 14 points but both finish their campaigns in France. Glasgow are also in the mix on 12 points but Munster’s failure to leave Paris with a bonus point means they need Saracens to secure no more than one on Sunday, take five off the Ospreys and have other results go their way. If Sarries go through, they could find themselves in Exeter in the last eight.If Gloucester fail to progress in Europe this season they will not have to look far for the reasons. They sent a weakened side to Montpellier and lost 30-27 and also went down by three points to Connacht in Galway, leaving themselves the tricky task of winning in Toulouse this Sunday. It does not help that their key playmaker Danny Cipriani limped off on Saturday with a sore-looking lower leg injury, nor that Toulouse are one of only two teams to have won all their five pool games thus far. The good news is that, if selected, Jake Polledri will make sizeable dents in any defence and their 18-year-old wing Louis Rees-Zammit looks a threat in any company. So good has the fleet-footed newcomer been in recent weeks that it will a surprise if Wales do not include him in their Six Nations squad to be named on Wednesday, if only to sidestep any possibility of England nipping in and trying to poach the Penarth-born flyer themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0147f16fe9feef1ae36b879b66796de0c28d13a7/239_0_3532_2121/master/3532.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6249c3376de9b3726943eae4fa5701a2","title":"a bullet dodged can winter love island survive its controversies","story":"The reality show is riddled with issues – and adding a new series reeks of desperation. Is this the beginning of the end for the ITV2 behemoth? Love Island has occupied a weird spot in the heart of British culture for a few years now, at once able to be adored by the public at large and intellectualised to death by broadsheet newspapers. But you have to admit that, if the wheels were ever going to come off, they’ll come off now.The controversy regarding the suicides of two former contestants, and the questions asked of ITV about the level of aftercare afforded to them, did Love Island no favours. And the sudden change in personnel, with Laura Whitmore being drafted in at the last minute after previous host Caroline Flack (who denies all claims) was accused of bludgeoning her boyfriend’s head with a table lamp in his sleep, couldn’t have come at a worse time. And now there is a winter Love Island series, the first episode of which debuted last night.This might be the biggest danger of all. The show has moved past the other issues especially Flack, who in reality didn’t actually contribute very much. But adding a second annual series reeks of desperation. Oversaturation has already killed everything from Big Brother to X Factor, and at this rate Love Island might be next. It now needs to source twice as many contestants a year without demonstrating a drop in quality. Surely there aren’t enough identical preening berks in the UK to sustain that sort of output.But good news! Apparently there are! The opening episode was textbook Love Island. The boys were all woy-oy sixpacks and cartoon teeth. The girls all uniformly looked as if they required the services of an osteopath from struggling under the weight of their own eyebrows. One contestant claims she was the inspiration for that song Lewis Capaldi wrote about his horrible girlfriend. Another’s chat-up line was “If my dad dies, I become a lord.” One boy observed the full, beautiful, dramatic sweep of humanity with all its gorgeous and heartbreaking nuances before declaring that his greatest wish in life was to have a girlfriend with nice eyebrows. Meanwhile, the girls quickly agreed that they really wanted to find a boy with a personality. That’s it. That’s as detailed as the discussion got.Nor has the new winter setting altered the format. Part of me was hoping that a show called Winter Love Island would really lean into the title, and consist of nothing but introverts in big coats avoiding eye contact over cups of tea during a slating blizzard in Bognor. But no. Like always, it was just loads of slow motion footage of women in bikinis Here Come The Girlsing their way across some decking for what felt like hours at a time. God, there is so much slow motion on Love Island. If ITV would play the whole thing at normal speed, the entire series would be over by Wednesday.Obviously it’s pointless to truly judge a reality show by its first episode, because all the really entertaining fights and handjobs and ugly personality schisms won’t occur for another week or so. But already the show is doing a good job at pointing us towards potential baddies. Key among them are Connor – a man who genuinely bought his teeth on Google – who has already shown himself to be needy and vindictive in equal measure and Ollie, who is posh.And then there are The Twins, Eve and Jessica, who sent the status quo haywire in the dying moments of last night’s episode by tottering in like a pair of Paris Hilton androids sent loopy by a rogue Lambrini spill. By being twins with boobs, they currently represent the biggest threat to every single rock solid 45-minute-old relationship inside the villa.So far, we can rack up this series as a bullet dodged. For better or worse, Winter Love Island is exactly the same as Summer Love Island. If you didn’t like the original, there is nothing to suggest that you’ll suddenly come around to it now. But if you’re a fan, knock yourselves out. Now you get to spend two seasons a year feeling bad about your physical appearance instead of just one.

But doing a phone interview with Brian Cox – the acclaimed actor, that is, not the pop-star-turned-particle-physicist with the same name – is such a hoot that if we met in person I would have probably dissolved into a puddle of hysteria.“No, no, not now, I’m having an important conversation!” he barks when someone has the temerity to try to enter his hotel room 45 minutes into our chat. “So where was I? Ah yes …” And he launches back into the anecdote about the time Princess Margaret felt him up. The man has so much charisma – and so many anecdotes – to burn, I can practically feel my phone melting against my face.Cox has a place in north London, as well as a family home in New York, where he lives with his wife, Nicole Ansari, and their two sons. But we are talking by phone because he is still in Los Angeles, celebrating his triumph at the Golden Globes last weekend. He was named best actor in a TV series for his role on HBO’s Succession as Logan Roy, the oligarch who occasionally encourages but largely torments his four grasping, feuding children. The show (which was created by Peep Show’s Jesse Armstrong and will shoot its third season this year) is brilliant on wealth, media tycoons and corrupt dynastic families and feels breathtakingly of the moment. But the smart writing and acting make it timeless. Cox’s performance as the inscrutable then suddenly, terrifyingly, raging centre of the family already feels definitive.Yet when his name was announced last Sunday, he was shocked. “Well, you never know with these things, do you? I thought I was maybe in with a chance, if only from a longevity point of view,” he says with a low rumble of a laugh. At 73, he will celebrate 60 years in the business next year. “I’m just surprised I’m still standing, I really am,” he says.Afterwards, he celebrated his win – and Succession’s win, which was named best TV drama – by “taking lots of selfies”. Elton John paid his respects: “He was very praising of my Churchill, which was kind,” says Cox, who played the PM in the eponymous 2017 film. Leonardo DiCaprio also stopped by to tell him: “I’ve always wanted to work with you.” “Well, you’ve taken long enough about it,” Cox growled back. Has Cox always wanted to work with DiCaprio? “Mmmm, I don’t think in those terms,” he says affably.Mainly he celebrated with the cast, even giving Kieran Culkin, who plays Cox’s onscreen son, a big kiss on the mouth as he went up to get his award. “I’m close to all my boys. We’re very family-like, which is ironic as we play such a dysfunctional family,” he says.I ask if that closeness makes it harder for him to torture them on the show, such as in the infamous “boar on the floor” segment, when Logan makes family members scrabble for sausages.“No, I love being nasty to my children!” he cackles.Given that Cox is one of Britain’s most prolific actors, celebrated as much for his theatre work (he won an Olivier in 1988 for Titus Andronicus) as he is for his TV roles (Nuremberg, Deadwood, Bob Servant Independent) and film successes (Manhunter, Braveheart, Super Troupers, The Bourne Identity), it would be ludicrous to describe this as his moment. Even in his relatively small roles – as the disapproving headmaster in Rushmore, say, or the terrifying writing guru in Adaptation – Cox has always dominated the screen. But Logan Roy has caught the public’s imagination in a way that feels new to him.Cox is a Labour supporter who has campaigned for Scottish independence. So he wasn’t wildly impressed with the results of last month’s election. “Ach! The Brits are so feudal. They don’t listen to a civil servant like Jeremy Corbyn, but they will listen to a windbag Tory like Johnson. And my country has suffered for it,” he says.I have heard that Cox is a fan of cannabis so I ask if that helps him cope with the political situation in the US and UK. There is a long pause and I worry I’ve overstepped a line.“It’s absolutely great and I recommend it to everyone – get stoned!” he says with deep feeling. “It does make the politics easier to bear. It’s a way of dealing with idiocy.”Has he always been a stoner? “I didn’t start until I was 50,” he says. “I was very against it, actually. You know, I got married at 21 to an upper-middle-class English girl – well, with Scots parentage, but you know English Scots are the most English! Hahaha! We had two children, one went to St Paul’s, one went to Cheltenham Ladies College. It was all done proper. It wasn’t who I was, but happy wife, happy life. Then when I was 50, I realised I missed out on what was going on with young people because I was so square, and I was working so hard, I needed something to relax. So I discovered the wonderful world of cannabis.”There have been inevitable comparisons between Logan Roy and Rupert Murdoch, despite Cox’s denials (“Rupert Murdoch has fuck all to do with it, and you can quote me on that,” he barked at the Golden Globes). But it must be strange for him, having played a media tycoon now for two seasons, to see the ongoing dominance of Fox News in the US, or to watch Michael Bloomberg’s bid for the presidency.“Yeah, it’s interesting. All these guys, whether they’re liberal or the opposite, they see themselves as leaders. And they all have their own problems – clearly, because we’re suffering because of their problems! We’ve suffered under the hands of the Murdoch press and Conrad Black and now Donald Trump.”And yet despite the show depicting how extreme wealth corrupts extremely, it has accrued fans among that demographic. Cox was recently in a cafe in Primrose Hill, north London, when he was approached by a man who told him that he and his wife liked Succession, “but she found it a little hard to watch sometimes”.“Who’s your wife?” asked Cox. “Elisabeth Murdoch,” he replied. “Can you go a bit easier on her next season?”So I’m guessing he’s not a fan of The Crown, I say. There’s another pause. “I love it!” he says, and makes a loud guilty laugh. “I resisted it for ever and a day and then I started to watch it and it was like heroin. I was completely hooked – and that’s how they get you.”Jesse Armstrong wove some of Cox’s biography into Logan’s, making the character a native of Dundee and even shooting some scenes in Cox’s hometown. Like Logan, Cox has a daughter and three sons from two marriages and, also like his alter ego, his childhood was unimaginably different from the one he was able to give his kids.Cox was born and raised in Dundee, the youngest of five children of a butcher and a spinner. The family was always poor but when Cox was eight their situation worsened immeasurably after his father died from cancer. Soon after, his mother had a severe nervous breakdown and was given electric shock treatment. From the age of 10, Cox was largely raised by his sisters and on some nights, there was so little food in the house he would go to the local chippie and beg for battered scraps.“People who don’t know poverty haven’t lived, quite frankly. You know everything is conditional,” he says. To this day, he has a bigger wardrobe than his wife because he is a terrible hoarder – after growing up with nothing, he can’t bear to give anything away.Cox stumbled through school, leaving at 15 with no qualifications. He worked as a stage manager (“Worst stage manager ever – I always left the iron on”) before going to Lamda to study acting.I ask what he thinks about the arguments over whether British acting is too dominated by posh people and he jumps in before I finish.“You can’t blame Damian Lewis or Eddie Redmayne or whatsisname, er, Benedict Cumberpast, er, Cumberpat, no, Cumberbatch – that’s it,” he says. “You know, talent is talent and one has to be careful about not being mean. But it says something about our creative work that we haven’t got an even playing field. Egalitarian thinking is completely lacking in the UK,” he says.This lack of egalitarianism sparks another thought. There is a brief cheeky “Shall I tell this or not? Yes, I shall” hesitation.“You know, when I was a young actor I was touched up by Princess Margaret,” he says.Brian, I am going to need more details on this.“I was at the Royal Court. I was doing a play with Alan Bates and it was my 23rd birthday and I’d been given a red shirt from Lindsay Anderson. I’d just washed my hair so I was sort of glistening, heh heh heh, and I walked in and was introduced to her. She put her fingers on my shirt, and said: ‘This is a lovely shirt.’ And she started to run her fingers down the inside of my shirt. And I went: Uh oh! What do you do when you’re being touched up by a royal?”What do you do?“It was so funny. James Bolam, he could see what was going on and started going ‘Ooooh’ out of the side of his mouth, which somehow said princess didn’t take in at all. She just kept saying: ‘You were so wonderfully hooded on stage. I wanted to know more about you …’ She was an extraordinay creature. I excused myself and said: ‘Thank you, ma’am,’ and it came to a natural end.”What an amazing man Cox is, working his way up from begging for scraps in Dundee to the absolute top of the Hollywood tree ( “I know, I must write my memoir”). Even his Brooklyn apartment is so smart that the New York Times once did a whole article about it. This included the memorable detail that he and his wife have separate bedrooms and a studio that they “tryst in”. Is this true? He has a shag room?“Yeah! We do. The problem is in New York City it’s bloody hard to find the space. But it’s basically her room and I’m allowed to visit occasionally, heh heh heh,” he cackles in a manner that is, undeniably, deliciously, Logan Roy-ish.Succession will return to Sky and NOW TV in 2020 and is available on Sky Store now"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a9e08bca4aeb4c27ec1b04b82c241563f462840/0_54_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da7a8f9fd18523cfc963490ffbfce734","title":"libya talks moscow diplomatic coup vladimir putin","story":"Summit will bring together two sides in civil war and confirms Russia’s increasing influenceVladimir Putin has pulled off a significant diplomatic coup by arranging a mini-summit in Moscow between the two sides in Libya’s long-running civil war.It is not clear whether Field Marshal Khalifa Haftar, the leader of the Libyan National Army forces in the east, and Fayez al-Sarraj, the leader of the UN-recognised government in Tripoli, will meet, but the presence of the two sides in the Russian capital is a confirmation of Russia’s increasingly important role in Libya.Divided European countries have failed to bring about an end to an increasingly bloody nine-month assault on Tripoli by Haftar.The two leaders and their delegations are due to sign a truce deal, consolidating an agreement the two men separately made for a ceasefire over the weekend.The ceasefire, demanded jointly by Moscow and Turkey last week, came into force on Sunday, but was sporadically broken.Sarraj had previously demanded that Haftar’s troops withdraw to their positions before the start of their April offensive. A ceasefire is seen as a necessary precursor to wider talks. Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, will also be present at the Moscow meeting.If the two Libyan antagonists met face to face it would not be for the first time, but it would be the first direct meeting since Haftar launched his attack on Tripoli, which has been denounced by Sarraj as a war crime.The two men have previously met face to face in Abu Dhabi and in Paris to sign various peace agreements that have then fallen apart.Only last week Sarraj refused to go ahead with a planned meeting in Rome with the Italian prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, after he learned that Conte was also meeting Haftar. Sarraj finally went ahead with the Rome meeting on Saturday, but without Haftar.Russia has increased its leverage in Libya by allowing a small number of Russian mercenaries tied to the private Wagner Group to operate near Tripoli on behalf of Haftar. Putin insists if any Russian troops are operating they do not have his sanction.The diplomatic jockeying between Europe, Turkey and Russia over Libya is significant since the country credited with finally bringing peace to Libya is likely to benefit in terms of diplomatic prestige and even future contracts.Although Libya and Syria are very different cases, there are some parallels with the way an uneasy alliance of Turkey, Russia and Iran grabbed hold of the political negotiations in Syria, wresting the initiative from the US, Europe and the UN.It is not yet clear if Putin is trying to push Europe out of the peacemaking process, or is willing to work in conjunction with European nations.Putin met the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, at the weekend in Russia. Berlin has been due to hold a peace conference with the main interested parties and the array of external actors, but no date has yet been set for the frequently postponed event.Italy, once seen as the pre-eminent decision-maker in Libya, has been trying to recover lost ground by proposing a trilateral peace process with Russia and Turkey. Conte has come under ferocious domestic criticism for mishandling the crisis, and for being seen as irrelevant. He is due to meet the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, on Monday.Separately the new European commission has been seeking to take a more active role.The EU council president, Charles Michel, on Sunday went to Cairo to talk to the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, one of the strongest backers of Haftar. The new commission, anxious that the US is pulling back in the Middle East, is desperate not to leave a western void filled by Turkey and Russia.Turkey appears to have bought itself some leverage in the future of Libya talks by announcing it is prepared to send troops there to help up prop up Sarraj’s Government of National Accord (GNA).Military figures in the GNA claim as many as 500 Russian mercenaries have been operating in southern Tripoli, and there were signs that they were being pulled back from the frontlines at the weekend.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, spoke to Putin on Monday to tell him he supported a ceasefire that was “credible, durable and verifiable”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d675eca8e903770174fb17815e656821a1a16b1/0_101_3989_2393/master/3989.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df90f60e272f0ccbe64272b107559299","title":"philippines lava gushes from taal volcano as alert level raised","story":"Scientists warn ‘hazardous eruption’ imminent as offices, schools and airports closedLava has gushed out of a volcano in the Philippines after a sudden eruption of ash and steam that forced villagers to flee and shut down the country’s main airport, offices and schools.Clouds of ash were blown more than 62 miles (100km) north of the Taal volcano, reaching the bustling capital, Manila, and forcing the the main international airport to close and cancel more than 500 flights.There have been no reports of casualties or major damage from the eruption that began on Sunday.Police said more than 13,000 villagers had been moved to evacuation centres in the hard-hit province of Batangas and nearby Cavite, but officials expect the number to swell with hundreds of thousands more being brought to safety.The evacuation numbers are likely to be higher as local authorities help displaced people before notifying the national agency that is collating the figures. Some residents could not move out of ash-blanketed villages because of a lack of transport and poor visibility, while others are refusing to leave their homes and farms.“We have a problem, our people are panicking due to the volcano because they want to save their livelihood, their pigs and herds of cows,” Wilson Maralit, the mayor of Balete town, told DZMM radio. “Were trying to stop them from returning and warning that the volcano can explode again any time and hit them.”Maralit, whose town lies along the shoreline of Taal Lake, which surrounds the erupting volcano, appealed for troops and additional police to be deployed to stop residents from sneaking back into high-risk areas.Several planes stranded at the Manila airport might be allowed to take off on Monday once they were cleaned of ash and authorities were sure an easterly shift in ash-laden wind away from the capital would not revert, the airport general manager, Ed Monreal, told a news conference. The airport could not accommodate incoming flights until stranded aircraft had flown out and freed up parking bays, he said.The aircraft of the president, Rodrigo Duterte, was able to land on Monday after his flight, from his southern Davao city hometown, was delayed on Sunday by the volcanic eruption, his spokesman said.Taal had been restive for months until it suddenly rumbled back to life on Sunday, blasting steam, ash and pebbles up to nine miles into the sky, according to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. Lava spurting from the volcano’s vents on Monday was falling into the lake surrounding the crater.The government volcano-monitoring agency raised the danger level around Taal three notches to level 4, indicating an imminent hazardous eruption. Level 5, the highest, means a hazardous eruption is under way and could affect a larger area with high-risk zones that would need to be cleared of people, said Renato Solidum, who heads the institute. Antonio Bornas, the agency’s chief volcanologist, said Taal spurted fountains of lava early on Monday while its ash and steam ejections slightly eased. “It’s hard to tell when the eruption would stop,” she said, citing the volcanos similar restiveness in the 1970s that lasted for about four months.With the ashfall easing on Monday, some residents began to shovel away ash that covered everything from homes to cars and roads in Tagaytay, a popular upland resort city on a ridge that overlooks the small but picturesque volcano. Many of the city’s restaurants and coffee shops, however, were closed.The volcanology institute reminded the public that the small island where the volcano lay was a permanent danger zone, although fishing villages had existed there for years. Authorities continued to detect swarms of earthquakes and the slight inflation of portions of the volcano, officials said, advising residents to stay indoors and to wear masks and goggles if they had to go outside.Public institutions, including schools, in many towns and cities were suspended on Monday, including in Manila, to avoid health risks posed by the ashfall. At least four Batangas towns reported power outages.Taal, one of the world’s smallest volcanoes, is among two dozen active volcanoes in the Philippines and lies along the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, a region prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4137548.1578850814!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"up to 1 000 electric bikes to be available for hire in dublin","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCustomers will be able to electronically unlock the bikes using an app on their smartphone which will also allow them to locate available bikes.  Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill  The Up to 1,000 electric bicycles will be available for hire on Dublin streets in the coming months with two separate companies due to launch similar operations in early Spring.Dublin City Council has said that two Irish companies, BleeperBike and Moby, will be licensed to hire out “pedelecs” (electrically assisted pedal cycles) throughout the capital.Unlike Dublin Bikes, the e-bikes will not be tied to specific docking stations but will be locked like regular bicycles at designated locations throughout the city.Customers will be able to electronically unlock the bikes using an app on their smartphone which will also allow them to locate available bikes.BleeperBike has already been in the market for more than a year, pioneering dockless bike rental in Dublin with some 450 non-electric bikes available throughout the city.Its founder and chief executive Hugh Cooney said it will introduce 150-200 e-bikes initially and will gradually increase the number as demand increases.The BleeperBike fleet will have replaceable batteries which can be switched for a fresh one when they have exhausted their charge.The second licensee, Moby, is an Irish tech company best known for its innovative electric-powered mobility devices. It won the second licence last summer to operate a dockless on-street hire service for e-bikes.According to Dublin City Council, Moby’s fleet of e-bikes, with bright yellow livery, is being tested ahead of its launch. The fleet will be comprised wholly of “pedelec” cycles.While the company could not be reached for comment on how many cycles it will make available, reports have suggested it would launch with about 250 bicycles.Mr Cooney of BleeperBike said that the operational area for the e-bikes will be the same as for its current service. It operates from UCD on the southside to DCU on the northside, as well as along the coast to Howth and Malahide.Average journey 3.5kmThe average journey length for a pedal cycle was about 3.5km, he said, but he expected electric-assisted bikes to be used for longer journeys, typically five to seven kilometres.The price point for e-bike rental was still being worked out, but Mr Cooney said it would be at least double the charge of a push-bike. BleeperBike currently charges a minimum of € 1 per journey on its service.Mr Cooney said he welcomed the fact that Moby was also entering the market. He said two operators in competition, both Irish-owned, would raise the profile of the service. He said the experiences in other cities throughout Europe showed e-bikes have had a transformative effect on urban and commuter travel.He pointed to countries like Germany where e-bikes now outsell traditional push cycles. “Inside the M50 there is potential for a fleet of 5,000 shared e-bikes in the long-term,” he said.The Irish operation of car share company Uber lobbied Dublin City Council chief executive Owen Keegan to introduce an e-bike share scheme in 2018. However, the council had already issued licences to BleeperBike, and to another company Urbo, to set up dockless sharing schemes for push bicycles.However, Urbo subsequently withdrew from the scheme. The council then sought new licence applications allowing e-bikes for the first time.The licences were then awarded to Bleeperbike and Moby. It is understood Uber did not apply for a licence.E-bike sharing schemes are well-established in cities throughout Europe and the United States. The two big players in the US are Uber, and its rival car-sharing company, Lyft, both of which have invested heavily in sharing operations for power-assisted travel, including e-scooters."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4137687.1578865715!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"all the focus in politics now on the first fortnight in february","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar slowly shifted his language from the previous strict adherence to his line that polling day should fall in May to saying he would call an election when it was the right time for the country. Photograph: Getty ImagesThe 32nd Dáil will have lasted almost four years by the time of the general election, a much longer period than most believed when the last election threw up its inconclusive result on February 26th, 2016. After those years of uncertainty, they now know an election will be held within weeks.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has made his call and, while not being definitive, clearly indicated on RTÉ’s This Week that he will dissolve the Dáil in the coming days for an early February general election. The signs that Varadkar was moving in this direction were evident since before Christmas, when he began to carve out the space to allow himself to go to the country earlier than his previous suggested date of May 2020. He slowly shifted his language from the previous strict adherence to his line that polling day should fall in May to saying he would call an election when it was the right time for the country. He then asked the impossible of Micheál Martin, asking that the Fianna Fáil leader should get his TDs to actually vote with the Government rather than abstain, as outlined in the confidence and supply agreement. Knowing his Fine Gael-minority government was on its last legs due to dwindling Dáil numbers, he prepared the ground for the announcement he is expected to make this week. UncertaintyPerhaps the Taoiseach was content to allow events of recent days – with Independent TDs shying away from supporting him and general uncertainty building momentum towards an election – play out. The past week has brought Varadkar to the destination he had likely settled on weeks ago: a general election campaign he hopes will be bookended by Brexit, what he on Sunday called “the big job of this Government”.He will travel to Belfast on Monday to meet British prime minister Boris Johnson, and Ursula von der Leyen, the new president of the European Commission, is in Dublin on Wednesday. If Varadkar opts for a February 7th election date, the UK will leave the EU one week out from polling day, and the issue will feature heavily in the final week of the campaign, when many voters make up their minds. On the issue of hospital beds, he said Fine Gael had “reversed” the cuts in health implemented by Fianna Fáil between 2007 and 2011, and added that he had worked with Brendan Howlin in the Fine Gael-Labour coalition of 2011-2016 to increase investment. His interview also prompted action across political parties and among Independent TDs and candidates. Many TDs had already begun a heavy canvass schedule, but others had held back. Considering their futureDecisions on whether to actually run at all will also be made by others in the coming days, with two members of the Independent Alliance considering their future.Minister of State for Disability Issues Finian McGrath is understood to be consulting his family and local organisation on whether he will stand again in Dublin Bay North, with sources close to the political veteran saying he is “50-50”. Minister of State for Skills John Halligan is also said to be considering whether to retire from political life and not seek to hold on to his Waterford seat.Fianna Fáil is expected to make a few further ticket changes this week, such as the addition of a candidate in Cork North Central, and the party announced that Dara Calleary, its deputy leader, will be director of elections. Fine Gael’s executive council will also add more candidates in some constituencies as all political focus now turns to the first fortnight in February."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4137524.1578848903!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"calls increase for dublin cycling network plan to be implemented","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe cycling network plan would see the number of segregated cycle routes in and around Dublin increase fivefold. Photograph:  Dara Mac DónaillCalls are increasing for the implementation of a cycling network in the greater Dublin area after two hospital chief executives recently said the capital “sorely needs” safer cycling infrastructure.First proposed by the National Transport Authority in 2013, the plan would see the number of segregated cycle routes in and around Dublin increase fivefold.In a joint letter to Minister for Transport Shane Ross, Lorcan Birthistle, chief executive of St James’s Hospital, and Eilish Hardiman, chief executive of Children’s Health Ireland, called for the plan to be established “without delay”.The two chief executives added that they aspire to be “cycle-friendly employers” but that they “also value the safety of our employees”.Biggest barrier“The lack of safe cycling infrastructure in Dublin city is the single biggest barrier to increasing the mode share of cyclists,” the letter states. “As acute hospitals we see directly at times tragic consequences of cyclists sharing the same roads infrastructure as cars and heavy duty vehicles.”The chief executives also highlighted the health benefits of increased cycling, such as a reduction in air pollution and an increase in physical activity.“As leading healthcare institutions we know that the increasing levels of inactivity amongst adults and children is alarming. Regular physical activity can help protect from serious diseases such as obesity, heart disease, cancer, mental illness, diabetes and arthritis,” the letter added.“Cycling is an ideal form of physical activity but the lack of safe cycling infrastructure is a significant barrier to increasing the uptake of such an active means of commuting.”The two hospital chiefs said the proposed plan will “serve to deliver the comprehensive and safe cycling infrastructure this city sorely needs”.The letter was written on December 5th, one month after cyclist Neeraj Jain (34) died following a collision with a cement truck at a junction to the back of St James’s Hospital and near the entrance of the new children’s hospital.Kevin Baker, chairman of the Dublin Cycling Campaign, said the time to develop the routes was now, and that it could no longer be put on the long finger.Segregated routes“The biggest thing preventing most people from taking up cycling is that the roads don’t feel safe,” Mr Baker said. “The number one thing we can do to make roads feel safe for people is to build proper, segregated cycle routes on main roads, and that’s what this plan does.”He said that the campaign group was “frustrated there hasn’t been more progress”, but added they are “cautiously optimistic” that authorities are beginning to act on the issue.A spokeswoman for the Department of Transport said that both the Minister and his department are committed to improving road safety, “particularly for those more vulnerable road users such as cyclists”.“In recent years there has been a significant increase in funding for improved active travel infrastructure in all our major cities,” the spokeswoman said. “This covers a wide range of projects including new segregated cycle lanes under the BusConnects programme, further separate funding for cycling as well as walking facilities, and additional funding for greenways projects.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4138031.1578913294!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"storm brendan nearly 10 000 without power as storm moves across country","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAtlantic Storm Brendan arrived over Ireland on Monday morning bringing gusts of almost 100kmh over counties in the northeast.

However, many schools reported waiting for the national warning to move from status orange to red before calling off classes on Monday. ‘Threat to life’ Monday’s orange warning for Connacht, Donegal and Kerry will remain in force until 9pm while the warning for Leinster, Cavan, Monaghan, Clare, Cork, Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford will be in place between 8am and 3pm.A status orange warning indicates conditions “may pose a threat to life and property,” with dangerous driving conditions and risk of falling trees.Winds are due to reach mean speeds of 65kmh to 80kmh, with gusts of up to 130kmh, and higher in exposed areas. The high winds will be accompanied by heavy rain which will develop in the west before spreading quickly across the country.A status red marine warning has also been issued.Also speaking on RTÉ, Met Éireann’s head of forecasting Evelyn Cusack warned that all areas in the country would experience storm force winds meaning ground saturation, localised flooding and the danger of uprooted trees and possibility of structural damage. While Storm Brendan, which originated off the coast of Canada, will pass over the country in a matter of hours, the north west will experience a “second blast” this afternoon, said Ms Cusack. “We are going to be getting several hours of very dangerous weather,” she warned.Flood barriersDublin City Council said flood defences had been erected while car parks at Clontarf and Sandymount are closed. It is expected the car parks will reopen later in the afternoon.Public access to the Great South Wall between 11am-4pm and the North Bull Wall Bridge between 12pm-2.30pm will remain closed as high tides and heavy rain reach the capital.Delays to some shipping activity is also expected, said Dublin Port Company.In Donegal the town pier was closed on Sunday evening ahead of the storm and will remain closed until Tuesday. In Sligo, the road to Strandhill Beach was closed while members of the public were advised to stay off piers and slipways. The Irish Coast Guard has advised the public to stay away from exposed beaches, cliffs, piers, promenades and harbours. “Breaking waves along the coast can be unpredictable and quickly drag you away,” it said.The National Parks and Wildlife Services (NPWS) advised the public not to visit any national parks, national monuments or nature reserves while the warnings are in place.Five locations will be closed, including Killarney House and Gardens in Co Kerry Dromore Woods Nature Reserve in Co Clare Coole Park \u0026amp Gardens Nature Reserve, Co Galway Connemara National Park, Co Galway and Knockma Woods Reserve in Tuam, Co Galway.Irish Ferries had not cancelled any Dublin-Holyhead crossing by 9.15am but advised travellers to keep an eye on sailing updates. In Cork, the cross river ferry service was suspended due to high winds while passengers travelling in the CobhPassage West area were advised to allow for extra time in their journeys. The Dursey Cable Car at the top of the Bear Peninsula is also closed on Monday. Cork Airport reported no major impact from the storm with all scheduled departures leaving on time. Dublin Airport said all airlines had indicated they would carry out a normal schedule on Monday but that operations would be weather dependent.However, Shannon Airport reported a number of cancellations including flights to and from Birmingham and London Heathrow. Danger to road usersCyclists have been urged to leave their bikes at home as cycling during the storm will be very dangerous due to intense rain and high winds.National director of the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management Sean Hogan told RTÉ that road conditions on Monday would be very dangerous with fallen power lines and trees expected. The Road Safety Authority appealed to road users to exercise caution travelling in high winds and issued advice to drivers including leaving extra space between road vehicles, particularly vulnerable road users such as cyclists and motorcyclists. The authority recommended that all motorists use dipped headlights at all time and not to drive through flooded routes. As flood warnings were put in place around the country, Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works (OPW) Kevin “Boxer” Moran announced government support for managing so called “pinch points” on the Shannon.Some €7 million has been allocated to manage potential flooding of the river between Athlone and Meelick Weir.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4138111.1578910902!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"trial of former solicitor michael lynn set for january 27th","story":"The trial date of former solicitor Michael Lynn on multi-million euro theft charges has been set for January 27th, the Courts Service has confirmed.Mr Lynn, who was last year extradited from Brazil to face the charges, left the country after the economic collapse. He is alleged to have stolen almost €30 million from Irish financial institutions.Sample charges include the theft of €4.1 million from Irish Nationwide on April 4th, 2007 and €3.6 million from Ulster Bank on October 20th, 2006. Mr Lynn was arrested in Brazil, and spent more than four years on remand as he fought the Government’s attempts to secure extradition.In total, Mr Lynn (50) is charged with 21 counts of stealing money from seven different financial institutions.In December, the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal taken against a High Court ruling by Mr Lynn. Ahead of his extradition, Brazilian authorities had sought assurances from Ireland that his time in prison there would be deducted from his sentence were he found guilty in Ireland, and that his sentence would not exceed 30 years. Such assurances are part of the Brazilian extradition process.AssurancesHe had argued unsuccessfully in the High Court that the assurances could not be given by the state due to the constitutional separation of powers. However, he lost the High Court case and the Court of Appeal then dismissed his appeal. Three Supreme Court judges determined the issues of the case had been adequately addressed in the High Court and Court of Appeal.Mr Lynn has claimed he needs ongoing treatment for severe mental trauma due to the conditions he endured in Cotel prison in the Brazilian city of Recife, where he was held on remand. He has claimed he faced death threats and extortion while there.The Co Mayo solicitor expanded into property developments in Ireland, and then later abroad, during the economic boom through his company, Kendar Holdings. Overseas investments opportunities were promoted by the company, including attention-grabbing stunts such as giving an apartment in a Bulgarian ski resort away on The Late Late Show and endorsements from celebrities such as Portuguese footballer Rui Costa.A Law Society investigation resulted in his practice being closed in October 2007. He was later struck off the roll of solicitors. He owed banks and investors more than €80 million at the time he left the country.

Internal Fine Gael speculation suggests an election date of Friday, February 7th, although the following Friday, February 14th, is also mentioned. Mr Varadkar, however, has not given indications on his exact plans. Political speculation also suggested he could seek a dissolution of the Dáil from President Michael D Higgins on Wednesday or Thursday.Mr Varadkar will meet British prime minister Boris Johnson in Belfast on Monday, where the pair are expected to discuss the restored Stormont institutions, British-Irish relations and the future trading relationship. He will also meet First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill.

But it is only possible if it is managed well and the public finances are managed well and we are the people who are best placed to do that, not the people who failed to do it in the past.” ‘Dream of home ownership’Mr Martin told The  there will be “an avalanche of Fine Gael spin” over the coming weeks.“But some core facts cannot be spun and will form the foundation of this election,” he said. “A whole generation of people have seen the dream of home ownership slip away. And all across the country families are simply terrified at the prospect of their loved ones having to be admitted to hospital because of the record numbers of people on trolleys and the lack of support for those working on the front line.”In a sign of sparring likely to feature in the campaign, a Government Minister described some members of the Green Party as “nutters”.Minister of State for Local Government John Paul Phelan made the comments in a speech at an IFA dinner in his native Kilkenny on Saturday night.According to one source present, Mr Phelan said: “There are lots of good people in the Green Party, but some are nutters.”In response, Green Party Dublin Rathdown TD Catherine Martin said: “That is language unbecoming of a Minister.

File photograph: Tom HonanThe .Former British prime minister John Major stepped in to stop plans for a service commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Irish Famine in 1996 amid fears it would ignite debate about a UK apology for its role.Discussions were ongoing between the Northern Ireland Office and Foreign and Commonwealth Office about holding an ecumenical service in Liverpool during a visit by then president Mary Robinson in June 1996. The church service would also have been attended by a senior member of the royal family as well as Mr Major.Despite backing by then secretary of state for Northern Ireland Patrick Mayhew, the plan was mothballed by the prime minister and his private secretary, citing fears of what the reaction would be from nationalist and unionist communities.The exchange of ideas is shown in correspondence released by the National Archives in London as part of the annual release of historical state papers. The debate about the commemoration came shortly after the IRA ended a 17-month ceasefire.“The prime minister is very dubious about taking this proposal forward, and not only in the present climate. Whatever we say, government (and arguably royal) attendance at such a service would look like an apology for the famine and revive debate about whether we owe such an apology,” said Mr Major’s private secretary Edward Oakden in a letter to a colleague at the foreign office.“Is it sensible to be doing this at any time, and especially during President Robinson’s visit to which it would introduce controversy? The Unionists are unlikely to sympathise and Nationalist appetites seem more likely to be whetted than allayed. The prime minister would rather therefore that the proposal were not for the moment pursued. He would certainly not plan to attend himself.”What was said in private?Mr Oakden had been much more scathing of the idea in private, describing the reasons for it as “loony” in a memo to Mr Major.“Whatever we say, such a service, never mind your attendance at it, would look like an apology. These events happened 150 years ago. They are history. This is not equivalent to the Taoiseach’s attendance at the War Memorial on VE Day. The Unionist reaction can be imagined. And it would not satisfy the Nationalists. More likely, it would revive arguments about whether the UK should apologise, and add controversy to President Robinson’s visit,” he wrote.Mrs Robinson was invited to Britain on an official visit by Mr Major, and had lunch with Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Edward, preceded by an inspection of the guard of honour at Buckingham Palace.Despite potato blight being considered the immediate cause of the famine which killed more than a million people and led millions to emigrate in the 1840s, the inadequacy of the British government’s response and export of Irish-grown food continue to be a matter of controversy."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4138086.1578909955!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"kevin boxer moran to leave independent alliance","story":"Kevin ‘Boxer’ Moran, the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works (OPW) has announced he is leaving the Independent Alliance.In an interview with Shannonside Radio on Monday the Longford-Westmeath TD said he will be standing in the next election as an outright Independent, rather than under the banner of the Independent Alliance.Mr Moran said if he is re-elected he may join a new political grouping in the new Dáil.The Independent Alliance was set up principally by Minister for Transport Shane Ross before the last election and was Fine Gael’s main coalition partner for the last four years.It currently has four Ministers: Mr Ross, Mr Moran, Minister of State for Disability Issues Finian McGrath and Minister of State for Skills John Halligan.Mr McGrath is considering whether to stand again in Dublin Bay North but is expected to do so, while Mr Halligan is expected to announce later this week that he will not seek re-election in his Waterford constituency.It effectively means the Independent Alliance has come to an end."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4137418.1578841130!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"megxit markle should wield her wokeness where it matters buckingham palace","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex leave Westminster Abbey in London after attending a Commonwealth Day service last March. Photograph: Ben StansallAFPI never had much use for the queen. Maybe it’s the Irish in me. As Winston Churchill said: “We’ve always found the Irish a bit odd. They refuse to be English.” Or maybe it’s the American in me. We did go to an awful lot of trouble to break away from that corgi-and-gin-loving racket 244 years ago. At some visceral level, though, America must regret being torn away from the royal family. How else to explain our enduring fascination with dynasties? Having spent my career covering four dysfunctional political dynasties, I rebel more than ever at the idea that biology entitles you to authority.The ghost of Diana gone rogue animates the fractured fairy tale of Meghan and Harry, and their intemperate attempt to upend centuries of starchy rules and break away from the Firm. Princess Di’s dangerous tango with the tabloids left Harry with no taste to play that game again, especially with streaks of racism against Markle added to the mix. He recently confessed that every click or flash of a camera brought memories of his mother’s death racing back into his mind.US visitI covered Diana’s first trip as the Princess of Wales to America in 1985. She seemed happy then, in that year before Charles resumed his relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles. She and the prince shared amused eye contact, winks and teasing remarks.Nancy Reagan planned an evening of candlelit dancing at the White House worthy of a 24-year-old Cinderella in a midnight blue velvet gown. The first lady arranged for the Marine Band to play Night Fever as John Travolta spun a euphoric Diana around the floor. (“She’s a great little mover,” he said afterwards.)I wondered how Prince Charles would deal with a young wife with so much star power, absorbing so much attention. We were all mesmerised when she tucked her chin down in that shy pose and cast that modest yet saucy look up at us. The answer was: he did not deal with it well. Twelve years later, when the unimaginable tragedy hit, the royal ice cubes were furious at the expectation that they should emote for the woman who had publicly ripped the monarchy as a bloodless, soulless gang and christened herself the Prisoner of Wales.The Firm was out of its depth then, and it is again now. How can the queen and Prince Philip and Prince Charles possibly understand the desire of Meghan and Harry to rebrand as a Goopish lifestyle enterprise? The news that they have applied to trademark hundreds of items, from socks to hoodies, under the “Sussex Royal” logo makes Wallis Simpson’s exile in the Bahamas, spent matching the colour on the walls to her face powder, seem positively monastic.Can you really call yourself “financially independent” when all you’re doing is cashing in on the royal name? Given the state of the world and the implosion of the British empire – with Scots once more contemplating an off ramp, Irish unity in play, Australia on fire and Boris Johnson tricking the queen into suspending parliament in a Brexit ploy – it is hard to feel sorry for the Duchess of Sussex complaining that her diamonds are heavy. The pathos for Markle, trapped in a designer cage, goes only so far.It’s easy for royals to come to North America, where they are lavishly embraced as celebrities without all those pesky restrictions about class and role. (See The Crown episode about a wild, imbibing Princess Margaret charming LBJ.) Still, I think Meghan Markle should have wielded her wokeness where it is most needed – in Buckingham Palace. She could have channelled the Obamas, who did a magnificent job of rising above racist taunts and working within the institution to imprint a new image of racial possibility in America.Markle had already successfully brought a refreshing dose of semi-radical chic to the royal family. Her visits to a mosque that housed Londoners displaced by the Grenfell Tower fire led to her putting out a 2018 cookbook, the proceeds of which went to the victims.Irish visitAt its best, the monarchy has been able to lift up people, as it did during the blitz in the second World War. I saw that ability to alchemise emotions and opinions when I covered the queen on her visit to Ireland in 2011, the first by a British monarch in a century. It was impossible not to be impressed watching her speak Irish and offering regret about how Britain had made Ireland suffer, bowing her head at the scene of Bloody Sunday and the Garden of Remembrance, the sacred ground for slain Irish patriots.The Irish started out sceptical, but by the end of her visit, many were calling her “Betty” on Twitter. The queen of England holds out the idea that she and her family should have some sort of vestigial moral authority. But with the Prince Andrew imbroglio in the seraglio of Jeffrey Epstein, and with Harry’s run for the Hollywood Hills, it is clear that many in her family are not interested in moral authority.The collapse of the authority of the British monarchy mirrors the collapse of authorities generally, scarred by years of scandals about clergymen abusing children, athletes beating up girlfriends and university officials accepting bribes. And yet, even if the royals’ role in the culture is now akin to the Kardashians, it wasn’t cool for Meghan and Harry to pants the 93-year-old queen, defy her instructions, dump their Megxit plan on Instagram and intensify the sad split between the brothers.

His home had been flattened in the massive earthquake which hit Haiti ten years ago on Sunday, killing over 300,000 people. He heard word that there was space to live up in the hills, in an area on the outskirts of Port au Prince known as Canaan.And so he collected the remnants of his life in the impoverished Delmas 4 district, and moved up into the hills with his family.“But there was nothing here,” he recalls. “We arrived, and there was no one from the government. So we just asked around to find a free spot, and called it our own. We just had to guess how big an area we could claim.”The 7.0 magnitude earthquake that rocked Haiti 10 years ago wiped out almost a fifth of government employees, and left 1.5 million homeless.Cholera broke out, introduced to the country by UN peacekeepers, which killed 10,000 people and infected 800,000 more.Aid money poured into the Caribbean nation, and Bill Clinton – who spent his 1975 honeymoon with Hillary in Haiti – was made co-chair of the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission (IHRC). Sean Penn became the unofficial mayor of a homeless camp Oprah Winfrey and Kim Kardashian jetted in to see for themselves.The fallout from the 2010 earthquake continues todayTen years later, Haitians shake their heads sadly and wonder where it all went wrong.There was so much energy, attention, and money - $13 billion (£10bn) promised in the years 2010-20, of which half was actually distributed. An additional $3 billion was contributed to UN agencies and NGOs by private donors, meaning that the $9 billion in aid was three times the revenue of the government of Haiti between 2010 and 2012.Yet 35,000 people still live in temporary accommodation, according to the International Organisation of Migration. In reality the figure is likely to be significantly higher, as people are classed as being housed even when living in a shack  Canaan is still home to around 200,000 people, who still don’t have running water or electricity.“They wanted us to move here, but they didn’t help us,” said Mr Appolos, 52, with a shrug.He founded a school in the new community, built from plywood and corrugated iron, and funded entirely from donations made by Haitians living in the area. Now 300 students attend his tiny make-shift study centre.Half-built houses litter the hillsides many began building, but run out of money to complete it. A small one-room breezeblock building would cost around $1,000 to make, he estimated.Haiti was initially flooded with celebrities and goodwill, but much of the promised money has failed to materialise“It’s been very, very hard to find a way to build,” he said. “We had to do it all ourselves.”When the earthquake hit, Enancy Bienaime\u0027s house folded on top of her like it was made of playing cards. For three hours she was trapped in the rubble her desperate cries eventually led neighbours to dig her out. For two years she then lived in a tent – one of thousands pitched on the marshy wastelands on the outskirts of Haiti’s capital, Port au Prince.“Life has only got worse since then,” she said.She showed The  the corrugated iron shed where she now lives with her husband and two children, built on the site of their former home.That house, in Cite Soleil, the largest slum in the northern hemisphere, was built in the 1950s by Voodoo doctor Francois Papa Doc Duvalier, who ruled the country with an iron fist for 15 years. Now it is home to 265,000 people, crammed into an area only eight miles square and without sewers, running water or social services. A fetid, rubbish-filled canal provides the only drainage, and frequently floods into the slums. Pigs wallow in the mud, and squeal inside the ruins which still line the streets.“This house is terrible, even compared to my previous one,” said Mrs Bienaime, 35. “It’s so hot, with the corrugated iron roof. And I know it could topple at any time. I’m constantly frightened.”A man sells ice cream to children in the Carradeux communityThe earthquake and its immense challenges created huge political problems, which have fuelled the rise of gangs across the country. The gangs are paid by political and business interests, to corral votes or control a zone fights for territory are fierce.Cite Soleil is among the most hotly-contested territory for the gangs. “There are nine year olds around here with guns,” said Mrs Bienaime. “My one year old daughter has seen so many shootings she now makes a pistol sign with her fingers, and a ‘pow, pow’ noise. It breaks my heart. I’m desperate to move away from here.”Kwanli Kladstrup, country director for Irish NGO Concern, runs a programme to help reduce the risks of natural disasters, ensure the protection of children, and build sustainable livelihoods. Her team proudly tell how they educate their community about surviving earthquakes and hurricanes, demonstrating hiding under tables, and sheltering in doorways.A woman walks past the ruins of Notre Dame Cathedral during Haiti\u0026#39s 10th earthquake anniversary“There have been some improvements since the earthquake, but the endemic poverty continues to push people to the limit of their coping abilities, and hinder progress,” she said.She points out that hunger is a very real problem. OCHA, the UN humanitarian agency, estimates that four million people will need emergency food rations by March.“We have to focus on increasing investment in sustainable food systems and agriculture, and developing local markets to raise productivity,” she said.Janvier Junior, 33, agreed. Born in the slum, he has never seen things so bad. Rampant inflation coupled with rising unemployment have made an already tough life almost impossible.“We really thought, after the earthquake, that we’d have a fresh start,” he said. “We hoped some of the money would be put to good use.

Yet all economies are vulnerable to threats to the global trading system. That’s why our manifesto commitments on trade must be a pre-eminent strategic priority for this empowered Conservative government.Our manifesto pledged parallel trade talks with the EU, the US, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, aiming to cover 80 per cent of UK trade with free trade deals in the next three years. This whole-UK, whole-world policy is exactly the right approach and Liz Truss has done brilliantly to secure it.But deep dangers are ahead. By linking access to its markets with demands for regulatory harmonisation, the EU makes itself a global outlier. We need immediately to end the UK’s timid Eurocentrism by negotiating simultaneously with independent, free-trading partners. Accepting the export of EU power would deepen our recent humiliation as we succumbed to be a mere regulatory satellite, unable to join old friends as equal partners.Brexit | The best comment and analysisIn meeting ambassadors and their teams, I have found categorical differences of approach. Our European partners regard our decision to leave the EU with bewilderment. It has been necessary to reassure them that, overwhelmingly, Tory Eurosceptics are free traders with an expansive view of prosperity and our friendship with the world, that we reject technocracy and have faith in the collective wisdom of the people, expressed in the markets for products, services, culture, ideas and public policy.In contrast, our friends in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the US are fearless in accepting our commitment to civilised values, impatient in their desire to see us become international equals and, if they are bewildered, it is only because we have been hesitant in reorienting ourselves to the global outlook we have chosen. These old friends outside the EU are those we need most right now.As Woody Johnson, the US Ambassador to London, recently reminded us, America is the world’s largest economy, offering huge potential to our businesses. They are ready to negotiate, they are prioritising us and the window for success is closing as the US heads into presidential elections. That is why this Government must fully commit to parallel trade talks, immediately prioritising the US. The day for action on US trade is the day we leave the EU.A myriad of objections explode into view. Of course, we won’t sell the NHS but we do need to earn the funds to pay for it. Yes, food in the US is good to eat and we must be unafraid to say so. And no, the US is not protectionist but they do wish to avoid importing other countries’ anti-competitive practices. They are right in that: a CEBR report last year showed domestic market distortions are of greater magnitude than international trade distortions.Brexit Schedule 2020 | December transition deadline is key for the poundWhen the EU demands level playing field provisions, we must agree the UK will not distort our markets artificially to secure advantages that ordinary commercial processes should yield. But this cannot mean harmonisation.In a progressive society, improvement comes from trial and error, not perfect foresight. Regulatory competition is essential to discover the best ways to secure the best outcomes for consumers, especially for the poorest, who cannot afford to game the system. We must recognise that neither socialists nor our European Commission friends will choose to accept that approach. They evidently believe in power and exporting it.That’s why our greatest friends are the Americans. They too fundamentally believe in liberty, that pioneering spirit that rises above mere materialism, along with ambition and courage and the hope that a better future is there, not merely to be discovered, but to be created through the energies of an entrepreneurial people seeking tirelessly to serve others for profit and moral sentiment. Our old allies in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Japan are with us too and we must stride forward together, but none surpass the power of the US to achieve change for good.Boris Johnson has the policy we need. He has the power to deliver it.

Mr\u0026nbspMuilenburg also has stock options that could be worth many millions more.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“We thank Dennis for his nearly 35 years of service to the Boeing Company,” the company said in a statement. “Upon his departure, Dennis received the benefits to which he was contractually entitled and he did not receive any severance pay or a 2019 annual bonus.”Boeing’s new chief executive, David Calhoun, will receive a $7m (£5.3m)\u0026nbspbonus if he is able to get the 737 Max, which has been grounded since March, safely flying again.

Are you working for free from now on until you can cure this problem?” Representative Stephen Cohen\u0026nbspasked Mr Muilenburg at one point. “These people’s relatives are not coming back. They’re gone. Your salary is still on.”Mr Muilenburg went pale, noting that the board determines his pay.After the hearings, Mr Muilenburg called Mr Calhoun, then the Boeing chair, and offered to forgo any compensation until the Max had fully returned to service. Speaking at a New York Times conference soon after that, Mr Muilenburg said he decided to give up “tens of millions of dollars” after meeting with families of victims of the crashes.How can I make sure I avoid the Boeing 737 Max?“I felt it was important for me to forgo those bonuses and send a message of responsibility,” he said.Boeing said Mr Calhoun, who starts as chief executive Monday, would receive a base salary of $1.4m (£1m) and be eligible for an annual target bonus of $2.5m (£1.9m), long-term incentive awards worth $7.5m (£5.7m) and restricted stock units worth $10m\u0026nbsp(£7.6m).Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The question: had returning war hero Sgt Brody (Damian Lewis) been radicalised in a foreign jail cell? CIA officer Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) thought so, but she had plenty of problems of her own. I still think it would have been better if he\u0027d detonated at the denouement. Twisty, compelling, briefly essential. (EC)The slow-burning relationship between Cathy (Lesley Manville), a widow and mother of superhuman forbearance, and her late husband’s best pal Michael (Peter Mullan) elevated what could have been a run-of-the-mill suburban comedy into a beautifully composed portrait of friendship, grief and mid-life romance. (FS)Hulu’s adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s 1985 novel, set in a pious patriarchal state, lost its way in the second series, but the first, which arrived a few months after Trump entered the White House, was a triumph. As Offred, Elisabeth Moss seethed under her mask of impassivity, while the rich palette gave us a dystopian nightmare as imagined by the 17th-century Dutch school. (FS)Perhaps the trashiest show on this list, but trash of the highest grade, Money Heist is Netflix\u0027s most popular non-English series, a hit across Europe and South America, with 34m accounts watching this year\u0027s Part 3 in its first week of release. A mysterious mastermind known as The Professor gathers together a crew of misfit criminals to execute a robbery on the Royal Mint in Spain. Tense, funny, clever and often completely preposterous, La Casa del Papel has only been held back by its off-putting English title. (EC)530 26. Rick and Morty (2013- ) It unfortunately inspired some of the worst fans on the internet, but that shouldn\u0027t detract from Rick and Morty\u0027s inventiveness. Ostensibly a parody of Back to the Future, about the adventures of a young boy and his alcoholic, mad scientist grandfather, the cartoon uses its set-up to put its heroes in an endless number of frenetic, frequently insane situations. Blink and you miss a gag and two pop-culture references. (EC)This exquisite French series is about the dead trying to return to their old lives in a secluded mountain town dispensed with the usual gory zombie tropes, instead dwelling on the human instincts of these confused beings – specifically their desire to love and be loved ­– and the grief experienced by those they left behind. (FS)Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney were a masterful double act in this sitcom about a holiday fling resulting in an unplanned pregnancy. The pair’s attempts to build a life together yielded scabrous gags about sex and post-partum leakage, a cameo from the late Carrie Fisher and an underlying tenderness that resisted spilling into sentimentality. (FS)A wicked cocktail of comedy and humanity, shock and gore, the first series of Killing Eve, written by Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was a subversive joy. Sandra Oh and Jodie Comer played, respectively, a spy and an assassin whose continental game of cat-and-mouse was a blood-spattered love story for the ages. Sadly, when Waller-Bridge handed off writing duties in the second series, the magic wasn\u0027t quite the same. (FS)The Killing may have started the Scandi craze, but it aired in Denmark in 2007, so it doesn\u0027t count for these purposes. Borgen was everything The West Wing wasn\u0027t: a cliché-resistant drama that showed politics in grating reality, with plenty of plausible schemers in slick outfits and a wonderful central performance by Sidse Babett Knudsen as Birgitte Nyborg, the Prime Minister trying to balance principles with power. (EC)Following the exploits of Lance (Toby Jones) and Andy (Mackenzie Crook), dedicated treasure hunters and members of the Danebury Metal Detecting Club, Detectorists was about people and their passions, community and camaraderie. It’s a wonderfully tranquil meditation on male companionship. (FS)Where other series burn brightly and fade after a couple of years, FX\u0027s Cold War spy drama took its time. Matthew Rhys and Kerri Russell, married in real life, shone as the Russian couple working as spies in suburban Washington DC. The tension built over six seasons to a magnificent finale, rewarding those who stuck with it. (EC)The premise is one of the most intriguing in television: people struggling to come to terms with something called the Sudden Departure, a mysterious event in whichtwo per cent of the world\u0027s population simply disappeared. Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta\u0027s drama received iffy reviews at first, but its reputation grew through its second and final outings, with writing and performances that explored the full depth of the setup without losing the pervasive air of mystery. (EC)The third series is a noticeable drop-off in quality, but for two series The Crown achieved a number of unexpected feats. It made viewers genuinely interested in the Royal Family, and not in a Prince Andrew should they go to prison? kind of way. With sumptuous sets and costumes and some excellent performances, especially Claire Foy as the young monarch, this remains the high-water mark of Netflix polish – proof that money can, sometimes, buy you love. (EC)Reports of the death of TV’s baking behemoth have been greatly exaggerated: despite host departures, a channel move and the off-screen antics of a certain perma-tanned judge, this big-hearted competition in which friendships are forged and adults weep over sagging soufflés remains the ultimate feel-good reality show. (FS)Two men bicker over bottles of fine wine. Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon’s low-key, semi-improvised and implausibly funny tours of high-end European restaurants saw the pair’s insecurities deliciously laid bare as they discussed sex, ageing and ambition. Michael Winterbottom directed. (FS)This Yorkshire-set, Bafta-festooned series gave us Catherine Cawood (Sarah Lancashire), a pleasingly complex, no-nonsense police sergeant up to her neck in rapists, murderers, addicts and the odd ailing sheep, together with some superbly earthy dialogue courtesy of writer Sally Wainwright. (FS)Without Girls there is no Fleabag or Adam Driver, and it would probably merit inclusion on those two facts alone. But Lena Dunham now attracts as much opprobrium as praise, and it\u0027s easy to forget how new her breakthrough comedy felt in its naturalistic depiction of young women in New York. This was Sex and the City for people who spent more time on Instagram than at work, created by people the same age as those they were portraying. Its look and feel have cast a long shadow. (EC)Witty, inventive and dazzling to look at, Steven Moffatt and Mark Gatiss’s relocation of the Arthur Conan Doyle stories to the present day worked beautifully, as did the casting of Benedict Cumberbatch as the “high-functioning sociopath” Holmes and Martin Freeman as the put-upon army veteran Watson. While later series would drift, the first three were unbeatable. (FS)A five-part drama about a nuclear disaster in 1986 is not the most promising prospect for a night in with a bottle of wine. It is a tribute to the writer, Craig Mazin, and director, Johan Renck, as well as its cast, especially Jared Harris, that Chernobyl managed to be totally gripping, with frequent moments of stark, horrendous beauty. (EC)At first, the musician and comedian Donald Glover\u0027s series about struggling rappers in Atlanta looked like a familiar, safe kind of sitcom about loveable losers. But it quickly evolved into something fresh: a smart, occasionally surreal examination of life at the margins of America, whose angry heart never spilled into preachiness or got in the way of the jokes. (EC)Who could have anticipated a dating show in which twenty-somethings sit around in microscopic swimwear would tell us so much about the human condition? Gaslighting, bromances, the complexities of “girl code” – Love Island delved beneath the spray tans and schooled the nation on modern manners. (FS)An electrifying study of addiction, trauma and the corrupting power of privilege, based on the autobiographical books by Edward St Aubyn. Benedict Cumberbatch played the feckless antihero grappling with his past and trying (and mostly failing) to be better than the wretched aristos that raised him. (FS)Ken Burns\u0027s epic 10-part documentary followed up his other conflict opuses, on The Civil War and The War, with a detailed story about Vietnam. Using new interviews from both sides as well as archive footage, the documentary shows in unrelenting detail a catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion. Some critics accused it of underserving the experience of the Vietnamese civilians. But it left viewers in no doubt that not only did the US leadership pursue it long after it was a lost cause, but they knew from the start it was unwinnable. (EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income.

(EC)Charlie Brooker sent every other TV critic, or at least one of them, into a spiral of envy by proving not only that it was possible to cross over into creation, but to do so in style. Black Mirror\u0027s taut near-future tales of techno-dystopia are almost always interesting, even if they sometimes fall short of their ambitions, as with the high-concept recent film, Bandersnatch. The best episodes, like 2016\u0027s tour de force, San Junipero, are gripping examinations of human connection in a world where interactions are increasingly by screens. (EC)The first of the Attenborough documentaries to speak directly of the human impact on the natural world, this kaleidoscopic ocean odyssey provided a visual feast of clam-cracking tuskfish, alien-looking pyrosomes and anthropomorphic ­dolphins, while reminding us how it could all be lost. (FS)Only in a world of Netflix budgets can you imagine a concept as wild as BoJack Horseman’s getting off the ground. It\u0027s a cartoon set in LA, ostensibly a comedy about celebrity, except half the characters, including its lead, are anthropomorphised animals. Halfway through its final season, which has been split into two, its initial zaniness has given way to something darker and more interesting. Lurid colours and visual wit dress one of the most humane explorations of depression, addiction and cycles of abuse. (EC) What began, in its first series, as an enjoyably acid-tongued portrait of modern womanhood became a fully fledged masterpiece in the second. Written by and starring Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Fleabag gave us perfectly calibrated scenes of familial dysfunction and sexual longing – the latter memorably culminating in the Priest’s simple, thrilling instruction: “Kneel.” (FS)The first spin-off series from Shane Meadows’ 2007 film, about a gang of ex-skinheads from the Midlands, was set during the 1986 World Cup, and remains one of the great British dramas, depicting working class lives with humanity and humour. This is England ’88 and ’90 followed, both of them similarly infused with heart and soul. (FS)Said to have been a decade in the making, Succession is worth every minute spent on it. Brian Cox enjoys a dream of a late-career role as Logan Roy, the ageing media tycoon unwilling to relinquish control of his company to any of his ungrateful and talentless children. There\u0027s oblivious eldest son Connor (Alan Ruck), troubled addict Kendall (Jeremy Strong), scheming daughter Shiv (Sarah Snook) and abrasive youngest Roman (Kieran Culkin), along with a host of hangers-on, partners and support staff. None of them seem to have the right stuff. It\u0027s an intriguing set-up, but Succession is lifted by its script, performances, locations, costumes, music and direction, which place it firmly in a tradition of laughing at our rulers, where the mirth comes tempered with the knowledge that these are really the people in charge. (EC)3030 1. Game of Thrones (2011-2019)Yes, the final series went a bit weird. Maybe the final two series. A case could be made that the TV adaptation was never as emotionally resonant when it went beyond George RR Martin\u0027s novels. The final series were only disappointing compared to what had come before, which was a fantasy on an unprecedented scale that managed to be grandiose without slipping into melodrama. An invented universe with necromancers, dragons, magic swords and ice zombies was notable for its plausible realpolitik. At a time when viewing tastes were meant to be becoming more atomised, Game of Thrones was global event TV, which made household names of the Starks, Lannisters and Greyjoys and provided a whole generation of English character actors with a regular income. (EC)Princess Margaret would have been married to photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones, the\u0026nbspEarl of Snowdon, in 1970. They orced to much negative publicity\u0026nbspin 1978.Cox added: “It was so funny. James Bolam, he could see what was going on and started going ‘Ooooh’ out of the side of his mouth, which somehow said princess didn’t take in at all. She just kept saying: ‘You were so wonderfully hooded on stage. I wanted to know more about you…’ She was an extraordinary creature. I excused myself and said: ‘Thank you, ma’am,’ and it came to a natural end.”The actor also discussed the Prince Andrew scandal in the interview,\u0026nbspin the context of entitlement – a key theme in dynasty drama Succession.“I mean, what an idiot,” he said. “What an outstanding dumb f***. ‘I don’t know who that young woman was, and I don’t sweat.’ It’s ridiculous! I’m so cross with the idiocy of what we allow. It just shows how ridiculous the notion of monarchy is.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

When the chain announced that it was on the brink of falling over in the absence of a buyer or an investor, the natural reaction was to dial up a certain Queen song.\u0026nbspYou can probably already hear that thumping baseline and Freddie Mercury intoning “another one bites the dust” in your head. If the ear worm is with you for the rest of the day, my apologies.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe reports of the retailer’s troubles dovetail with some research from Colliers International, a real estate adviser that’s been keeping an eye on Company Voluntary Arrangements (CVAs), a form of bankruptcy that’s proved quite popular with retailers.\u0026nbspThey’ve been used as a means of addressing some of the problems Beales boss Tony Brown identified on the BBC’s Today programme: high rents and the need to close unprofitable stores on long leases to cope with a trading environment mired in an ice age.\u0026nbspBoost for retailers as Carney hints at interest rate cutMost adults think retailers use too much packaging, poll claimsPrimark and Boohoo CEOs top most powerful people in fashion listCreditors, including landlords, are typically presented with a restructuring proposal that includes the closure of some stores together with reduced rents at those that remain. If a majority agree - 75 per cent is required - the minority has to lump it.\u0026nbspThese tend to be a lot harder on smaller landlords, often in the sort of places that Beales calls home, than the big ones that dominate the prime locations in big cities. They are also highly controversial in the property businesses.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspColliers added fuel to that fire. It found that out of 23 retailers that underwent a CVA from 2016 onwards, 13 of them went on to fail. They\u0026nbspended up in administration with the CVA thus serving as little more than “sticking plaster” that delayed the inevitable.\u0026nbspThe problem for landlords is that every time a client forces a rent reduction through a CVA, their other clients start queueing up to demand the same thing, some threatening CVAs of their own.\u0026nbspThere is a more optimistic way of looking at Colliers’ figures. It is that ten businesses came out the other side.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is something we should be open and honest about. Brushing it under the carpet will not get us closer to solving the issue.Brexit campaign had ‘racism at heart’, says Labour leader contenderUnfortunately, calling things how they are has not been a quality which we have come to expect from many in positions of responsibility on these matters. People who should know better are too quick to spout to politically correct mantras and too slow to call out problems in certain communities, hindering our ability to get to the bottom of the issue and leaving many residents and victims feeling like they don\u0027t have a voice.Continuing to link crime to immigrant communities, he\u0026nbspcriticised people who say we should be eternally tolerant of bad behaviour which may be rife in other countries but is not traditionally in ours and said integration must include learning English, respecting women and obeying \u2028our laws.Responding to the claims, a spokesperson\u0026nbspfor the\u0026nbspIpswich and Suffolk Council for Racial Equality (ISCRE) condemned the article as entirely evidence-free.They said: The recent article on the topic of crime in the EADT by the newly-elected MP for Ipswich is at best disappointing and at worst an ill-judged piece of dogwhistling.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some said it was a potentially positive step for democracy – a sign, as Donald Trump put it, that the will of the people will always prevail.\u0026nbspA sharply different response came from senator Bernie Sanders, who immediately condemned what appears to be a coup. The ousted leader, Evo Morales, who had challenged term limits to remain in power, later thanked the senator from Vermont and Democratic\u0026nbsppresidential candidate, referring to him affectionately as brother.Most of Mr Sanders\u0027 rivals paid little attention to the incident in a faraway place. But for Mr Sanders, the episode offered a glimpse into an unorthodox foreign policy worldview – anchored by a passionate opposition to US\u0026nbspmilitary interventions – that has been overshadowed by his famously liberal domestic policy agenda.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWith the Iran crisis thrusting foreign affairs to the forefront of the campaign, just as Mr Sanders rises in early state polls, Democrats who previously waved off the senator\u0027s views as fringe ideas now must contemplate the possibility of a democratic socialist becoming commander in chief of the United States. Mr Trump has already upended the world order with an America First approach that tests Western alliances, and Mr Sanders would deliver another jolt – echoing some of Mr Trump\u0027s criticisms of military actions and free trade but realigning the country\u0027s priorities even more thoroughly.Beyond his objection to Mr Morales\u0027 removal, Mr Sanders has pointedly declined to label Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro a dictator. He called Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu a racist, and has campaigned with representatives\u0026nbspRashida Tlaib\u0026nbspand Ilhan Omar\u0026nbspvocal supporters of a controversial Israel boycott movement. He said China has done more to address extreme poverty than any country in the history of civilisation.Created with Sketch.US airstrike kills Iran\u0027s Qassem Soleimani: Fallout in pictures Show all 35Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.This photo released by the Iraqi Prime Minister Press Office shows a burning vehicle at the Baghdad International Airport following an airstrike in Baghdad, Iraq, early Friday 3 JanuaryThe wreckage of the car in which general Soleimani was travelling when a targeted US airstrike struck outside Baghdad International Airport on 3 JanuaryDemonstrators burn the US and British flags during a protest in Tehran after general Soleimani was killed in a targeted airstrike by American forcesA burning vehicle at the Baghdad International Airport following an airstrike.

You\u0027ve had a consensus in this country on certain principles. Joe Biden represents that consensus. And to a degree, Obama as well.Even some Democrats note that Mr Sanders has put much more emphasis on domestic policies than global ones. It hasn\u0027t been his strong suit, senator\u0026nbspRichard Durbin said of Mr Sanders\u0027 foreign policy.\u0026nbspMr Sanders and his supporters say he\u0027s been right on foreign policy far more than the supposed experts, and that the establishment is responsible for a series of misguided military adventures. Besides, they say, Mr Sanders\u0027 positions are often more nuanced than he\u0027s given credit for – he has criticised Mr Morales and Mr Maduro, for example, even while questioning the wisdom of removing them.Democrats and Republicans are equally incompetent over SoleimaniWhat were the two major foreign policy blunders in our lifetimes? Help me out here. What were they? Vietnam was one, and Iraq was the other, Mr Sanders said Saturday at a town hall in Newton, Iowa. I marched against the war in Vietnam. I was a kid. As a United States congressman in 2002, 2003, I helped lead the effort to prevent us from invading Iraq.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In a statement, Mr Sanders\u0027 national policy director Josh Orton said: Washington\u0027s foreign policy establishment has been consistently wrong, and that a Sanders administration would begin to repair the damage done by Trump.Mr Sanders, 78, was strongly influenced by the Reagan-era US\u0026nbspinterventions in Latin America, which appalled many liberals. Those years also influenced his broader approach to the region, which stands apart from many Democrats. Mr Sanders was at odds with many in the party last year, for example, when he refused to call Mr Maduro a dictator, even as he made critical comments about the authoritarian socialist leader.His comments about Mr\u0026nbspMorales, whose success lifting Bolivians into the middle class made him an iconic figure among socialists, also stood out. At a Univision forum, Mr Sanders praised Mr Morales for addressing poverty and empowering indigenous people. He added that it was fair to question whether he should have stayed in power so long – almost 14 years – but it was a far less critical approach than other Democrats took towards a man whom many viewed as increasingly authoritarian.Mr Sanders has been accused by members of both parties of not being tough enough on repressive socialist regimes. He\u0027s not going to pretend we face remotely equivalent threats from left-wing authoritarianism than from right-wing authoritarianism, said a senior Sanders aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to be candid.When he ran for president four years ago, Mr Sanders often appeared unprepared for a rigorous foreign policy debate. Facing opponent Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state, he often sidestepped questions about specific global challenges.\u0026nbspFollowing his loss, Mr Sanders sought to shore up his foreign policy credentials. After the 2016 election, he hired Matt Duss, who has helped the candidate with his foreign policy chops. Now his top foreign policy hand – and seen inside Mr Sanders\u0027 world as a potential future national security adviser –Mr\u0026nbspDuss rose from blogging about policy to helming the Foundation for Middle East Peace.\u0026nbspIn the years after his loss to Ms Clinton, Mr Sanders delivered some lengthy speeches on foreign policy, including one at Westminster College in Missouri, where Winston Churchill gave his famous Iron Curtain address.\u0026nbspThat 2017 Sanders speech encapsulated much of his thinking on world affairs, people close to him said. In it, he tethered his foreign policy vision to his populist domestic agenda, declaring, We cannot convincingly promote democracy abroad if we do not live it vigorously here at home.Mr Sanders argued that the events of the past two decades have discredited the notion that the US\u0026nbspshould use its military might to shape the world to its liking. He decried US\u0026nbspinterference in Iran and Chile in the 20th century. He underlined the need for alliances to confront adversaries such as North Korea. On a smaller scale, he touted the value of partnering with a sister city in Russia when he was mayor of Burlington, Vermont.\u0026nbspMany Democrats remain unimpressed. On the campaign trail, Mr Sanders has increasingly clashed with Mr Biden, who touts his extensive foreign policy experience in the Senate and Obama administration.David Lammy, the\u0026nbspBritish MP, who has gotten to know Mr Sanders in recent years, noted that Sanders\u0027 views would fit more comfortably in a typical European centre-left party. Whether he were in Germany or France or the UK, of course, Bernie, his politics would be very familiar and probably quite mainstream, Mr\u0026nbspLammy said.He added, Clearly, in the US\u0026nbspcontext, it has been a slightly different experience.While Mr Sanders\u0027 unorthodox views make some Democrats nervous, the most pointed hostility comes from Republicans. Asked what he thinks of Mr Sanders\u0027 foreign policy platform, senator\u0026nbspThom Tillis said, A disaster.\u0026nbspStanding next to him in an elevator in the Capitol Building was senator\u0026nbspRick Scott\u0026nbspwho chuckled and interjected, Does he have a foreign policy?\u0026nbspYet this is a time of foreign policy upheaval in both parties. Mr Trump himself has upended decades of Republican thinking, praising figures such as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un while questioning the role of Nato. A populist non-interventionism is surging in both parties, championed by figures such as representative\u0026nbspTulsi Gabbard and senator Rand Paul.That has given Mr\u0026nbspSanders a sometimes surprising array of foreign policy partners on Capitol Hill. He teamed up with senator Mike Lee, a conservative Republican from Utah, on a measure to end US support for the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen. Their legislation passed the Senate and forced Mr Trump to issue his second veto.\u0026nbspSanders introduces law to stop Trump from starting war with IranOn Saturday, Mr Lee signed onto Mr Sanders\u0027 bill to prevent Mr Trump from deploying funds for military action against Iran without congressional approval.Other alliances have been more controversial. Representatives Ilhan Omar and Rashida\u0026nbspTlaib, who have endorsed Mr Sanders for president, strongly support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement to pressure Israel over its policies towards Palestinians.\u0026nbspMany Democrats and Republicans, including some who have criticised Israeli policies, object to the BDS movement as going too far. To me, BDS has no place, said senator Ben Cardin, formerly the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\u0026nbspMr Sanders himself does not support the BDS movement. But he has been a vocal critic of Mr Netanyahu, and he has said he is willing to make foreign aid to Israel contingent on fostering more peaceful relations with Palestinians, a condition many Democrats and Republicans are unwilling to impose.\u0026nbspWhen it comes to international trade, Mr Sanders opposes an emerging US\u0026nbspdeal with Mexico and Canada, arguing that it does not go far enough in protecting American jobs. The deal has the support of the union AFL-CIO and\u0026nbspElizabeth Warren among others on the left.To some moderate Democrats, including senator\u0026nbspJon Tester of Montana, Mr Sanders\u0027 message at times can resemble the current president\u0027s promises to avoid needless wars. Kind of like Trump? Mr Tester mused in a brief interview at the Capitol. Mr Sanders\u0027 identification as a democratic socialist is something he has to overcome in his pitch to be commander in chief, Mr Tester added.Trade politics also ided Mr Sanders and\u0026nbspBarack Obama. He may have more differences with Obama on foreign policy than Trump, is the great irony, said John Cavanagh, who has known Mr Sanders since 1991 and directs the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal think tank. Both he and Trump can sit down with workers in the Midwest. It\u0027s just that one does it in a racist and xenophobic way.But Mr Sanders has his stark differences with Mr Trump as well. The senator from Vermont was a lonely voice opposing the most recent defence spending bill. And Mr Sanders favours international diplomacy to tackle big issues such as the Paris climate accord.Until recently, Mr Sanders\u0027 proposals have been overshadowed by his sweeping domestic agenda. But the US\u0026nbspkilling of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani prompted Mr Sanders to amplify the linchpin of his foreign agenda: his long-standing opposition to US\u0026nbspintervention abroad.\u0026nbspNews of the airstrike came late 2 January, after Mr Sanders had spent the day campaigning in Iowa. Inside a restaurant at the Doubletree Hotel in Cedar Rapids, Mr Sanders huddled with aides including campaign manager Faiz Shakir and his deputy, Ari Rabin-Havt, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. Mr\u0026nbspDuss, the foreign policy adviser, joined by phone. Together, they crafted a statement calling the killing an assassination and drew a connection to the instability caused by the Iraq War.\u0026nbspIt gives me no pleasure to tell you at this moment we face a similar crossroads fraught with danger, he said the next day during a town hall meeting at the National Motorcycle Museum in Anamosa, Iowa, delivering a speech he wrote and then revised on the drive from the hotel, according to the aide with knowledge of the situation.For some at the town hall, his aversion to military conflict resonated. We\u0027ve been through this in the past, said Thomas Wiand, 51. We went through unnecessary wars continually.Against all odds, it looks like Bernie Sanders might be the nomineeOthers were more cautious. Sometimes you have to go and do what needs to be done to correct the situation, said Craig Bruxvoort, 62, a grain farmer who applauded Mr Trump for ordering general Soleimani\u0027s killing.\u0026nbspThose who have worked with Mr\u0026nbspSanders on foreign policy describe him as methodical and inquisitive. Suzanne DiMaggio, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment who is advising Mr Sanders on Iran, recalled him asking specific questions about the consequences of general Soleimani\u0027s killing.\u0026nbspA lot of the questions focused on the internal political dynamics in Iran: What are the likely scenarios that will now emerge? How will it affect those who are moderates in Iran? Ms DiMaggio said.\u0026nbspBen Rhodes, who served as deputy national security adviser under Mr Obama, remembered briefing Mr Sanders on the Iran nuclear deal for about an hour,\u0026nbspas the senator fired questions his way.A more vivid memory for Mr Rhodes was how Mr Sanders was affected by talking to veterans and family members of soldiers killed in combat.\u0026nbspI remember him telling me once, he said, \u0027Obama doesn\u0027t get enough credit for how many troops Obama took out from Afghanistan,\u0027 said Mr Rhodes, who has offered informal advice to Mr Sanders and other candidates. And Bernie measured that by not having to attend as many funerals in Vermont.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He wants to show voters that the country has moved on and the Government is once more focusing on the domestic issues voters care about.But however much he tries, it will be hard to make these talks boring. They are important and there is already DRAMA BREWING.Boris saw the new Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Downing Street this week. The pair got on well in their hour-long meeting. They both want these talks to be less acrimonious than the orce negotiations both want a more cordial tone.The pair reminisced about the school they had both attended in Brussels. Unlike Eton, it didn’t have playing fields, and until Johnson arrived the only game in the playground was marbles. He introduced some more rough and tumble.No were pleased that von der Leyen, rather than the more confrontational Michel Barnier, took the lead. As one No source points out, the EU loathed the lack of clarity and authority under Theresa May: She wasn’t clear what she wanted and it wasn’t certain that she could deliver what she wanted.With Boris and his new majority it is very dferent. He was able to point von der Leyen to the Tory manesto’s commitments on the future trade deal and say this was his mandate and that he was determined to deliver it.Yet despite the pair’s attempt to maintain a friendly tone, there are already tensions. Boris is irritated that the EU keeps saying it is nigh-on impossible to negotiate a full trade deal by December , despite having signed up to a political declaration that commits it to trying to do just that.The DANGER is that the EU thinks that under time pressure Boris will bend, that he will either extend the transition period — something he has repeatedly promised not to do — or drop his commitment to breaking away from EU rules and regulations.Boris is determined not to do either of these things. He doesn’t want to extend and believes in the value of the UK having the right to do things dferently.Both sides have frequently misunderstood each other in this process. Both sides must now realise that the other means what it says. Unless they do, there is going to be an almighty bust-up and no trade deal at the end of all this.THERE will be a National Security Council meeting later this month to decide whether or not to allow the Chinese company Huawei to be involved in the construction of the UK’s G network.This is an issue of fierce debate in Whitehall. Under Theresa May, it led to the then Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson’s sacking from government.Hawkish figures inside government fear No is leaning towards allowing Huawei’s involvement. One complains that Downing Street’s timetable for the technology’s roll-out is, “not realistic”, but that this time pressure means it will need Huawei involved. However, I understand that the Americans are pushing very hard for the UK to bar Huawei.One senior US government national security figure has been in London this week to lobby directly on this point.Before he makes a decision on Huawei, Boris Johnson should consider the damage it could do to Britain’s most important security relationship – the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing agreement with Australia, Canada, the US and New Zealand.Eventhe UK thinks it can manage Huawei’s involvement,our allies do not then we shouldn’t proceed. It is simply not worth the risk of undermining such a vital alliance.Don’t expect his approach to change. His holidays will be far more glam than Cameron and May’s were.THE most common reason British governments fail is that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor fall out.If No and the Treasury – the most powerful department in government – aren’t on the same page, nothing gets done.Boris Johnson and Sajid Javid are determined to avoid this fate. In the run-up to the Budget on March , there will be a huge effort to make sure that the Treasury and No work together.One Johnson ally tells me the two men will have a Budget-focused meeting at the start of each week to make sure they are in agreement on the key issues.Then their teams will meet again mid-week to assess progress. Javid, whose job is safe in the coming reshuffle, is determined to show that the Treasury is capable of delivering on Boris Johnson’s agenda of levelling up across the country.Those close to him are confident that they can put meat on the bones of No’s plan.AT Cabinet this week it was impressed on ministers that one of the most important events this year is COP, the climate change conference the UK is hosting in Glasgow in November.The UK Government wants to use the event to show how Britain can lead on clean growth post-Brexit.I understand there will be a steady drum beat of announcements on this front throughout the year: The Tories want to show they are helping create new green-collar jobs.They also hope that by holding the event in Scotland, they can emphasise the benefits of the Union.THE Labour leadership contest has yet to catch fire.The Tories are not particularly concerned about any of the candidates.Though there is some hesitation about how they would handle PMQs with Jess Phillips, who likes to make very personal attacks on Boris Johnson.But the most interesting candidate in the race is Lisa Nandy.She seems to have the clearest understanding of why Labour lost.Her bid is starting to have faint echoes of David Cameron’s successful tilt at the Tory leadership in .GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She didn’t meet them.Even the abdication of Edward VIII over Mrs Simpson, together below, was at Government and Church level.To have documents prepared in advance does not surprise me.

They aren’t financially independent now — they get £.- million from the Prince Of Wales and about five per cent from the Sovereign Grant.Harry is reasonably wealthy but not necessarily in cash flow.

And what a waste of their chance to play a key role in helping our Royal Family prosper after the Queen is gone.And what a waste of Harry and Meghan’s unique chance to be a living, inspirational representation of the multiracial country in which we now live. How quickly the shine has come off the golden couple.Less than two years after that wedding day, Harry and Meghan are scurrying off to an ill-defined “progressive” new le in Canada.Butthey have been unhappy with their royal roles, they have brought it on themselves. This much-loved couple have always been too thin-skinned for their own good.They have always been hysterically touchy when justied criticism came their way, such as when they lectured about climate change while reclining on private jets.The criticism was nothing personal. Hollywood stars get called out for climate hypocrisy. Do Harry and Meghan really imagine we will just tug our forelocks as they fly around the world in private jets while talking like Greta Thunberg in a tiara Harry and Meghan are never satisfied with anything less than unconditional deference. They apparently loathe royal le, yet demand to be treated like royalty.They have demonstrated an epic sense of entitlement, such as asking the taxpayer to pick up the £.million builder’s bill for doing up their home, Frogmore Cottage.Their great self-pitying delusion is that the wicked British media has it in for them. But it is not the media that caused Meghan so much excruciating embarrassment.It is largely her own dysal family and their indiscreetly flapping cakeholes, especially her dear old discarded dad Thomas Markle and her loony half-sister Samantha. Harry and Meghan’s self-pity is astounding.“Never complain, never explain,” has been the motto of the modern Royal Family. It has worked rather well.But place Harry and Meghan in front of a sympathetic camera crew, such as when ITV’s Tom Bradby trailed them on their tour of South Africa, and they can’t stop whining. Even when surrounded by victims of rape and landmines, they managed to feel sorry for themselves.“Not many people askedI’m OK,” Meghan complained in the Third World. There has not been a royal couple with such a staggering lack of self-awareness since Marie Antoinette and King Louis XVI of France. And look what happened to them.Harry and Meghan owe their mega-celebrity totally to their connection with the Royal Family. Their superstardom has nothing to do with Meghan’s acting career. Their lives of unimaginable luxury are funded in large part by the British taxpayer.The average couple spends just under £, on their wedding. Harry and Meghan were said to have blown £MILLION. Yet they do not appear to have a grateful bone between them. They seem incapable of counting their multiple blessings.Even now, after handing in their royal resignation, they give every indication that they want all the privileges of royal le with none of the obligations. They want to have their Eton mess and eat it.Harry and Meghan’s security alone currently costs around £, a year, paid for by the politan Police — which means paid for by the British taxpayer. Get the Mounties to start paying for it.And can we finally nail the great lie that Meghan has been persecuted in the UK because of her mixed race  When she first appeared, Meghan was a hurricane of fresh air. The British looked at her and it was love at first sight.This weary, ided, Brexit-battered nation was delighted to have an injection of Hollywood glamour. And millions of Brits now live in mixed-race families. There was real delight to see the Royal Family catching up with the rest of us.Among those crowds at Windsor on their wedding day I saw families of every race and creed under the sun who were ecstatic to see the Royal Family becoming less white, more inclusive, more representative.Harry and Meghan have drawn criticism because of their total lack of self-awareness. Both of them are independently rich. Harry is worth around £million after inheritances from his mother and the Queen Mum.Prince Charles gives him £million every year. Meghan made around £million from her role in long-runningTV legal drama Suits.Yet this fabulously wealthy couple have been happy to let others — the British taxpayer, Prince Charles, the Queen — pay their way in their gilded world.Six weeks, which is theof time that Harry and Meghan have just spent in Canada, is a very long time to be away from home.Unless, of course, “home” doesn’t feel like home because you feel criticised for everything you do and wear, your family – on both sides – are a nightmare and you are constantly judgedby people who have never met you and never will.I should imagine that in this case, Canada seems like a very good place to call home. So, who can blame Meghan and Harry for deciding to leave the UK behind to get away from it all, and maybe staying away from here in the long-term I have a lot of respect for the couple for ploughing their own furrow and walking their own path.Honestly, I couldn’t be happier for Harry, who has experienced so much sadness, that he has met a woman brave enough to suggest doing things a bit dferently.Although they are currently making bold statements about giving up the taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant, they show no sign of being willing to pay for their own security, or their own flunkies, or offer the taxpayer a rebate on those reported £million nuptials.There has never been even the slightest hint of gratitude. There has never been any indication that they — this rich, pampered couple with a beautul baby boy who will never want for anything — realise how lucky they are.So Harry and Meghan are not the only ones with mixed emotions today. There is real resentment that Harry and Meghan have caused distress to our Queen and it will not be easily forgotten or forgiven.The Queen has a -year-old husband who has recently been in hospital. She has a son mired in a squalid sex scandal. And she is  years old. Who the hell do Harry and Meghan think they are This feels like an abdication with a taxpayer-funded safety net. The couple plan to “step back as senior members of the Royal Family” but show no inclination to give up the privileges and pay days that come with the job.They say they want to “work to become financially independent”. But between them they are currently worth around £million. Why not pay their own way NOW Are they really suggesting that they turn their backs on this nation while asking it to foot their bills  It looks like it. The British taxpayer will continue to stump up for their phenomenal security bills. Harry’s daddy will cough up for much .So you can’t help wondering how intelligent they really are, this TV soap actress and a man who left Eton with two A-levels— a school where my dog could get four A-levels.Do Harry and Meghan really think they have had a raw deal  Are they that stupid  There is no republican movement in this country.The Queen has reigned far too well for far too long —  years on the throne next month — for anti-monarchy sentiment to develop.The Queen has spent her entire le placing public duty above private happiness.She has been the stable, stoic centre of this nation for so long that she has single-handedly made losing our monarchy unthinkable.Yet when a spokesman for anti-monarchy pressure group Republic demanded Harry and Meghan make a clean break, I found myself nodding in agreement with every withering word.“Theyhave said that they will dip in and out of royal duties as it suits them but won’t stop taking money until they find other sources of income,” said Republic’s Graham Smith.“To suggest they’re not already financially independent is incredibly crass and belies a sense of entitlement and lack of self-awareness common among royals.”This republican is right. If Harry and Meghan want a new le hanging out with the Clooneys and striking deals with Apple, they should fund it themselves.As they say in North America, do it on your own dime. Give up the HRH titles. Stop leeching off your royal status.They will be a footnote in the story of our Royal Family, Meghan the Wallis Simpson of the st Century, Harry another Duke of Windsor who believed exile with his American orcee would make him happy.The Royal Family is not all about them.The Queen will be an impossible act to follow. But the photograph of Queen Elizabeth smiling proudly with the next three generations of future kings — Princes Charles, William and George — suggests our Royal Family will last for at least  years after Netflix has cancelled The Crown, evenone day Meghan gets to play herself.The succession is assured. Decent men will wear the crown. And Kate is great. But let history record that no royal couple was ever as adored as Harry and Meghan.It is astonishing — and unbelievably sad, perhaps even tragic — that millions of us will be happy to see the back of them.Astrological patterns repeat in families through generations, just as it is doing with Meghan and Harry.Edward VIII, who wed American orcee Wallis Simpson, put love before duty, and planted a karmic seed that is at the root of what is unfolding now. It can be likened to a virus that has been lurking in the Royal household and is now being re-activated by Harry and Meghan.So what comes next  Uranus, the planet of shock-waves, moves to confront the Sun in Aquarius on January  and forms a clash with the New Moon on the th.There is likely to be a stinging backlash as all the remaining senior family members have their roles shaken up.Meghan will create a power couple that flourishes by spring with a number of initiatives. By December , another baby announcement is likely.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We would have done the same to protect British servicemen and women. In fact, as Britain’s Defence Secretary I did exactly that, with the full support of Prime Minister David Cameron.Let’s not forget that every country has the right to self-defence.Of course, nobody wants this crisis to escalate. Indeed Iran’s retaliation has been noticeably limited so far.But the chorus for “de-escalation” carries risks too. Iran has been attacking Western shipping, including capturing a British tanker. Iran has fired missiles at Saudi oil refineries.Iran continues to wage proxy wars in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. Through its militias, Iran continues to destabilise neighbouring Iraq.At some point, somebody had to draw the line. Qasem Soleimani was no hero or statesman. He directed terrorist attacks across the Middle East.Thousands of Syrians, Iraqis and Yemenis died as a result. Iranian dissidents, too, were brutally suppressed.The roadside bomb-making he sponsored killed many of our brave servicemen in Iraq. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson reminded us, he had the blood of our soldiers on his hands.Has Trump’s strike weakened the case for Western intervention  It is worth remembering our troops and those of the US are in Iraq at Iraq’s invitation.Since , we have helped lead an international coalition of more than  countries to support its fragile democracy and liberate that country from the terrorist death-cult of Daesh Isis.And thanks to precision strikes by the RAF and the training by the British Army of thousands of Iraqi troops, Daesh has lost the pernicious grip it once had.Defeating Daesh isn’t just a matter of helping a friend in need or of standing up for human rights. Mercully, we have stopped Yazidi women from being raped, prisoners being burnt alive, gay people being thrown off buildings and Western hostages sadistically executed.But tackling Daesh terrorism is also vital to protect our own way of le here in Western Europe.Islamist fundamentalism needs to be defeated, whether in Mosul, Raqqa, a Paris suburb or on London Bridge.So yes, let’s continue to work with our allies to persuade Iran’s revolutionaries to take a dferent path.Saudi Arabia, the other Gulf countries and even Russia all have roles to play in getting Iran back to the negotiating table.After the appalling shooting down of the Ukrainian airliner, let’s try to show the Iranian people their government needs to be more truthful and more open, that there is a better future beyond the mullahs and the republican guards.But diplomacy alone will not be enough. We have to protect our national interests too. Trump’s strike is a stark reminder that in the end, we must all stand up when those interests are threatened so directly.First, we must persuade other European navies to work with the US and our own Royal Navy in patrolling and protecting convoys through the Strait of Hormuz.This is a vital choke point for Europe’s trade and energy. The gas and oil we need this winter pass through it.It is ludicrous that some Nato allies won’t work with American ships for fear of upsetting the mullahs in Tehran.This has to be a US-led international operation.Second, we need a better nuclear agreement with Iran. It was right to try to halt their nuclear programme. But the previous deal wasn’t comprehensive — it didn’t even cover missiles — and it completely failed to constrain Iranian misbehaviour in the region. If anything, Iran used the access to new finance that deal released to step up its proxy wars in Yemen and where.A new deal should ensure full oversight of all Iran’s nuclear activities by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and only allow Iran back into the international markets when its civil nuclear programme is in complete compliance.Third, we have to step up our campaign against terrorism.Outside the EU after Brexit, we will still need to share intelligence and work together with our European partners to identy new attacks. But our closest ally in the battle to protect our values will always be the US. We may not always agree with Trump’s tactics but we shouldn’t ignore that he has finally cut through the illusion — Iran’s current regime is not our friend.Iran will certainly have learned a lesson from President Trump’s decisive action. But I hope we will do so too.Turning a blind eye to those who foster international terrorism is no longer an option for any of us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She askedthey wanted to join her in the “mile-high club”, then attacked cabin crew who refused her more alcohol.Demi Burton tried to headbutt and kick six crew members and passengers who tried to restrain her before she was arrested when the plane landed.In court, the -year-old claimed she had been drinking because she has a fear of flying and said this behaviour is out of character, which may be true.Her defence lawyer Martin Callery said: “She is thoroughly ashamed of herself . . .  and utterly embarrassed at the way she behaved.”But that is certainly not the impression she conveyed outside court, where she gleefully flicked obscene hand gestures at photographers.No doubt she stopped smiling when she heard she had been sentenced to six months in prison. Personally, I’m not sure how effective prison is. But the problem with reckless behaviour is that you have to face the consequences.And I really hope for Demi, this is the moment she gets her le back on track. We all make mistakes. It’s what we do afterwards that defines us.It would be easy to assume that Demi is a hopeless case. But she is young enough to turn her le around, to work hard, do better and see this rock-bottom moment as a catalyst for change.And then something good will come from what is a very low moment in her le. We don’t have to look far for examples of people who have overcome lapses or mistakes before going on to succeed.Take Robert Downey Jr, who went from drug addict to one of Hollywood’s highest-paid actors. Or Elton John and Robbie Williams, both of whom have overcome major drug issues before enjoying renewed stardom, fatherhood and, more importantly, a good le.While it is not the same as a drunken mistake, anyone who has made it in business will have a good few failures under their belt — whether it is a dodgy commercial decision, plain bad luck or a company that has gone bust.It is not what happens to us in le but what we do next that counts. So I am guessing that, from her cell, Demi might be reflecting on what she might do dferently when she gets out. Andshe isn’t, she should be.Because it is the getting back on the horse that counts, evenit means resisting the urge to go back to bed to hide. No one is perfect. No one gets through le without messing up or things going wrong.Before success, you will get temporary defeat or total failure. The key to getting through it is resilience. And one of the best gts you can give a child is to encourage them not to give up.By the way, I speak here from experience. Like any businesswoman, I’ve made some mistakes and had my fair share of knocks.There are some that I have managed to turn to my advantage and others that I have had to chalk up to experience.The key thing is that I have learned from what went wrong, then moved on. That experience has allowed me to create a mini-manesto on how to fail how to respond to setbacks and failure, which I’ll share here now:Give yourself time to recover and reflect. Force yourself to take small steps to get back on the horse. Do not accept failure. See it as a step on the journey towards success.Remember that challenging and dficult moments are what help you grow bigger or better. Without them, you would stay the same.The only people who haven’t experienced setbacks are people who are too scared to try. So “failure” is often a sign of bravery. Hold your head up high at all times.Try your best and be proud to do so, eventhings don’t always work out the way you want them to. Remind yourself: “Where there is a will, there’s a way.” And as they say, the best thing about the future is it comes one day at a time.ANOTHER new year, another month of looking at photos of scantily clad people on beaches in sunnier climes and asking myselfI am the only person who is not on the beach.This is the time of year for massive bikini-body and holiday FOMO.But let us all take heart that it is also, oh joy, the time of year for elasticated waists hidden under chunky knitwear.Personally, I am more than happy to swap the beach for nothing to shave and no stomach to suck in. Bliss.I’M sure parents everywhere were shocked to read the story of the son who bullied his mother and stepfather so viciously he has been jailed for three years for his controlling and coercive behaviour.When Nicholas Hazell, , of County Durham, went back to live with Judith Ridley, , and her reverend husband Stephen, , after losing his job, he made their lives hell.Hazell, above, created a “horrendous atmosphere” at the family home and flew into a petulant ragehe didn’t get his own way, Durham Crown Court heard.Among his worst outbursts were when Hazell threw his mother into a chair and spat at her while holding a screwdriver to his stepfather’s throat. He also told them: “I am a master of bullying.”It sounds horric.I feel so sorry for his mum, who must be devastated that her little boy turned into a cruel bully as an adult.I dont do needles when it comes to my face.  Lasers, facials, peels . . .  sure. But needles are another story entirely.If you are willing to take the chance of injecting poison into your face, at the very least you want a predictable result. And in my experience, you don’t get it.Who wants eyebrows at the top of their head, lips that come into the room before you do, or a forehead that doesn’t move  Not me, that’s for sure. However . . .This week I read that not only is the gorgeous Abbey Clancy having micro-Botox injections, hyaluronic acid fillers and vitamins, she is doing it with TWENTY needles at once.Abbey, , is having something called an aquagold facial, so called because each needle is covered in -carat gold. The marketing blurb claims this treatment will reduce pores, blur out fine lines and leave your skin with a vibrant glow.Some might say this is a slippery slope to the stronger stuff but Abbey looks amazing.  So it has to be worth a try, don’t you think I HAD to laugh at the photos of the BBC newsreader whose dress, which had burst open minutes before going on air, was cobbled together from behind by quick-thinking colleagues.  Liz Beacon’s outfit was patched up with gaffer tape and bulldog clips.I used to believe what I saw on TV. But since filming The Apprentice, I know all too well that all is not necessarily what it seems.Two examples spring to mind. First, the countless times I have been filmed in the boardroom with a smart jacket on top and leggings or even pyjama bottoms and slippers under the boardroom table.Second, and worse, the time I somehow forgot to bring a bra on a day I was wearing a white blouse.Luckily, a kind crew member who is roughly the same size as me lent me hers.  And the show, as it always seems to do, went on.I WAS appalled to read about the private Islamic secondary school that has been “unlawfully segregating” boys and girls for all activities except weekly assemblies, according to a stinging Ofsted report.One of the teachers theretold pupils “university is not for females”, according to the report. Which begs the question of where, then, is the best place for females  The kitchen Inspectors who visited Birmingham’s Redstone Educational Academy in November last year also found male students were given privileges and treated more favourably than their female counterparts when it came to sports, school trips and work experience.That was something disputed by the headteacher.That’s not good enough. There can be no place for a school like this and it should be closed down.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A recent Postmedia poll in Canada found that over % there were in favour of Prince Harry becoming the Governor General of Canada.The poll also showed that it was younger Canadians who would be most in favour of such a move, and that even in the generally French republican province of Quebec, almost half would also support this.The current Governor General, Julie Payette, who has been in post since , has done a sterling job. However, neither she, nor anyone  who has previously held this position, possess the same kind of box office appeal that Harry does.While their methods and approach to royal duties may not always fall in line with tradition, there is no doubting that Harry and Meghan are seen by many of the younger generation as symbols of a new, modern, vibrant monarchy.Installing Harry as Governor General would not only bolster support for the Monarchy internationally, but also provide Canada, and by extension the United Kingdom, an enormous boost in soft power at an important juncture for our country as we depart the European Union.Procedurally, there would be few barriers to making this a reality. The Governor General is appointed to the role on the advice of Canadian Prime Minister, and while the convention is for the Governor General to serve for around five years, there are no specic constitutional requirements for this.Thus,this is something Harry himself wished to do, a call from Her Majesty to Justin Trudeau would go a long way in pushing this along.I have the honour to remain, Madam, Your Majesty’s most humble and obedient servant.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Perhaps this explains why his Wikipedia entry has just been doctored to delete his status as a “millionaire”. Not me, guv, protests Starmer.He is also weirdly reluctant to declare where he stands on the political spectrum. Is he a Corbynite or a Blairite or a bit of both  “I don’t have the names of former leaders tattooed on my head,” snfs the man named at birth after the first leader of the Labour Party.This knight of the realm, who played violin at fee-paying Reigate Grammar School alongside Fatboy Slim, claims a humble background as the son of a toolmaker.“I know what it’s like,” he insists, asraised in a cardboard box.Well, I went to the same school when it was a “bog-standard” state grammar. My father was a journeyman upholsterer. It didn’t give me any special insights.Starmer boasts in his new campaign video about picket-line stints alongside down- trodden Wapping printworkers — against my boss, Rupert Murdoch, a hate figure on the Left.This chameleon politician was dubbed a “Sir” on the recommendation of Gordon Brown, a title he discourteously declines to use because it invites contempt among those with a vote.His citation was for “services to law and criminal justice”, after a five-year term as DPP.At about the same time he was parachuted into Parliament as MP for rock-solid Labour Holborn and St Pancras, in London.It is here that self-respecting Labour voters should pause and reflect.Many believe these political plums were reward for the longest, costliest and perhaps most spiteful criminal persecution in history — ordered by Sir Keir Starmer.His new leadership video slyly refers to this time, apparently to boost his scourge-of-capitalism image among the “comrades” — even though politics should play no part in a DPP’s decision-making. In a travesty of justice, he rammed two dozen innocent journalists through Old Bailey trials on trumped-up conspiracy charges — a medieval catch-all which even the Crown Prosecution Service admitted was “an extremely dficult and rarely visited area of the law”.The prosecuting counsel was given a flea in his ear for “chopping and changing”, the charges against the journalists.The trials ended with acquittals all round, an admission that “no crime may have been committed” and this rebuke from the Lord Chief Justice:“What concerns me is the freedom of the Press and the desire of officials to contain information.“We must ensure the Press is protected — we can’t use criminal sanctions to undermine their position.”The defendants were all journalists on The Sun or the News of the World — then seen by the Left as fair game.The trials followed The Sun’s decision to switch its support from Gordon Brown’s floundering regime to David Cameron’s Tories.Some believe the two were linked — but surely that’s just a conspiracy theory.What is absolutely clear to those who care about the issue is Starmer’s readiness to use his power to curb Press freedom.As citizens of totalitarian regimes rapidly learn to their cost, without a free Press there is no such thing as free speech.IT’S win-win for the Sussexes and losses all round for the House of Windsor.Meghan’s first kiss-and-tell will be a bestseller, with all the gossip on Randy Andy and those secret royal scandals.Harry’s right-on charities will be milked for millions.Once our revered Queen has departed, the monarchy will dwindle to a sideshow on the US celebrity circuit.Charles is too old to compete and William is too dull, despite Kate’s best efforts.Hero Harry will emerge as victor in this grotesque civil war.

This would be morally indefensible and politically mad.Yes, a working government in Northern Ireland would be a good thing. But the safety and wellbeing of our elderly veterans is too big a price tag.And given Boris won the election by being a proud patriot, it makes political sense for him to stand by the armed forces through thick and thin.If the PM is to hold the hard-earned trust of new Conservative voters, he must never give way to those who would put our old soldiers in the dock.IT would be fair to assume that anyone injecting plastic into someone’s face should have some qualications to do so.But a strange loophole in the law means that though Botox is classied as a medicine in Britain, dermal fillers aren’t covered by any regulation.A staggering  per cent of facial fillers are performed by people with no medical training, often in unsanitary conditions — with devastating results.Which is why The Sun’s Fabulous brand is launching the Had Our Fill campaign, urging for a crackdown on unregulated cosmetic fillers, and raising awareness to help women make safer, more informed choices.We’ve had our fill of dodgy fillers.

So we can compete. But when the field is tilted and people start making up the rules … thataposs when the problems start. Last week, as Samira Ahmed won her equal pay claim against the BBC, we saw just how the game is rigged. Ahmed, who hosts the viewer feedback programme, Newswatch, was paid seven times less than Jeremy Vine, who presents a similar programme, Points of View. Seven Times! The BBC justied this discrepancy by claiming that the Points of View needed a “cheeky” presenter with a “glint in his eye”. That’s some glint! The BBC clearly knew what they meant. They paid enough for it, I on the other hand wasn’t so sure. But when subjected to the critical eye of an impartial jury the rationale clearly fell apart. “Jeremy Vine read the script from the autocue,” their devastating assessment read. “He read it in the tone in which it was written. If it told him to roll his eyes, he did. It did not require any particular skill or experience to do that….We have dficulty in understanding what [the BBC] meant by a ‘glint in the eye’ and how that translated into a ‘skill’ or ‘experience’ for the job.  How does one acquire such a skill or experience ” The point here is not to do down Jeremy Vine. I like him and his competence was not on trial.  His pay is not going down. It is to try and decipher why a woman would be paid so much less for essentially the same work. How could Ahmed’s talents be so undervalued  How could her talents be so invisible  What were they thinking  How could this happen  As the shadow minister for equalities I know nobody in the BBC was sitting there thinking - “How can we pay a woman less than a white man for the same job ” This was not a deliberate ploy. Discrimination, nowadays, rarely works like that. True, there are people who think little of women and denigrate people of colour. One of them lives at Number . Imagine how the media would have treated meI had been caught having three affairs, one love child,  refused to tell anyone how many children I had and talked about white people the way Boris Johnson has talked about black people and Muslims. But beyond that gilded world, where a pliant media look past the prejudice of the privileged, many of us work in institutions that simply haven’t caught up with how the way the world has changed. They are driven by the same impulses and reflexes as they were when women were supposed to stop working once they had kids and black people were rarely seen and never heard. Ahmed was effectively caught in a system that devalues women and people of colour, failing to see their potential and to understand their contributions as valid.  We are judged by dferent standards. The verdict could leave the BBC with a bill running into the millions as similar claims by other female staff now come to the fore. But the cost to their reputation. This is the nation’s broadcaster. People expect more from the BBC. Ahmed certainly did. The bravery and tenacity it took for her to pursue this course of action cannot be underestimated. “I love working for the BBC,” she said.  “No woman wants to have to take action against their own employer.” Tomorrow I hope to make it onto the ballot for the Labour Party Deputy Leadership.  tle I’m certainly qualied. I’m the first elected black woman in Britain to ever become a minister I’ve had responsibilities under two Labour prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and I have served in Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet.  In  I won my seat from the Lib Dems with a .% swing - the biggest swing to Labour in the country. You would think that would be enough to get me on the ballot and then let Labour members decide whether I’m up to the job. My potential opponent does. Angela Rayner has generously called for some of those who nominated her to switch their vote to me so that we can have a full debate about the future of the party, just as I nominated Jeremy Corbyn, even though I initially supported Andy Burnham, because I thought it was important that his voice was heard. The field of Labour candidates standing for the leadership and deputy leadership, has never been more erse. It remains to be seen whether the candidates that the Parliamentary Labour Partyselect to put before the membership will reflect that.

Abena Oppong-Asare and Florence Eshalomi both won their seats in December and have spoken out about attitudes in Parliament. Oppong-Asare, who is MP for Erith and Thamesmead, says she was also handed a bag by a Tory MP to look after because he thought she was someone .  She was also confused with other black women in the Commons. In a Twitter thread she explained: The other day I was outside the @HouseofCommons chamber talking to @DrRosena [Rosena Allin-Khan] and one of the Tory MPs walked straight to me to put his bag in my hands asking me to look after it #ThisIsWhyRepresentationMattersShe said: In my first week someone came up to me confusing me with another black MP.

She tweeted: Girl I also got confused for another black sista MP as we were coming out of the voting lobby...... but I have to admit it was by a fellow Labour MP. Guess we all need to wear massive name tags right.  Their tweets prompted an outpouring of support. Leadership candidate Jess Phillips remarked: Abena you are already making your mark in Parliament as a brilliant force. This experience speaks to so much that is wrong with our parliament and our institutions. You should find the Tory who did it next week and ask them to hold your bag and throw your coat in too! But Rayner faced a backlash for her response to Florence Eshalomi. She commented: “Me and Jess Phillips often have the same problem because we both have an accent despite them being totally dferent.” Some users accused her of comparing their experiences with her experience of being mistaken for other MPs with a strong regional accent. She later deleted the message, saying her remark y had been poorly judged, adding: “As I would in no way compare that to my colleagues who are mistaken due to the colour of their skin.”  It comes as both Clive Lewis and Dawn Butler, who do not yet have the numbers they need to get on the leadership and deputy leadership ballots, have suggested that the Parliamentary Labour Party has an issue with racism. Butler, who has been an MP since  has previously spoken of being mistaken for a cleaner in parliament.

Sir Desmond Swayne said families on benefits who are forced to turn to foodbanks should learn to do food shopping “more cost effectively”. Writing in a local newspaper he argued foodbanks are an “important contribution” to the welfare system. But checks should be made to see how families “actually spend” their benefits, the MP for New Forest West, in Hampshire added. The former aide to ex-PM David Cameron said: “The shocking statistic is one in five of our children is obese by the time they leave primary school and this disproportionately affects those children in the lowest household incomes. To put it bluntly : the poorest are amongst the fattest. “The conclusion I draw is their families need, in addition to welfare payments, help with how to shop more cost effectively and healthily.” "},{"url":null,"title":"boy excluded school age five","story":"NewsBoy is banned from school at age five because of his violent behaviourRudi Barnes was permanently excluded from St Malachys RC Primary in Miles Platting, Manchester, after he kicked and punched teaching staff, tipped over chairs and a table, and pulled displays off a wallShareBySteve Robson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video how-appeal-schools-admission-decision-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news boy-excluded-school-age-five-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

Last September, just two days into the new school year , Rudi Barnes was permanently excluded from St Malachyaposs RC Primary in Miles Platting, Manchester. Headteacher Mrs Janine Parker took the decision after an incident in which he kicked and punched teaching staff, tipped over chairs and a table, and pulled displays off a wall. It was the culmination of a pattern of violent behaviour that began in nursery when he was just three. He hasnapost had another day in school since his exclusion, the Manchester Evening News reports. The week before Christmas, little Rudi was writing out cards for all his classmates. His parents Claire Scae and Carl Barnes had to take them in to school for him, but they fear Rudi is already being left behind. He went to a friendaposs birthday party and this kid said aposnobody remembers you in school apos, said Claire, . He got really upset, itaposs heartbreaking. While the parents understand why the school made the drastic decision, they are distraught and believe more should have been done to keep him in school and get him the help he clearly needs. The couple say they have no idea where Rudiaposs behaviour comes from and that it doesnapost happen at home.  Certainly, Rudiaposs exclusion is unusual. There were just  children permanently excluded aged five across the country in -, according to the Department for Education. In Manchester, only thirteen pupils in total were permanently excluded from state-funded primary schools. The advice to headteachers is that it should be an absolute last resort. However,  as the M.E.N has reported previously  , soaring rates of exclusions has been a serious problem in Manchester schools in recent years. A government review, led by former childrenaposs minister Edward Timpson and published last year, pointed to an array of negative outcomes for children who are excluded including a reduced likelihood of achieving good GCSEs, a higher chance of ending up unemployed and a higher chance of being either the victim, or perpetrator of a crime. In November , Manchester Council responded by launching a new aposInclusion Strategyapos that was designed to tackle exclusion rates. But the sad story of how Rudi Barnes came to be kicked out of school at such a young age, and his parentsapos ongoing battle to make sure he gets an education, highlights how this continues to be a challenging problem.Many of those tasked with preventing exclusions, from school staff to mental health services, are struggling with a rapidly increasing workload and dwindling budgets after a decade of government funding cuts. Four months after his permanent exclusion, Rudi still hasnapost had another day at school or been assessed by a mental health professional, despite being referred to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Servicesat least nine times, the M.E.N understands. By law, the local authority must make arrangements for a childaposs full time education from the sixth day of exclusion onwards. Rudi has been offered alternative provision at Bridgelea, a Pupil Referral Unit , for permanently excluded children but it has left the parents in a quandry. There used to be a Bridgelea site in Gorton, near to their home in Miles Platting, but that closed in . The main PRU site is in Withington, almost six miles away and several bus journeys away for Claire and Carl who do not have a car and are reliant on state benefits. Carl, , is a full-time carer to partner Claire who has diabetes, and is also responsible for getting Rudiaposs nine-year-old brother and two-year-old sister to school every day. The family borrowed a car to take Rudi for a day visit to Bridgelea and after meeting the headteacher, they believe the school can provide the support he needs. But the couple feel it is simply aposimpossibleapos for Carl to get the other children to school and also take Rudi to Bridgelea.  Carl and Claire were hoping Rudi could get funding from the council for transport from home to school but so far none has materialised. Manchester Council says Rudi has been provided with a bus pass for free travel and ultimately, there is no excuse for him not to be at Bridgelea. The authority has now threatened to prosecute Carl and Claire for failing to send their child to school, although it has agreed to pause proceedings after the M.E.N requested a comment about the case. If convicted, the couple face a fine or even a prison sentence. They said they will take me to court, said Carl. Fine,thataposs what it takes to explain it all, we will go to court. It seems extreme that Rudiaposs future should now be decided in a criminal court room. Carl and Claire struggle to understand how it got to this point. Speaking at the familyaposs neatly-kept home last week, the couple showed the M.E.N a pile of paper documents relating to Rudiaposs problems at school. It has already been a long and intimidating process. Rudiaposs violent behaviour began just months after he first started in nursery at St Malachyaposs in September . As might be expected of such a young child, many of the incidents were petulant in nature. They offered him a pear, and he doesnapost like pears, said Carl. So he threw it at the teacher and cut her lip. He was excluded from reception for that. Staff tried to handle Rudiaposs outbursts by taking him out of the room, but by reception, his behaviour was escalating. They said he was just getting more angry, said Carl They did get a psychologist in, a behaviour specialist. But they only came one day and didnapost see anything. The teacher told us theyaposre trained in holding techniques but they donapost like using it. If theyaposd have held him until he calmed down, then he gives hugs and kisses out to the teachers. If theyaposd held him, he wouldnapost have got excluded, or he would have got the help earlier on.  In response to Claire and Carlaposs claims, a spokesperson for the Diocese of Salford, the organisation that runs St Malchyaposs said: It would not be appropriate to comment on the inidual circumstances of any one pupil . At St Malachyaposs all decisions are taken in the best interest of our school community. However, it is understood the schoolaposs position is that only aposselectedapos, more senior staff are trained in holding techniques and that other de-escalation techniques were used with Rudi following advice from an external behaviour consultant. Often, Rudi doesnapost appear to even remember what has happened after a violent episode at school and will be hugging the same teachers he was hitting only minutes earlier. Claire and Carl describe their son as a aposlovingapos little boy who likes giving out hugs so much he even embraces the staff at his local ASDA.  Rudi has both younger and older siblings and doesnapost seem to suffer the same rage blackouts with them or his parents.  I said to one of the teachers aposis it really that bad apos said Claire.   So she showed me a video of it on the iPad and I couldnapost believe it. I thought aposis that really Rudi apos thataposs not my son. He was in a rage, his face looked dferent and everything I thought aposoh my godapos. I was heartbroken.   Itaposs like he sees red and doesnapost know what heaposs doing, but I donapost know what triggers it off.   This is what we want to find out - weaposve been begging for help. Over the past eighteen months, Rudiaposs parents, his GP and staff at St Malachyaposs have all referred him to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Serviceson several occasions. But CAMHS repeatedly refused to see Rudi on the basis he did not aposfit the criteriaapos. Carl and Claire say they were told in person they would have to wait until he was six before he would be seen. That appears to be true as CAMHS offered an appointment three days after Rudi turned six in December. But while they are happy to finally see a step forward, Carl and Claire fear it will still be a y process before Rudi gets the help he needs. And they believeRudi had been seen earlier, he might not have ended up being permanently excluded in the first place.  Heaposs heartbroken he canapost go to school, but itaposs just aposhard luck, nobodyaposs going to even look at you yetapos, said Claire. We shouldnapost be in this predicament, it should all be in place before the child is permanently excluded. He should have been sent to the PRU while he was at school. Weaposve looked into finding him another one nearer us but there isnapost one. I went in [to CAMHS] crying saying aposplease help me, what have I got to do apos, they said heaposs got to be six. Meanwhile, with Rudi now having been out of school for more than four months, the effects are starting to show. His preference is to be at St Malachyaposs and his absence is made all the more painful as he often accompanies his dad when dropping off and picking up his older brother. Mum Claire says Rudi now often refuses to eat or hides food around the house at meal times. The teacher hugged him the other day and said aposRudi youaposve lost weightapos, said Claire. Itaposs shocking. At dinner, he was crying, aposIaposm not eating it, Iaposm not eating itapos. He goes to pick his brother up and heaposs crying saying aposwhy canapost I go to school apos Heaposs only a baby - he doesnapost know whataposs happened. He says aposIaposm missing my friendsapos. Heaposs missing out on a lot. Claire and Carl are aware that some people might write them off as bad parents because of Rudiaposs predicament. But they say they couldnapost be trying any harder to do whataposs best for him and get him back in school. We just feel like weaposre hitting our heads off a wall, said Claire. The doctor said, aposyouaposve hit a brick wall, thereaposs no help out there for that age groupapos.  Imagine we were those parents who donapost caretheir kids go to school  Our kids donapost get a day off. We make sure they get up in the morning, theyaposre not even late.  It seems like itaposs all down to money though, nobody wants to help you, you get told aposphone this person, phone that personapos, weaposve phoned that many people weaposre going round in circles. Manchester Council funds aposhome to schoolapos transport services via the Travel Co-Ordination Unit. It is a complicated process that usually involves a child already having a statement of Special Educational Needsor Education, Health and Careplan. Rudi has neither because he has yet to be assessed by a professional. But evenhe does get an SEN statement, his parents may struggle to get travel support getting him to school. In its - budget, the council said there are aposexisting budget pressuresapos totalling £.million aposrelating to Special Education Needs and Disabilityhome to school transport, leaving care accommodation and adoption allowances. As a result, the council intends to save £, from its Travel Co-Ordination budget between -. However, the M.E.N understands efforts are now being made to try and resolve the situation with Rudiaposs travel arrangements. He is also due to have his first appointment with the CAMHS service in the next few days. But Claire and Carl still have a long way to go with getting Rudi back in full-time education and receiving the help he needs. There must be other kids going through this, said Carl. I think it should be highlighted that no matter what age you are,you need help, you need help. Not just my kids, all the other kids out there. In  , there were  permanent exclusions from Manchester schools, a decrease of  compared with the year before. This included  in secondary school and  in primary. But the details of Rudiaposs case suggests there is still work to do.

Billie Hodgson, , suffers from cataplexy meaning that any strong emotion, especially laughter, will cause her to pass out. Her condition means Billie, who is currently studying at sixth form, has to steer clear of certain joker friends to avoid collapsing when she sees them. The student from Sheffield, said: “I’m a bubbly person so to go from that to feeling like I can’t laugh is really strange. I feel like I can’t be me. “My friends try not to be funny andthey make me laugh they feel like they have to apologise. When Iaposm with them, I tend not to be as involved in funny situations to avoid cataplexy and especially in front of those who are not as familiar with it. “We joke about it like friends do because t’s a funny thing in itself, and I have to make light of it. If we’re eating and everyone is laughing around the table, everyone tries to stop but then the silence makes you laugh. It’s so hard to explain how it feels when I collapse, itaposs like you have no control over your body - I don’t have any control over what’s happening. I can’t speak or respond to anything - but the most frustrating thing is that I’m conscious.  I shake, and I can’t hold things. General excitement triggers it, and since I was diagnosed the triggers have become more sensitive. Billie, who lives at home with -year-old mum Sharon, and sister, Harley, , was only diagnosed with cataplexy in March this year despite finding herself on the floor every time she laughed throughout her school years. She says her first memory of cataplexy is collapsing in the dinner hall at secondary school when she was around . There is no cure for cataplexy and the conditionaposs only available treatment involves taking daily medication to try and control it.  Billie said: I remember once walking through school with a friend and we were laughing, then I just fell to my knees. Everyone thought I’d tripped but I knew something wasn’t right. At first we didn’t think it was that serious and the doctor told me everyone shakes when they laugh. But when I was diagnosed, I felt mixed emotions. I was relieved that I finally knew what it was and could then start treatment, but at the same time scared because I didnapost know how much it would affect my le.  Itaposs also a lelong illness which meant it was quite a big thing to accept. As well as forcing her to avoid social situations, Billie’s dreams of becoming a midwe have been thwarted by the rare illness. She now wants to speak out to bust myths around the unusual disorder.

A £ ticket includes stamp duty and legal fees, with the couple, who have lived at the property  years, hoping to sell , to meet the valuation and cover other fees. They were inspired by another home owner who sold over £ million-worth of tickets for his £,-valued property. Michael said with he and Linda deciding to go their separate ways, they put the cottage on the market last year but failed to find a buyer probably because of the housing market and Brexit. The cottage, just an houraposs drive from Birmingham, also includes The Granary - a self-contained annex, and is estimated to have doubled in value in  years. If , tickets arenapost sold, the lucky winner can instead take away  per cent of the receipts, butthe raffle rakes in more than expected the Chathaaposs will make a big donation to Hope House. The charity supports children with le-limiting illnesses and their families. Michael, originally from Sutton Coldfield and dad to Charlie, , and Jack, , said it was a privilege to have lived in their dream country cottage since .  The idyllic property boasts exposed beams throughout every room and a farmhouse style kitchen with an oil-fired AGA and walk-in pantry. It backs onto a th century church and Longnor Hall, with its medieval deer park, which means it is very secluded with almost no neighbours. While a primary school, rated aposOutstandingapos by Ofsted, is within walking distance. Shrewsbury town is a quarter of an hour up the road, and Church Stretton and Ludlow are close, while the Welsh coast is just  minutes down the road. I was born and bred in Sutton Coldfield and when we had Charlie we used to come out here to go to a country pub and said it would be wonderful to find a place to live here, said Michael, who works in marketing for a software company.  It was more than we could afford but we said you only live once so we stretched ourselves and itaposs been a wonderful home and a great investment. Our children went to the Ofsted-rated Outstanding school up the road and the local community is great. Ludlow, with all its lovely restaurants, is only  minutes away, you can be in Birmingham and Chester within an hour, and within  minutes you can be dipping your feet in the water in Aberdovey in Wales. He added: We know lots of people from Sutton Coldfield and Birmingham would love the idea of living in a country home but the winner could do what they like with it, whether thataposs to rent it out, start an Air BnB or sell it themselves. Itaposs already started to go viral, with lots of people tweeting about it in America. Weaposve had calls from the James Corden and Ellen shows, and GMTV too. The tickets have been selling like crazy in the last couple of hours.

Harry, , will join the Queen, , Prince Charles, , and Prince William, , for crunch talks about his future in a matter of hours at Sandringham. Meghan, , who reportedly flew to Canada a few days ago, is said to hope to take part in the meeting via a conference call. And it is claimed the former actress will use the popular phone messaging app to exchange strategies with her husband.A royal source claimed to The Sun: “They want to be able to chat one-to-one as the main players delve into the nitty-gritty of their breakaway.”The extraordinary negotiations come after the couple announced they would be aposstepping backapos as senior royals and plan to become financially independant. Kensington Palace did not wish to comment. Meanwhile, the Queen is to chair todayaposs crisis talks as she joins her family to thrash out a plan for Harry and Meghan. The historic meeting at her private estate will be the first time Harry has met with his grandmother, the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge since the issue engulfed the royal family this week, making headlines around the world. The couple triggered a aposroyal crisisapos by announcing last week they would be stepping back from their duties and spending more time in North America.  It is claimed the couple consulted neither the Queen nor Charles on the announcement, made on Instagram and their own website, a step seen as impertinent and premature. Harry and Meghan said they wanted to carve out a progressive new role for themselves and work to become financially independent. But it was unclear how the couple will become what royal biographers said was akin to being a half royal - and who will pay for their transatlantic lestyles. Meghan has ed to Canada to be with their son Archie after the couple spent six weeks in the country in late .  The duchess flew to Canada a few days ago where the family spent an extended festive break in the province of British Columbia. It is thought William will be travelling to the estate in Norfolk from his Kensington Palace apartment and Harry from Frogmore Cottage near Windsor Castle. Charles was in Oman to attend a condolence ceremony following the death of Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said, and was due to travel back to the UK on Sunday evening. The Queen attended church at Sandringham on Sunday where wellwishers expressed sympathy for her, and clapped as she left, with some members of the public saying that Harry and Meghan should not receive any more taxpayersapos money.  The monarch was pictured arriving for the service wearing a hearing aid for what is believed to be the first time in public. Harry and Meghan are said to have left the Queen feeling hurt by their bombshell announcement that they plan to step back as senior royals, become financially independent and split their time between the UK and North America. There are a range of issues to be discussed today, and it is likely the royals will try to come to some agreement before the meeting ends to stop the immediate crisis causing lasting damage to the monarchy. Harry and Meghanaposs statement - and a new official Sussexroyal website - have thrown up important questions about funding for the coupleaposs round-the-clock security, media access to their royal events and how they will pay for their future lestyles.  Other important issues to resolve include who will pay for the substantial security cost of protecting the couple and their baby sonthey spend large portions of the year in Canada and possibly America. It is not known what time the family plan to meet, how long the summit is expected to last or whether the entire day has been set aside to find a solution. Before the meeting, the royals will be given written proposals produced by their offices and others, including relevant government departments from the UK and Canada, where it is thought Harry and Meghan will establish a second home.

The Duchess of Sussex ed to the £ million waterside Vancouver Island mansion where she spent Christmas with Prince Harry but managed to avoid TV crews when she flew in using the low-cost WestJet airline. The media, who assumed she would be on a private jet, missed her arrival, Mail Online has reported. Over Christmas, local residents were asked by royal protection offers to hold back from revealing their location for at least a couple of weeks to allow the royal couple some time to themselves.  The couple reportedly went hiking and jogging, and even did some Christmas shopping in the nearby town. Chris Stephen, owner of Lilaberry Home Decor in the nearby town of Sidney-by-the-Sea, said Harry came into her store just before Christmas with a protection officer to buy festive table decorations - but in her shock, she mistakenly called him aposPrince Andrewapos. Chris said Harry had a blue woollen hat over his eyes and mumbled in a fake Canadian accent into the collar of his coat. I thought there was something familiar about him, even though I could barely see his face, she said. And then I said, aposOh my God, youaposre Prince Andrew!apos. One of her colleagues corrected her, and Chris said she nearly fainted and must have shrieked. She said she wanted to give him a motherly hug but was asked by the officer to be discreet. We went and had a chat in the storeroom and the first thing Harry said to me - looking horried - was: aposI canapost believe you thought I was Prince Andrew! I told him that I was so overwhelmed I forgot his name. He said he tried to disguise his voice by speaking with a Canadian accent and I told him he made a terrible job of it.  In the end I did give him a hug – a big mum hug – and he was very gracious and patient with me, a real well-mannered guy. It is not known how long Meghan is intending to stay in Canada. Harry is not expected to leave the UK until at least next weekend while he deals with the aftermath of the coupleaposs shock announcement that they would step back from their roles as senior royals. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have said they plan to become financially independent and split their time between the UK and North America. Harry is due to attend a crisis meeting on Monday with the Queen, Prince Charles and Prince William on Monday.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailSenior members of the royal family are preparing for a crunch summit at Sandringham today to decide Prince Harry and Meghan Markleaposs future in the firm.   The Queen wants to get issues surrounding their future resolved quickly and gave senior aides just days to come up with a plan. Those attending the meeting, which is expected to take place this morning, include the Queen, Prince Charles, William and Harry. Meghan is also likely to be dialling in from Canada at am local time. Key issues for the future of Meghan and Harryaposs relationship with the Royal Family will be discussed after last weekaposs sensational announcement that they intend to aposstep backapos as senior royals. It is possible that nothing will be resolved today and there are reports that the so-called aposabdicationapos of the young royal couple could take months. All three of William, Charles and the Queen are expected to warn that there are signicant obstacles to be overcome before Harry and Meghan can make their move. Important questions thrown up by Harry and Meghanaposs new website are likely to be central to discussions. Funding for the coupleaposs round-the-clock security, media access to their royal events and how they will pay for their future lestyles will be very important. A vital issue to resolve includes who will pay for the substantial security cost of protecting the couple and their baby sonthey spend large portions of the year in Canada and possibly the US. At the meeting, it is understood Harry will be presented with documents put together following talks with the tax authorities in the UK and Canada, after the couple said they wish to be aposfinancially independentapos and seek to make their own money away from royal le. The Duke and Duchess potentially face a aposdouble taxapos on commercial income and bills running into the millions from numerous authorities, reports the Mail Online .  And with Canada requiring residents and certain property owners to pay income tax on global earnings, in a similar way to the UK, Harry could be forced to give up his UK residency or limit his time in Canada. Harry and Meghan have said the Sovereign Grant makes up just five per cent of their income and is only used for official office expenses and that they intend to give it up as they aim to become financially independent. But with hundreds of thousands still likely to be spent from public money each year for official travel abroad, this will likely be a key issue at the meeting. The Sussexesapos website states that  per cent of their annual funding comes from the Duchy of Cornwall, the Prince of Wales’s private estate, estimated at around £.million. It is likely to be discussed whether Charles is willing to continue to allow this. It has been reported they may be keen to make promotional deals abroad to allow for financial independence, but these may not be compatible with their royal work. Also, the Queen owns their Windsor home Frogmore Cottage , which was renovated to the cost of £.m recently, but surveys suggest the public may not be keen for them to retain it. Itaposs possible that the financially independent royal couple may be required to pay some form of rent to stay there.  Although reportedly left hurt by Harry and Meghanaposs actions, the Queen is not given to rash decisions, and will be approaching the talks in a calm and pragmatic way. One question thrown up is whether the couple will keep their HRH titles but it is thought senior royals are not keen on stripping them of the status. Also, the couple are unlikely to surrender their titles as their aposSussexRoyalapos brand is built on them. Heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles is the future king and currently bankrolls Harry and Meghanaposs public duties through his £ million-a-year Duchy of Cornwall income. The extent to which this will continue seems likely to crop up. The prince is a caring, sensitive soul, and is said to be furious at how Harry and Meghan have handled the situation. He is committed to his royal duty, but will also want his youngest son, who endured the loss of his mother Diana, Princess of Wales, when he was only , and Meghan to be happy. The talks also come amid repeated reports of a falling out between Harry and William. Older brother William, who was said to be incandescent with rage at the Sussexesapos actions, is a future king, and his position within the royal family is vastly dferent from sixth-in-line Harry, who has moved steadily down the line of succession and has to carve out his own role. In his ITV interview on a tour of Africa, Harry conceded that he and William aposhave good days and bad daysapos and are aposon dferent pathsapos. What future working relationship the two princes have will be interesting to see after Harry takes his step back.  For Meghan and Harry, their priorities will be ensuring a smooth retreat from royal le that enables them to fulfil their work with charities and in Africa on the causes that interest them. The Duke and Duchess said in their statement, they want to carve out a progressive new role, and continue to collaborate with the Queen. How their new commercial work ties in with this collaboration with the royal family could be determined by todayaposs talks.  Meghan may have flown back to Canada, but she will likely be dialling into the meeting as the proposals on offer are discussed. The intelligent, driven American former actress, who is just  months into her royal le, will be focused on the work she and Harry are keen to do.

She added: Also, thank you for asking, because not many people have askedIaposm OK. But itaposs a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.  When askedthings had been a struggle, she replied yes. Harry will this afternoon come face to face with the Queen as senior royals race to thrash out plans for his and Meghanaposs future. It follows their announcement that they are aposstepping backapos and want to become aposfinancially independentapos. Todayaposs historic meeting at the Queenaposs private Sandringham estate will be the first time Harry has met with his grandmother, the Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge since the issue engulfed the royal family this week, making headlines around the world.  Meghan is with their baby son Archie in Canada, but a royal source said it is likely she will join the crisis talks by phone. The duchess flew to Canada a few days ago where the family spent an extended festive break in the province of British Columbia.It is thought William will be travelling to the estate in Norfolk from his Kensington Palace apartment and Harry from Frogmore Cottage near Windsor Castle.Charles was in Oman to attend a condolence ceremony following the death of Sultan Qaboos bin Said al Said, and was due to travel back to the UK on Sunday evening. The Queen attended church at Sandringham on Sunday where wellwishers expressed sympathy for her, and clapped as she left, with some members of the public saying that Harry and Meghan should not receive any more taxpayersapos money.  The -year-old monarch was pictured arriving for the service wearing a hearing aid for what is believed to be the first time in public. Harry and Meghan are said to have left the Queen feeling hurt by their bombshell announcement that they plan to step back as senior royals, become financially independent and split their time between the UK and North America. There are a range of issues to be discussed today, and it is likely the royals will try to come to some agreement before the meeting ends to stop the immediate crisis causing lasting damage to the monarchy. Harry and Meghanaposs statement - and a new official Sussexroyal website - have thrown up important questions about funding for the coupleaposs round-the-clock security, media access to their royal events and how they will pay for their future lestyles.  Other important issues to resolve include who will pay for the substantial security cost of protecting the couple and their baby sonthey spend large portions of the year in Canada and possibly America. It is not known what time the family plan to meet, how long the summit is expected to last or whether the entire day has been set aside to find a solution. Before the meeting, the royals will be given written proposals produced by their offices and others, including relevant government departments from the UK and Canada, where it is thought Harry and Meghan will establish a second home. It is not known who ,anyone, will be at the meeting - but it is likely the private secretaries of the four royals may join part of the talks to assist with any questions. On Thursday, the Queen, Charles and William gave orders for their households to work with the Sussexesapos team to quickly find a workable solution to their desire to change the direction of their royal lives, but still support the Queen.

Rachael Fitzgerald and partner Mark Maddocks woke at am on holiday in Crete, Greece, to find their daughter Lara unresponsive in their hotel room. Mark desperately tried to revive the tot, but she was tragically pronounced dead at the scene. Tests were carried out in Greece but experts were unable to establish a cause of death. At an inquest, a doctor said Laraaposs parents from Hale, near Altrincham, Greater Manchester may never know the reason for their daughteraposs unexpected death. The couple had been trying for eight years for their first child, and everything fell into place with the birth of their daughter in March of last year. Born at  weeks Lara was described as being the aposaposperfect little girl with a bigger social le than many adults. She would regularly be out in her buggy with her mother and was affectionately nicknamed Lady Lara. The tragedy occurred on July  last year after the family checked into the Village Heights Hotel in the Greek resort of Hersonissos. The inquest heard that Lara had recently been treated for symptoms of a cold but otherwise appeared to be in perfect health. Miss Fitzgerald told the Stockport hearing: “Her last feed that night was about pm. About am I woke up and I just looked at her though I was facing the other way and turned my head. She was just on her back and just looked very peaceful and normal but I knew that something’s not right. “I said aposLara, Laraapos but she never normally wakes till about am so it was still early really. I didn’t get a response and picked her up and her arm just slipped down and chaos went on from there. Mark grabbed her and tried to resuscitate her. She was warm she wasn’t blue.  “It doesn’t make sense. I’m obsessed with suffocation issues and you just go through these things - but nothing was near her.” Miss Fitzgerald added: aposaposLara was amazing, she liked to be in the buggy it was just a nice greyish silver cross as we didn’t know whether we were having a boy or girl - she had everything.aposapos Mr Maddocks, a Swisspirt aircraft dispatcher, said: “We tried so hard for a long time to have a child - for eight years. But in the end it all worked and Lara was so good she slept a lot and didn’t cry - she was perfect. “She went everywhere with us, she went more places than some people had been in a le time. In the three months, like some of our friends saying where’s Lady Lara lunching today  Was out all the time.” Dr Melanie Newbold, a paediatric pathologist from Manchester Royal Children’s Hospital, said: “I was able to say that Lara looked like a perfect little girl and seemed to be well grown for her age and no problems with growth. “Absolutely no signs of suffocation, no evidence whatsoever that suffocation was involved in her death. “No signs of any illness and internal organs where all perfectly normally formed. No evidence of overwhelming sepsis . Some evidence that she might have had a recent cold like almost everybody had. Other than that no positive findings. Signs of cold wouldn’t have caused her to die.  “Very rare to find evidence of why they have died. It’s not unusual sadly. aposaposOf course when doing the post mortem can identy things that we can see either by the nature of evidence or down a microscope. Many people at all ages not just babies but most frequently in babies because of something that’s happened in there body. “Might just be in the case of a baby just stopping breathing a simple reason. We don’t understand, know that they can take place but can’t identy them at post mortem as there is no evidence that this has happened. “If it was death due to over heating in the sense that she was very very hot there usually would be features here. But there’s no evidence that that was the case for her. “We used to call it sudden death syndrome or cot death, we don’t really understand all the factors might be that we never will.” In a statement read to the court, family GP Dr Helen Symcox, said: “Lara was born at  weeks. Had her first set of immunisations and was seen on June , for upper respiratory tract infection and was a bit snuffly. She was active and alert and smiling and her chest was clear.  “On June , took her to the surgery with what was thought to be another cold and was a bit snuffly and dribbling a bit. But was drinking her milk and having water so had no concerns.” The court heard how the GP spoke to her mother about using sun cream and keeping her hydrated and was happy for her to go on holiday. Recording a conclusion of death by natural causes, coroner Alison Mutch told Laraaposs parents: “It’s clear that she had quite a little personality about her. Also came over in the evidence just how well loved and looked after she was. “She had a very short le but clearly a very happy le and was very very well looked after. What we know is that she had a social le that few of us could ever aspire to and was out and about and loved being out and about. She was obviously a very sociable little girl. “As a family you made the decision to go on holiday and then went to the GP to check they where happy and she was okay for you to go away. It seems like a really lovely place you took her too although memories are very dferent now. aposaposIt seems like it was a really lovely time till the tragedy happened.

Following a series of meetings and consultations across the last few days there are a range of possibilities for the family to review which take into account the thinking the Sussexes outlined earlier in the week.

Today Prince Harry will arrive at his grandmother’s Norfolk estate, where in happier years gone by he has enjoyed warm-hearted Christmas celebrations surrounded by the love and laughter of his closest family. But his latest visit to Sandringham, after he and Meghan turned down the Queen’s invitation to join the festivities last month, will be remembered as one of the most extraordinary days in modern royal history. Summoned by the Queen to meet her, flanked by her eldest son and grandson, there will be no clearer indication of what matters above all  in this family namely, the line of succession and the monarchy. Harry will no doubt feel he is entering the lion’s den, especially without the support of his co-conspirator who has fled to Canada leaving him to face the music alone. But he would do well to remember the family, at their very core, do have his best interests at heart and are keen for him and Meghan to rein back and look at what is at stake for all involved. There would have perhaps been no need for this most extraordinary summit had their enforced and somewhat hastily arranged exit from The Firm not been so poorly executed. He has upset the Queen, angered his father, and his brother William has said the once devoted brothers are now “separate entities” and he can no longer put his arm around himhe doesn’t want to be on the “team”.

Fur-trimmed jackets, shoes, hats and gloves were found with labels either making no mention of their origins or claiming they are synthetic. Investigators bought  fur-trimmed items ranging from £ to £ from markets and stores in Durham, Leeds, London, Newcastle, Stratford-upon-Avon and York, as well as online. All the items were found to contain real animal fur, including a pair of children’s shoes and a baby’s hat. Claire Bass, director of animal rights organisation Humane Society International UK, said: Buyers beware: the plethora of real fur items we found being sold as faux shows avoiding animal fur continues to be a minefield for shoppers. There’s a misconception thata garment is cheap, it is faux fur.” A £. pair of  shoes from web-site Ego were labelled as “black faux fur” but were found to be fox. A £ pair of kids’ plimsolls from EverythingPounds labelled “faux fur trim” were found to contain rabbit. A £ pair of “faux fur” pink diamante trainers from online fashion store Cucu were found to contain rabbit. A Walthamstow Market trader in East London said the pom-pom on a £ baby’s hat was “fake”. He told investigators: “I don’t have real fur as it’s too expensive.” But tests showed otherwise.  A street vendor in Leeds sold us a £ hat, saying: “It’s not animal fur. It would be more expensive. But the pom-pom was found to be raccoon dog fur. A vendor at Stratford Indoor Market, in east London, said it was “not possible to get a pair of real fur gloves for £”, unaware those he sold had a rabbit trim. A YouGov poll found nearly half of shoppers rely on the feel and price of fur to decideit is real. Many still believe real fur is expensive.  But retailers can bulk-buy rabbit fur trim from online wholesalers for as little as £ a metre. Fur farming was banned in the UK in , with the last farm closing in . But it is still legal to import fur, with millions of pounds’ worth flooding in. Clare Bass said: “In most cases, we don’t believe the vendors are deliberately misleading customers. They genuinely believe what they’re selling is faux fur.  Le’s cheap on a fur farm and that misery is reflected in the rock-bottom price.” Cucu Fashion removed the trainers from its site to investigate. It said: “We work with suppliers from the UK and Europe and were advised they don’t use real fur.We’re disappointed they’ve breached our high standards.” Ego fashion said: “Heel Sassy has been taken off the site to be investigated.”"},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather storm brendan brings","story":"NewsUK weather: Storm Brendan brings mph winds to Britain – is your area affected High winds are expected in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland today.

The -year-old, who performed at The Dorchester Hotel for  years, has played for celebrities including Shirley Bassey, Kate Moss, Simon Cowell and Jools Holland. But mingling with celebrities didn’t stop his descent into poverty after he was violently attacked and forced to give up his job. He now wants to shed light on the dficulties of living on Universal Credit, as he claims the threat of sanctions hangs over him despite applying for  jobs a week. Since May, Lee has been in the Better Working Futures programme which aims to get people with dficulties back into work but claims he has been offered unsuitable work he must accept.Are you a struggling parent on Universal Credit  Email  webnews@mirrorThe pianist, whose stage name was Lee Mathews, said: “It’s been tough. “I’ve been on that programme since May and all they do is tick boxes every week I go. “The people they have there are not qualied to deal with people who have had previous mental health problems. “I’d be rooting around in bins or use food banksI got sanctioned. “The entire thing isn’t fit for purpose.” Lee had always played the piano and went from gigging at local restaurants to being put forward for the £k job at the Dorchester when he was . He also played at other top London venues including the Savoy, Claridge’s and the Lanesborough, with a steady stream of A-listers hearing him tinkle the ivories.  Visitors also remarked on TripAdvisor what a superb player he was when enjoying their afternoon tea at the landmark Dorchester. But in June  he was violently attacked after meeting someone from an internet dating site. The assault, which left him in hospital for three days, led him to suffer a breakdown and PTSD. He tried to continue working but found the constant stream of gigs too much and eventually had to give up his rented home near Rickmansworth, Herts. After living in a string of hostels and BnBs, Lee eventually went home to Durham to live with his parents in December  as he battled to get over the assault. He signed on in January  and was put on Universal Credit, earning benefits of £-a-month plus housing benefit of £ when he found his own flat. He also had counselling and financial help from Help Musicians UK, a charity which supports struggling musicians in times of hardship.  He says he is desperate to get his old career back and has been playing at weddings and parties in the north east to earn a bit of spare cash. He also regularly travels down to London to take any gig he can - even though the travel costs often mean he makes nothing. Since May this year he has been on the Better Working Futures programme, run by employment agency Reed, which tries to help people who face additional barriers get back into work. But he says he has been offered driving jobs he can’t do alongside other positions he simply isn’t qualied for. And even sending out  emails a week enquiring about work is not enough to stop him being threatened with his money being cut off, he says. Lee said: “I had points on my licence and they tried to get me sanctioned for not applying for a job as a delivery driver. “He said I’d be sanctionedI refused to do the interview. It caused me a lot of upset. “I thought I’d lose my benefits and when you get sanctioned you have no money for a long period of time, sometimes three months. “I’m doing  job applications a week and it’s still not enough for them. “The people they are employing to help people like me are making their conditions worse. “The interviews they are doing are uncomfortable and I feel like I’m being harassed and forced to take on jobs I’m not qualied to do. “They’re not interested in helping me further my career.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailHarry and Meghan got it wrong. Plain and simple. While many sympathise with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s desire to step back as senior Royals, the way they chose to do it has provoked justiable shock and outrage. Petulant, hot-headed and impulsive are just some of the barbs aimed at the couple after the bombshell public announcement that they wished to become part-time Royals and live much of the time abroad. Inconsiderate, disloyal and reckless might also be appropriate. In more than  years on the throne, the Queen has shown with impeccable style, dignity and judgement how the “old firm” should be run. The sacrices she and other members of the Royal Family have made have been not only for the monarchy, but for the nation.  That, by the antiquated system of a monarchic state, is their responsibility by birth. And Her Majesty embraced that responsibility with grace, as even republicans admit. Harry and Meghan’s wish to break away might be seen as an understandable cry for modernisation. Their desire to do so has been evident for a long time. But discussing their intentions with friends such as Elton John before the Queen, and going ahead with their announcement without thinking through the full impact on their family or the monarchy, has caused a totally avoidable crisis. That the Queen has had to intervene – calling a Royal showdown at Sandringham tomorrow to deal with the crisis – is a measure of the scale of the embarrassment caused.  She is right to step in and call the wayward couple to heel. Only she has the authority to bang heads together and ensure a smoother route to whatever the future holds. The Wrong Cure  The crisis in our health service starts at the front line, the family doctor. The GP is an absolute cornerstone of the National Health Service, the first stop for all ages from cradle to grave. It is a service that is essential to personal health, and to the economy of the country. With a shortage of at least , GPs, Tory promises of more on the way are not enough. Government action on over-complicated red tape preventing overseas doctors from coming here to ease the gap is long overdue. Rocking On Rod Stewart is a national treasure who just refuses to act his age.

Jason Smith, , met Azarel Smith, now , on online dating site  Match  in February . Office manager Azarel was just  years old at the time they first agreed to meet up for a dinner date. Jason, a lawyer, said he was swept away by Azarel’s beauty as sparks flew for the couple, although they were sceptical of each other’s intentions at first. After dating on and off for the first few years, love prevailed and Jason popped the question in  during their trip to Las Vegas. The pair are now engaged and living together with plans for marriage in the near future. Jason, who was married once before, admitted he wanted to date younger women because he thought the “sex would be better” and didn’t want to be pressurised into marriage and kids. He said: “Being with a younger girl is exciting. She introduces me to new adventures, new songs, lingo etc. She has a more open mind when it comes to the world and obviously a better body. “She’s made me a much happier man. She’s supportive of me and business. Something I was missing when single. She has a way of keeping me focused and really mindful of the world. “Truthfully, I thought the sex would be better. “That she was less likely to push for immediate marriage and kids. I just really wanted a relationship where I didn’t feel like there would be that kind of pressure. “Also, I felt like I was at an age where I had the time and money to entertain someone ‘fresh’. In reality I can’t say the reason sex is better is because of age. I would have to credit it to being more in love now. “But she does have a better body than the older women I’ve dated. Which I’m sure makes things more enjoyable as well.” However, the pair abstained from sex within the first few years of their relationship under Azarel’s wishes. She said: “We abstained from sex the first few years of our relationship. Jason was very respectful of my choice and treated me like a lady. “The no sex didn’t deter him from doing nice things or loving me. Respect I wasn’t used to getting from guys.” Since they began dating, the pair have been swept up in a whirlwind romance and always teach each other new things, saying how that is a fundamental part of being in a relationship with someone. Azarel, who is interested in going to law school, said that Jason has given her much needed help and guidance when it comes to her career and even personal le.  Speaking about their relationship, she said: “You get to be with someone who has experienced more of le, so they can give really wise input to help you make better decisions. “Whether that be with your professional le, or personal le. For instance, I just finished my bachelors and trying to figure out my next steps. “I’m interested in getting into law school and Jason has been there to help me through the process since he’s already done it himself.” She added: “I’ve experienced a lot that I could have only dreamed about doing before him. For the first time in a relationship, I truly am able to be my naturally mature self and feel like I fit in. “Which I didn’t feel dating guys my age. I’ve gained a lot of confidence in myself.” However, the pair admitted they do face challenges because of their -year age gap but over the years, they have learnt how to make their relationship work, insisting how they are “best friends” before anything. Jason said: “We are so dferent. Almost too dferent to get bored of each other. Fingers crossed. “Also, we are truly best friends before anything. We’ve built a strong base for our relationship. It would take a lot for anyone to break us apart. “Azarel has a very strong personality so she can be a bit hard headed and snappy. But I know just how to ‘handle’ her. “Sometimes there’s stuff we obviously can’t relate about and the fact we are at dferent places in le. However, I don’t feel like any of that is a signicant dficulty.” Meanwhile, Azarel said: “Jason does small things like repeats everything he says to me x, and make phone calls in the car while I’m sleeping that can be very annoying.” The -year-old, who has just graduated from university with a bachelor’s degree, said that dating an older man feels much more stable than having two millennials trying to “figure out le” at the same time, which can bring added stress into a relationship. She said: “Not really, I think the relationship runs a little bit more smoothly because you don’t have two millennials trying to figure out le. When one of you are older, it feels a bit more stable.” Both Jason and Azarel’s family and friends are supportive of their relationship, though sometimes Jason receives the unsolicited advice to “watch out” when dating someone younger.

Some things you might get away with when it’s more open, you don’t.“Inverness were good at it last week. They sit with six players behind the ball and maybe cheat with a couple up the park and counter you well.“We need to find the answers to open teams up.”Dundee’s form going into last weekend’s clash with Caley Thistle was good with two wins and two draws in their previous four.However, consistency has consistently been the downfall for the Dark Blues this season.That four-game spell in December was their best since August and Hemmings knows it’s something the team have to improve on.He added: “We’re tired talking about it, to be honest.“We’ve had moments where we think we’re getting there and we’re away on a good run but have games like Inverness last week.“We can’t just do it for three or four games but we need seven or eight in a row to really assert ourselves.“The performances going back to the second half against Arbroath had been really good.“We’ve been positive in the way we’ve played, some good performances.“Last week was a chance to close the gap on Inverness and go level on points with them. It was disappointing in that regard.“This will be another big game because Ayr are a good team and we need to pick ourselves back up.”Tomorrow’s clash comes after tests against league leaders Dundee United, second-placed Inverness and ahead of a dficult Scottish Cup tie at home to high-flying Premiership side Motherwell.It’s a testing run for the players but Hemmings is relishing the chance to get back out and into a big match.He said: “It is good to have another big game this weekend.“We knew there were three big home games in a row with the Scottish Cup the week after.“That’s what you want – you always want to test yourself as a player.“It’s a good game to jump back into.”The last meeting with Ayr saw Dundee leave Somerset Park with an impressive - victory. That night saw plenty of tackles flying about and Hemmings expects no dferent this time around.“Whatever way they go, it’ll be a dficult game for us, we know that.“It was a tough game down there and a bit tasty as well – I expect the same this weekend.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/19755586-940x551.jpg ","title":"dundee 0 2 inverness dismal dee drop to fourth with ict defeat","story":"Dundee dropped to fourth in the Championship table as they fell to a - defeat to Inverness at Dens Park.First-half goals from Aaron Doran and James Keatings did the damage as John Robertson#s Caley Jags strengthened their grip on second spot.Ayr winning at Dunfermline meant the Dark Blues dropped to the fourth and final promotion play-off spot,  points behind leaders Dundee United.Dee boss James McPake stuck with the same line-up which earned a point in the Dundee derby with -year-old Fin Robertson starting in the middle of the park after a terric display at Tannadice.Inverness were the first to threaten but Nikolay Todorov could only head Miles Storey#s cross over the bar after three minutes.Caley skipper Carl Tremarco went closer on nine minutes as he got on the end of another Storey cross after a period of pressure. However, Dark Blues keeper Jack Hamilton gathered the header comfortably.Hamilton then made a smart stop from a whipped Keatings free-kick minutes later as the visitors continued to push for the opener.On  minutes Charlie Trafford forced a routine save out of Hamilton before, just a minute later, Inverness got the goal their play deserved.In acres of space down the right, full-back Shaun Rooney had the freedom of Dens Park to pick out Doran in the centre of the box and the Irish attacker duly lashed home from  yards.On  minutes, ICT were two to the good. From their own corner, Dundee compounded to lose possession and allowed the Highlanders to break.Former Dundee United man Keatings led the charge and finished the counter attack off himself, coolly slotting beyond a helpless Hamilton in the home goal.The Dark Blues huffed and puffed for the remainder of a dismal first half for them but were unable to lay a glove on Inverness as the boos rang out among the sizeable home support on the half-time whistle.Four minutes into the second period, Dundee forced Mark Ridgers into his first save of the afternoon as the ICT goalie stooped to turn Jordan Marshall#s long-range effort behind for a corner.Jordan McGhee was next to test Ridgers, firing in a dipping effort just before the hour mark, but the Caley stopper was able to gather.Moments later, Paul McGowan#s header from a deep Sean Mackie cross forced Ridgers to tip over as the Dee sought a way back into the contest.On  minutes, Kane Hemmings laid in Marshall but the left-back saw his effort from  yards deflected behind.Inverness# front four continued to look threatening but, largely, the Dee defence kept them quiet in the second .However, McPake#s men were unable to carve a way through an organised ICT defence with the rookie boss cutting a frustrated and under-pressure figure throughout.With Ayr and Dunfermline to face next, Dundee will certainly need to perform a lot betterthey are to stay in the mix for the promotion play-offs come the end of the season.Dundee XI : HamiltonKerr, Meekings , McGhee, Marshall Robertson, Dorrans, McGowan, MackieJohnson , Hemmings.Subs not used: Ferrie , Forster, Byrne, Moore and Cameron.Inverness XI : RidgersRooney, Donaldson, McHattie, TremarcoTrafford , Vincent StoreyKeatings Doran Todorov .Subs not used: Mackay , McCart, Curry and MacGregor.Referee: Don Robertson.Att: ,."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/SNS-19595223-Dundee-United-v-Dunfermline-803x564.jpg ","title":"lawrence shankland has full focus on united as they hunt title","story":"He’s a wanted man in the January transfer window but Dundee United hitman Lawrence Shankland says it would be criminal for him to take his eyes off the prize as they hunt down the Championship title.United sit  points clear at the top of the table with  games left to play and -goal talisman Shanks insists his full focus is on getting the Tangerines over the line, not the speculation linking him with a move away from Tannadice.The -year-old Scotland striker has been linked with teams both sides of the border but he says until United tell him dferently, it’s all guns blazing in their quest for silverware.“I don’t take interest in it, to be honest,” he said.“I’ve said before that until someone from Dundee United comes to speak to me about it then it’s none of my business really.“It’s all just speculation and rumours, so I won’t take any interest in it at all.“If the time comes when somebody does speak to me then I’ll deal with it then but it’s not something I’m getting too caught up with.“I’m really enjoying it here and the team’s going well, firing at the top of the league, so I don’t see why I’d be choking to get out.“We need to be looking forward now because we’ve got ourselves a good gap at the top.“It would be silly for us to ignore that because we’ve got ourselves in a good position but that’s only the case right now.“We need to kick on and keep winning games because,we keep doing that, the closer we’ll get and the less wins we’ll need.“Until that point we’ll just need to keep taking it one game at a time, batting them off and picking up three points most weeks.”Shankland will come up against his former boss at Ayr United, Ian McCall, as the Terrors head to Glasgow to take on his current side Partick Thistle tomorrow.And he admits United are wary of a team who have won three out of their last five in the league.“It’s going to be a tough game, especially down there,” he added.“Last time we were - down and had to come back after half-time.

The squad and players they’ve got have quality but maybe just haven’t picked up until now.“They’ve turned it around since the start of the season, so it will be a tough fixture again.”Without a goal in his last two games, by his remarkably high standards, Shankland is experiencing a drought he’s keen to end. vw, px\"  He said: “Last season I did the same, scoring loads up until January then I picked up a wee injury and only scored one every two games, so it wasn’t a bad rate!“Everybody jumped on the bandwagon that I hadn’t scored but it was one in two, soI can do that for the rest of the season I’d be quite happy again.“The main thing for me is getting back on the scoresheet this week.”However, he is pleased to see others like Nicky Clark now chipping in.“It was always going to happen, it was never going to be one guy scoring the goals the full time.“We know that the boys will chip in. It just took Clarky to get his first goal and then he kicked on from there.“It’s the same for a lot of people but I don’t really care who scores, to be honest, as long as we’re picking up three points each week I’ll be quite happy.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/01/19787695-940x545.jpg ","title":"partick thistle 1 4 dundee united perfect hat trick from shankland sends utd 17 clear","story":"Dundee United went  points clear at the top of the Championship as a perfect hat-trick from Lawrence Shankland sent them on their way to aShankland opened the scoring at Firhill with a header on  minutes, with strikes on either foot coming in the second half after Adrian Sporle had made it - on the stroke of half-time.Kenny Miller pulled a late goal back for the Jags but three points means the Tangerines are now  points clear of Inverness at the top of the Championship.United showed two changes from last weekend#s win at Queen of the South with captain Mark Reynolds and new boy Dillon Powers coming in for his debut in place of Jamie Robson and Calum Butcher.Partick had an early penalty shout for handball but referee Willie Collum waved away the claims and instead pointed for a corner.Lawrence Shankland headed straight at Scott Fox in the home goal from a deep Nicky Clark free-kick moments later as the game began to settle down.Benjamin Siegrist in the United net had the simplest of saves from James Penrice on  minutes before Declan Glass dragged a shot wide up the other end.The cut-up pitch, due to the wet conditions in Glasgow, saw much of the build-up from both teams bogged down but, of the good football on show, it was the Terrors with the lion#s share.Glass troubled Fox again on  minutes with a dipping, bouncing effort. However, the best chance of the opening half hour was the Jags#.A lung-busting run from Dario Zanatta nearly paid idends for the hosts but Siegrist#s legs foiled the Canadian inside the penalty area.Paul Watson saw a header drt wide from a Clark delivery before Shankland teed up Glass, only for the -year-old to fire wide once again.Zanatta once more came close on  minutes, this time glancing a Joe Cardle delivery towards goal but into the grateful arms of Siegrist.Just a minute later, the Tangerines No  was again the thorn in Thistle#s side.On his own in the six-yard box, Kenny Miller picked up on Zanatta#s cross only for the big Swiss keeper to pull off a wonder save to deny Miller from close range.Clark forced Fox into action with an audacious effort from some  yards before the former Dundee keeper halted Shankland close in.However, moments later, Shanks wasn#t to be denied his nd United goal of the season.From a Clark corner, the Scotland star had the freedom of the Thistle box to guide a header beyond a helpless Fox for - on  minutes.And Shankland was at the heart of United#s second. Picking up on the ball in the middle of the Partick half, he drove forward and slipped in Glass.The United kid#s cross-cum-shot found Adrian Sporle with the simplest of tasks to tap home unopposed for his first league goal for the club.After a frenetic first period, the second  took a while to get going but it was Ian McCall#s side on the front foot.Just before the hour-mark, the impressive Reece Cole made a powerful run into the box before his effort won the Jags a corner.However, it was United who got the scoring under way in the second half and took control with the first chance of note in the period.And it was that man Shankland again as he went on a terric -yard solo run into the Partick box before calmly slotting beyond Fox for his second of the afternoon and the Terrors# third.Peter Pawlett completed his comeback from injury on  minutes when he replaced Paul Watson.And, just a minute later, his first involvement in the game was to tee up Shankland for his third, completing a perfect hat-trick by thundering a left-foot drive into the top corner to send the ,-strong visiting support wild.One of few worries for United on the afternoon came on  minutes when Clark had to limp off injured, to be replaced by Adam King.Miller netted a late consolation for Thistle on  minutes but Robbie Neilson#s men took all the points and another step towards sealing the title.Partick Thistle XI : FoxWilliamson , Saunders, O#Ware , Penrice Cardle , Bannigan, Cole, Zanatta Jones , Miller.Subs not used: Sneddon , Harkins, Slater and Mansell.Dundee United XI : SiegristSmith, Watson , Connolly, ReynoldsPowers Appere, Glass , Clark , Sporle Shankland.Subs not used: Deniz , Sow, Stanton and Freeman.Referee: Willie Collum.Att: , ."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey -

Its dog-eared pages contain neatly-typed records, precise drawings and fascinating photographs.The log#s mystery is deepened by the fact no names are given other than the nicknames #Tanky#, #Bosun#, #Skipper# and #Pilot#. The only crew member named is pet dachshund #Major#.The log does record the Fulmar#s home port was Tighnabruaich and the owner was RG Mowat, but few details on Mr Mowat could be found.Lord Weir of Lochhead, Achahoish, contacted the newspaper to pass on information on Commander Ralph G Mowat.During the Second World War, Commander Mowat was a Royal Navy Captain, latterly in command of a cruiser. At the end of the war, he and his ship entered Copenhagen, where he took the surrender of the German troops.Clive Brown from Ardfern added some post-war detail. He revealed: #Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , was a distinguished member of Clyde Cruising Clubbest known as being, for  years, the honorary editor of the CCC Sailing Directions . These were # and indeed remain # a #must have# for everyone who navigates their way among the many lochs and islands of Scotland#s west coast. They were colloquially known as the #Blue Book# and published at that time as a hardback. He also served as CCC Rear Commodore -.#Mr Brown also provided an extract from the book #Clyde Cruising Club, The First One Hundred Years -# which states Ralph Mowat received an RYA Award for services to yachting in  but refused to accept honorary membership of the club. In recompense, his widow Mary was elected an honorary member in , after his death.Tighnabruaich man Alan Wilson contacted Clyde sailing legend Ian Nicolson, who was fairly sure he recalled racing against the #Fulmar# in the s.Mr Nicolson said:#Old Man Mowat, as I remember him, was a typical ex Royal Navy officer. He treated me as a young upstart, which I was, but we got on well because I wrote a bit for Clyde Cruising Club publications. He lived in Clarkston on the edge of Glasgow.#Clyde Cruising Club itself cannot help with information on the Fulmar. Club secretary Jenner Rollands contacted the Advertiser and confirmed CCC sadly lost all its records when the Carrick, moored on the River Clyde, sank in . At the time, the club#s office was aboard her.Closer to home, Ardrishaig man Billy Paterson called into the Advertiser offices to say his father, Ardrishaig Primary School headmaster Gilbert Paterson, had crewed the yacht Fulmar.Mr Paterson still has mementoes from his father#s trips in the form of gts from Commander Mowat, including a paperweight from , a copper and brass barrel ashtray dated  and a brass model yacht with #Fulmar # engraved on it.Thanks to everyone who contacted the Advertiser with their memories.We now know a little more about Commander Ralph G Mowat, RN , owner of the Fulmar.Details about the crew of #Tanky#, #Bosun# and #Pilot# remain, however, sketchy, soanyone out there knows any more#"},{"url":null,"title":"my new year resolution is","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards"},{"url":null,"title":"plenty of christmas room at the inn","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowInveraray Senior Citizens committee hosted its annual Christmas lunch in the Inveraray Inn.The event, on Sunday December  for senior citizens of Inveraray, was well attended with everyone enjoying a delicious meal and musical entertainment provided by Lochgilphead#s Easy Club.During the festivities, the committee presented flowers to Diane MacDonald, who is retiring from the committee after nine years."},{"url":null,"title":"a mid argyll rugby blast from the past","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Donald Carmichael handed in this black and white photograph of a Mid Argyll Rugby Club team of many decades ago.But can our readers name the players  And what background can you give us about this photograph and Mid Argyll Rugby club at the time Contact the Argyllshire Advertiser by email: editor@argyllshireadvertiser with any information."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column december 27 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLooking back over the last  months, no single story has dominated the headlines in these pages, but there have been important themes.There are the negative trends, of course.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods. A steady run over the opening two stages, Dougie and Ian found their feet after the #off# at the Speyside sent them into service lying th. From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

The existing junction in front of QMU would also be modied from a give-way ghost island T-junction to a signalised junction with greater capacity to hold turning traffic.The proposed scheme would, through the provision of an underpass beneath the A and slip roads to the northbound carriageway of the A, enable traffic movement from QMU and the new development to access the A northbound directly.Street lighting is proposed to be installed extended to include the new section of Queen Margaret Drive which would be provided under the A to the proposed roundabout junction. Street lighting would also be provided on the new slip roads.The proposals also include foot and cycle paths, two SUDS ponds, mitigation planting of native woodland to the main junction, structure tree planting, marginal planting to the proposed SUDS areas, and more ornamental planting to the areas near the QMU campus.Colin Beattie, Musselburgh MSP, said: ldquoWhile I welcome improvements to the road system which will accommodate the exciting new business developments around QMU, I am less enthusiastic about the huge expansion of housing, albeit much-needed, adjacent to QMU.ldquoThey will substantially increase the traffic on that stretch of road.

I knew that at some point I would have got a telegram but with our anniversary being on Boxing Day, I didnrsquot know when it would be.Marlene, who has always been heavily involved in the community, said she was ldquopassionate about where she lives.She got involved with the villagersquos gala committee when her children were young and went on to serve Cockenzie  Port Seton Community Council for  years.She has also been the chair of Cockenzie and Port Seton In Bloom for  years and was the chair of the community centre advisory committee before there was even a Port Seton Centre.She is still on the management committee for the centre and said she never thought she would live to see the new sports hall that she has passionately campaigned for, which is due to be finished by August.Marlene met her husband Stan, who was living in Leith at the time, ldquoquite by accident, she said.ldquoStanrsquos friendrsquos mother had a hut at the [Seton Sands] caravan site and the boys used to come down at the weekends [from Edinburgh], she said.ldquoI was going down to buy cigarettes for my friend and Stan shouted something out of the window of a car at me, and afterwards we realised we worked quite close to each other.ldquoI worked at the McEwanrsquos brewery [in Fountainbridge] as a telephonist and Stan worked for the North British Rubber Company at the time.ldquoWe used to meet at lunchtime and then Stan got into the habit of coming to Port Seton every weekend.

I remember my father saying: lsquoI will give you six months.rsquoldquoWe had a lot of hard times, we were young and foolish and hard up, but for some unknown reason we managed to take the kids on holiday every year and buy them their season tickets for the swimming pool. We had to save all year for them.ldquoFor the young, I would say not to marry young. Irsquom very proud that none of my children have followed in our footsteps.ldquoI would say [in marriage] it is important to always be mindful of one another and try to be toleranthellip never keep an argument going. It is too easy nowadays to walk away but you just have to keep going. I wanted to kill him some days and it was probably likewise but we have had a great le together.ldquoWe feel very lucky to have reached this age and that all of our children have got good lives, and their children are just a delight to have around.In their retirement, Marlene and Stan have travelled most of the Mediterranean and much of Europe together, and enjoy looking after their grandchildren, who all live in the county."},{"url":null,"title":"first-scots-baby-new-decade-born-port-seton-parents","story":"The little boy - whose name has still to be revealed - entered the world at .am todayat the Simpson Centre for Reproductive Health at theRoyal Infirmary of Edinburgh.Weighing in atlbs oz, he is the first child for mother Emma Allan, , and father Cameron Cunningham, , both of Castle Avenue, Post Seton.The parents said they were \"delighted\" with the new arrival.

I was alone and deep in thought. I cannot remember now exactly what the issue was, but something had happened that seemed to be unfair, and it had made me angry.It was a windy and cold day. The tide was in and the waves rolling and crashing created a kind of meditative sound. I donrsquot know how long I sat there, as time seemed to dissolve as I listened to the sea, and smelt the salt air.Later I walked by the shore, again alone, and I remember how my mood had changed.My memory of that day fades at this point: I cannot recall what happened as I ed home. But clearly the sea had done its job in calming my emotional state.Memories are not like books on a shelf which we can take out and look at, and then . Our memories are really about emotions rather than happenings. We connect to the emotions first, our brain then does a search for the events associated with the emotion. Songs, smell, sounds and places can trigger emotion which then leads to associations with actual events.So itrsquos the emotion attached to events which will mark it as signicant. Thatrsquos why we remember the unusual moments more than the everyday ones. We remember the events when our emotions were aroused, either positively or negatively.That day I was angry. The sea was pretty much on our doorstep, so it was probably an obvious place to go to be alone, away from my siblings, to rage at the injustice I felt. But it was a good choice, because the sea has a powerful ability to heal.There seems to be a sense by some that the sea is a place to go only when itrsquos sunny and warm. In fact, the gts of the sea are given all year round, and it is winter time, or a time of storm and wind, that the sea becomes a powerful place to find naturersquos healing.How lucky we are to live in a county where we have  miles of coastline, much of it close to communities and accessible. Those with a sense of adventure and physical ability to do so can find parts of the coast to themselves, even in busy times.But as I learnt all those years ago, the sea can speak to us directly. Simply sitting by it, or walking along the shore while sharing our thoughts, can be a powerful form of mental as well as physical healing.Some take this a step further by bathing in the sea on a regular basis ndash yes, even in the winter. There are real benefits to swimming in a cold sea, both in terms of mental and physical health. But I think it helpsothers do it with you, as an encouragement! The Loony Dooks which take place at North Berwick, Dunbar and where around the coast should be a weekly event, not a yearly one!But we donrsquot need to be in the sea to feel its benefits, just by it and connected to it mentally, and yes, spiritually. This is a serious point. We have an epidemic of mental health issues, and while there is no one simple explanation or solution, we need to understand the signicance of our disconnection from nature and its impact on our mental health. Spending time by the sea is a tonic for body and mind.I think we felt this last week when we headed for the rocks at North Berwick on Boxing Day. It was here that Robert Louis Stevenson played as a boy and discovered a small cave in which he imagined tales of pirates and smugglers. The island of Fidra, said to be his inspiration for Treasure Island, can be seen further along the coast.The tide was in, so it wasnrsquot possible to see the cave. But in scrambling over the rocks, discovering other things and sitting by the waves, the sea did its magic for our family and myself. The waves were crashing andyou studied how they hit the rocks you could see how the hand of the sea had carved them in certain ways.We sat and explored there ndash not noticing the nippy wind ndash for a good hour. It was an overcast afternoon and darkness fell soon. But the walk along the beach to the town for a hot chocolate was the final part of the therapy!Our coastline is a gt for us and we need to use it, and respect it, more. The beaches, coves and clfs of our county are a true treasure. Try spending more time with them, listening and experiencing the sea, walking or sitting with it.I promise you, you will feel better, and have a story to tell.Happy New Year."},{"url":null,"title":"new-mcbrave-games-event-held-musselburgh","story":"The action-packed event, called McBrave Games, promises participants a uniquely Scottish experience with events such as tug orsquo war, tossing the caber, putting the shot, the hill race, weechinrsquo the welly and a Highland fling.There will also be a Scottish twist on challenges along the km obstacle course to test participants.The event takes place on Saturday, May , at Newhailes House.Participants can take on the challenge as a solo entrant or enter as a clan of four with colleagues or friends to battle it out to become the laddie or lassie of McBrave Games.Co-founders Jo Dytch and Andrew Hastings are confident the creativity and innovation behind the event will encourage entrants to try something new in .Jo and Andrew bring with them more than  yearsrsquo combined experience in the mass participation space on large-scale events such as Race for Le, Tough Mudder and the -mile Cateran Yomp.Commenting on the inspiration behind the event, Jo said: ldquoScotland is an inspiring and magical place.

and other unmarked areas of the car park which were not designated bays.It was, the council said, a way to illustrate the need for additional car parking in Haddington.Now the council has confirmed it is planning to introduce new traffic regulations which will stop people from parking outside spaces in the packed car park.A spokesperson said: ldquoA report will be presented to our cabinet meeting in January with proposals to introduce double yellow lines to the long-stay car park.This is to improve safety and reduce damage to the kerbs and road surfaces caused by indiscriminate parking.ldquoFollowing cabinet, the proposals will be subject to a statutory process before the necessary regulations could be introduced.Last October, the council introduced similar restrictions in its own staff car park at John Muir House, Haddington, which lies a short distance from the long-stay facility.That saw dozens of workers receive fines, from the team of private parking wardens employed by the council, for ignoring new yellow lines in their own car park.The long-stay car park in Haddington is on land owned by East Lothian Council and accessed through the adjoining short-stay

This is a fascinating and picturesque structure from the th century, which lies semi-hidden amongst the trees that cling onto the steep sides of the slope.Dunglass is such a beautul area, and the ancient Dunglass Collegiate Church, dating from the th century, is one of its architectural jewels. Itrsquos open to the elements now, but well preserved and a popular place for weddings.The castle that once stood nearby is long gone. A more modern house sits on the spot where a mansion once stood, and before that the castle. Being on the main route south, the castle inevitably saw action during the ious times of war with England, being burned and damaged on a number of occasions in the s.But in August , the castle was effectively blown up in a huge explosion, and a version of events emerged which placed the blame on a vengeful servant called Edward Paris.It was a time of war and religious rage. Thomas the nd Earl of Haddington was leading a Covenanting force charged with defending this important route from the south, as the Covenanting army had entered England a few days earlier. He had established his force at Dunglass Castle, an obvious strategic location, to defend the armyrsquos rear.On that fateful day, August , , he was said to be in conversation with some fellow nobles when a huge explosion erupted from the vaults, instantly demolishing the central part of the castle which became little more than a pile of debris.Thomas and many others were killed, their bodies pulled from the rubble. They had been crushed by the collapse of the walls in the explosion.History has repeatedly recorded the names of the nobles killed on that day, but there were many others, as the castle was busy and full of people. Fty-four unnamed lsquocommon servantsrsquo were killed, and more than  other people badly injured, some later dying of their injuries.Edward Paris was Thomasrsquos servant and he has been blamed for this tragedy. The th-century writer Andrew Stevenson claimed Edward had the keys to the vault in which huge amounts of gunpowder had been stored, and he had been ldquoseduced by the enemies of the covenant to commit this act. He was an Englishman and another account says he was incensed at derogatory remarks made by Thomas about his countrymen.Irsquove always thought this explanation never really had the ring of truth. It was initially deemed an accident, and the story of Edwardrsquos role emerged later, instigated by a writer called William Lithgow, a man who had certain axes to grind. In one account, Edward is said to have thrust a hot poker into the gunpowder or set fire to it. The detail of this is suspect in itself, for who survived as a witness to this act  I suspect that a dreadful accident, possibly caused by incompetence and carelessness, was turned into a deliberate act of vengeance as it made a more useful explanation.Of course, it is very possible that Edward was offended or annoyed at things said by his master, and perhaps he mentioned this at some stage, later to be used as evidence of his guilt. But in truth, most servants will have seen or heard things which will have offended them, it was a part of their job.Imagineservants had been able to write and publish the things they had overheard and seen, what dferent historical narratives we would have!Motives for wanting to interpret the cause of the explosion in this way can be guessed at. It was a time of atrocity and massacre, with religious, political and national hatreds. Who was responsible for the dangerous stockpiling of the gunpowder in such a manner  It seems just too easy to blame a disgruntled servant. Even later, when writing up this period, religious and political loyalties influenced interpretation.If Edward Paris really did venture down to the vaults of Dunglass Castle on that fateful day, with the intention of committing suicide in order to kill his master, along with dozens of others, then he must have been infected with a deep hatred, as well as a total disregard for the lives of his fellow servants and his own.The truth is we will never know what really happened.

A marine licence is in place until the end of May, with work to be complete before then.At the same time, plans are being drawn up for a second phase of work, which would see the creation of a breakwater at the northern end of the beach.A marine licence will be needed for that piece of work, with the hope that could be in place before the end of May to allow work to simply continue from the first phase.If that is not possible, the contractor will leave the site andat a later date to construct the northern breakwater.Mrs Swan, who is also chairwoman of Dunbar Shore and Harbour Neighbourhood Group, encouraged people to head along to the public exhibition, which takes place between pm and pm.Those in attendance can speak to the consultants and East Lothian Council about the plans.Mrs Swan added: ldquoI think it is really, really important for people to come to the exhibition for two reasons.ldquoOne is to understand the thinking that has gone into the regeneration project and the other one is to become aware of the impact it might have on them during the construction weeks because it is going to be at least six weeks and it could run into months.ldquoThe nature of the breakwater is they are built of huge rocks, between three and six tonnes, and they are all coming from the quarry at Markle.

He was said to have been martyred at sea with an anchor round his neck and was therefore regarded as the patron saint of sailors. The cult of Clement spread to Scandinavia in about the th century and then to Britain.ldquoSt Clements Wells were probably named by Scandinavians living in the Tranent area.ldquoWe know they were here because of the presence of a powerful landholder of likely Scandinavian descent, Thor of Tranent, son of Swain, who is mentioned in many th-century charters. He held extensive lands in the area and granted the church of Tranent to Holyrood Abbey.Mr Hadden said: ldquoI am sure the new stone sculptures will add another piece of culture to our area when in place to the east and west sides of Wallyford alongside those we have already.ldquoThese include the mining memorial stone and coal hutches located at St Clements Housing estate just off Salters Road, the  mining stones at the Wallyford Bing, a community woodland depicting dferent mining scenes, and also the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh memorial at the west side of Wallyford.The shapes and patterns proposed relate to the themes of the wells, water, ripples, distilling, agriculture and the sense of space and open skies of the site as it is now. The overall idea is that the artwork reflects past, present and future heritages of the area.There will also be two St Clements Wells name  per entrance in stone, either hand carved or sandblasted.The idea for a stone village sign for Wallyford is also being explored in a design reflecting the ideas of crossing a river or burn by a ford.A spokesman for East Lothian Developments said: ldquoEast Lothian Developments are delighted to be working with Susheila and James to deliver ious artworks at St Clements Wells.ldquoThey have shown real enthusiasm and creativity with the ideas they have brought forward to capture something of the history of St Clements Wells and design pieces which we hope will do justice to the entrances of the development, and spark interest from all those who will pass them.ldquoWe were very grateful to the community council for their comments and input to the designs.Elaine Di Troia was appointed vice-chairman at the AGM, Sharon Jamieson secretary and Beryl Stevenson treasurer.

They havenrsquot respected the result of the  referendum and they havenrsquot respected the result of the  one.In fact, the Edinburgh Agreement does not include a cast-iron commitment by the Scottish Government to uphold and respect the result, but a more ambiguous aspiration that the result will be fair and clear enough to command respect.The text states the UK and Scottish ldquogovernments are agreed that the referendum shouldhellip deliver a fair test and a decisive expression of the views of people in Scotland and a result that everyone will respect.The governments also ldquolook forward to a referendum that is legal and fair producing a decisive and respected outcome.But the SNP could still argue that, despite those high hopes, respect for the result has proved ephemeral because of Brexit.Mr Jackrsquos ruling out of a Section  order eventhere is another SNP majority at Holyrood is a complete reversal of Mr Jackrsquos position in November.Then, he was askedthe SNP winning most of Scotlandrsquos  seats in the general election would give it a democratic mandate for a Section  order, and replied: ldquoNo.Asked why not, he said: ldquoBecause the democratic mandate for a Section  order is a matter for .

The fastest application to date still took  days.ldquoThis needs to be looked at.Despite creating the legislation which gave rise to it, the Scottish Government said the Tribunal was an independent independent judicial body and the Lord President, as the head of the judiciary, was responsible for its operation.A spokesperson said: ldquoMinisters have taken signicant action to increase security and stability for those living in the private rented sector, including protection from unlawful eviction and wrongful terminations.ldquoWe recognise that rent arrears can be a serious concern for landlords and agree that landlords must be able to recover possession of their property when they follow the correct legal procedures for eviction.ldquoHowever, the Scottish Government considers it entirely appropriate that when seeking to evict someone from their home, this should be done following a fair judicial process."},{"url":null,"title":"councils-demand-fair-budget-snp","story":"In a campaign launched today, the council umbrella body Cosla warns more investment is needed in hard-pressed local services ldquobefore it is too late.It accuses SNP ministers of both skimping on their funding and burdening councils with nationally-directed duties.In , only  per cent of council spending was in lsquoprotected areasrsquo such as education and social work.Last year, more than % was in areas protected by central government, forcing councils to find savings in the other %.Cosla said that meant disproportionate cuts in roads, economic planning and culture and leisure.With another poundm ring-fenced in -, it said an extra poundbn of revenue and poundm of capital spending was vital.Cosla president Alison Evison said: ldquoIn recent budgets the Scottish Government has chosen to overlook the essential services that communities rely on day in, day out.ldquoIf we are to truly realise Scotlandrsquos potential then local authorities must receive a fair settlement.The Government said: ldquoThe failure of the UK Government to publish its budget at an earlier time means we do not have clarity on the funding available for our schools, hospitals and other vital public services.ldquoDespite this, we remain focused on introducing a Scottish budget for - at the earliest practical opportunity, and are in discussions with Cosla on how we can support their budget process.ldquoDespite further cuts to the Scottish Budget from the UK Government, we have ensured our partners in local government receive fair funding - delivering a funding package of pound.bn for all local authorities in  , which is a real terms increase of more than pound million.ldquoWhile ring-fenced funding is for increased investment in services such as our schools and nurseries, local authorities have complete autonomy to allocate over % - pound.bn - of the funding we provide, plus all locally raised income.ldquoDecisions on budget allocations for future years are subject to the outcome of the current negotiations with Cosla.ldquoThe results will be confirmed as part of the Budget in due course."},{"url":null,"title":"flights-delayed-plane-bursts-tyre-landing-glasgow-airport","story":"The \"technical issue\" left a runway blocked and forced at least one flight into a holding pattern.The airport fire service attended the plane and passengers disembarked once it was safe to do so.: Megxit means Megxit - its time to abolish the monarchyA spokesman for the airport said the runway has now been cleared.He added: \"An easyJet aircraft arriving from Malaga suffered a technical issue on landing.

It is  miles from Scotgoldrsquos site at Cononish near Tyndrum which is preparing to begin full-scale mining operations at what will be Scotlandrsquos first commercial gold mine.Earlier this year Scotgold also revealed soil samples from the hills of Glen Fyne close to the village of Cairndow had revealed ldquoexciting, new and potentially signicant results, with gold showing signs of being three times better than anticipated, and the silver almost twice as good.That area, which is said to be around two miles long, has been placed as a ldquohigh priority for further sampling with a view to eventually extracting the gold and silver reserves.The mine at Cononish produced gold for the first time in August  following the launch of an ore processing trial. Scotgold Resources has plans to re-open an old mine shaft and extract more than half a million tonnes of mineral ore, along with up to , tonnes of rock.Work will see a m tunnel dug as part of the initial exploration of the area expanded to stretch  metres deep into the hillside. The mine will then spiral m back up towards the surface.Itrsquos expected the mine will produce around , ounces of gold throughout its letime which, at current gold prices of pound an ounce, would place its value at over pound million. However, the actual value could be even higher once a premium is added for its rarity value.News of gold-digging operations has inspired a mini lsquogold rushrsquo among iniduals seeking glittering treasure in rivers and burns. Meanwhile earlier this month it emerged that a -carat doughnut-shaped nugget said to be worth pound, was found in a Scottish river in May.The gold, which weighs a total of .g, was found in an undisclosed river by a er using a method known as ldquosniping, using a snorkel and hand tools to scour the riverbed.The find came a year after the discovery of an .g nugget valued at pound,. The exact locations of both finds have not been revealed.The Loch Tay project area is said to cover ldquohighly prospective ground within the Grampian Gold Belt. The region of Dalradian rocks hosts several signicant minerals and deposits of high-grade gold, base metals and baryte and stretches from Northern Ireland and across Scotland.A search for gold is also underway at Curraghinalt gold mine in the Tyrone County of Northern Ireland.Erris Resources will operate and manage the exploration programme. Erris Resources chief executive Anton Du Plessis said the Loch Tay sites were \"highly prospective\".He said: \"This gives us exposure to new gold targets that have not previously been tested, but which are located in the highly prospective Grampian gold belt that already hosts some important gold deposits, such as Curraghinalt, and Cononish, which is only  kms away and that aims to pour its first gold next year.\"Importantly, land access agreements have already been signed, which allow work to proceed on the priority targets with the aim of advancing exploration to drill target definition in .Erris Resources has a portfolio of zinc and base metals projects in Ireland and gold projects in Scandinavia.The investment in the Loch Tay area followed a review of  samples collected by GreenOre taken from the site to the southwest of Aberfeldy and close to the Loch Tay Fault.The samples are said to have yielded lsquohigh-grade goldrsquo.A statement from Erris Resources added that the business ldquobelieves that the Loch Tay Project has signicant potential for discovery of an economic gold resource."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10894159.jpg?type=article-full","title":"kirsty-strickland-race-lead-scottish-tories-matters","story":"Uncharitable souls might ask why it matters.For all the overblown rhetoric about a so-called lsquorsquoTory revivalrsquorsquo in Scotland, whoever emerges victorious is unlikely to become our next first minister.Boris Johnson now has a hefty parliamentary majority won outside of Scotland and in spite of Scotland.

Letrsquos say for arguments sake that their Indyref counterparts comprise of Boris Johnson, Labourrsquos Keir Starmer and the LibDemrsquos Ed Davey. Could that trio really put the bitterness over Brexit to one side and uny in a simple pro-Union message If Better Together decided to get the band back together and wheel out their  squad, they would run the risk of appearing like they have nothing new to say on the Union and nobody new to say it on their behalf.Contrast that with the Yes movement, which has grown and organised itself into a strong campaigning force since . It has a wealth of new talent and experienced operators to draw from and, in Nicola Sturgeon, one of the most well-known politicians in the UK.Last weekend saw thousands of Yes supporters descend on Glasgow for a pro-independence march. The pouring rain did nothing to dampen their enthusiasm and the sight of the crowds dancing and cheering showed an energy that campaigners for the Union could scarcely dream of.:Mark Smith: If you canrsquot beat rsquoem, join rsquoem. What I learned from my first independence marchIn choosing their next leader, Scottish Conservative members are also nominating a spokesperson for their beloved Union. Given the utter chaos of the last few years, making the case for the continuation of the UK has never been more dficult. Which is perhaps why only two wannabe-leaders have thus far put themselves forward.Jackson Carlaw is the front-runner and has served as interim leader since Ruth Davidsonrsquos surprise departure. He is an agile politician and performs well at First Ministerrsquos Questions. He is tribal on the issue of independence but takes a more collaborative approach when it matters. His handling of the vaginal mesh scandal was impressive and when he became visibly emotional while raising the plight of the affected women, he looked sincere.Michelle Ballantyne is the partyrsquos social security spokeswoman at Holyrood and entered the race to ensure that members have a proper contest and not a \"coronation\" of odds-on favourite Jackson Carlaw. She is best known for a speech she gave defending the \"fairness\" of the two-child cap for tax credits, which her critics described at the time as \"Victorian moralising\".It will be for Scottish Tory members to decide which of the candidates will lead their party. Whoever they pick will also be tasked with helping to stop the disintegration of the UK.

People in Orkney will be shocked to hear how often those making emergency calls are being forced to wait due to a lack of land ambulance cover. In many instances, these will be cases where the response time can be critical.“This is absolutely no criticism of Orkney’s ambulance crews, who do outstanding work in operating a service that is clearly over-stretched. Indeed, the admission from the Minister about the scale of the problem shows that local crews are being let down by a lack of resources and support. This can only be making an already dficult job even more challenging.“I am due to meet senior representatives of the Scottish Ambulance Service early next month. I will make clear the need for an urgent review into the resources available locally and calling for additional capacity to meet the needs of the Orkney community. This is the very least that the public and our ambulance staff deserve.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But despite the growing impact of this crisis, there has been little meaningful action from the Scottish Government.“One strand of attracting talented doctors to the region will be ensuring that our medical schools are better linked to our communities. A medical school located within the Highlands and Islands has the potential to attract larger numbers of doctors to study here and then, when they’re qualied, to encourage them to stay and work in our region.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The  Holyrood election results are already in. Before a manestorsquos published or a single vote counted, we already know there will be no mandate for a second independence referendum. No matter how Scots vote, the result will be the same. No change.: Scottish Secretary rules out indyref evenSNP win  Holyrood majorityScottish Secretary Alister Jack was interviewed by a tenacious Gordon Brewer on Politics Scotland yesterday, ahead of Boris Johnsonrsquos expected rejection of Nicola Sturgeonrsquos Section  request this week. His comments would be astonishingdouble standards and democratic U-turns by top Tories were not so common and predictable.: Euan McColm: Shut broad church to get Labour Party backIndyrefEight short weeks ago, the MP for Dumfries and Galloway said an SNP victory in  would constitute a mandate for indyref. Now the Scottish Secretary insists he was just quoting former Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson and believes an SNP-only victory next year will mean nothing. Presumably a victory by the combined forces of the pro-independence SNP and Greens will mean hyper-nothing.So, too, will any defeat for the Scottish Tories while campaigning for the Union. Butcombined support for Union-supporting parties in  tops  per cent of votes cast, that will produce a compelling mandate for the status quo. What arrant hypocrisy. What nonsense. Unlike his predecessor, Jack doesnrsquot even bother with smoke and mirrors. His view ndash presumably Johnsonrsquos view ndash is that the ldquowinners of the last general election can now make it up as they go along. So henceforth independence-supporting voters can never ldquowin a Holyrood mandate and Union-supporting voters can never lose.Alister JackIn the eyes of Jack, democracy is a charade, the Scottish Parliament a talking shop and the future a foregone conclusion, settled in September . Forever. Thus, in , it wonrsquot matterScottish Conservatives are voted out of every seat and the SNP bags the lot. No election outcome will prompt any change in Westminsterrsquos attitude towards a second independence vote, nor will any result by the SNP constitute a mandate for anything. At least this breathtaking arrogance provides proof positive for anyone tempted by devo-max or federalism, that power devolved really is power retained by a bunch of millionaires and Old Etonians. So what does Jack offer Scots in place of the crazy notion that an election victory creates a mandate for action  A bit of old-fashioned wisdom. Sometimes itrsquos best to just wait and see. Wait and see how Johnson does, how the newly liberated, turbocharged ldquoindependent UK does outside nasty, restrictive old Europe and how much better le in the Union becomes with direct Westminster bungs to Scottish communities. After BrexitYes, wait and see how the Tories transform Britain after Brexit. Grumpy Scots will be wowed. You donrsquot have to be a born-again Yesser to spot the weaknesses in this wobbly and patronising proposition.First, Johnsonrsquos handling of Brexit is likely to be disastrous, not reassuringly impressive. The British economy has already taken a hit, with another likely after  January. Then follows a helter-skelter year culminating in a trade deal that will inevitably be worse than the one we already have ndash or a hard Brexit. The idea that Scotland will suddenly flourish in the midst of this economic storm is farcical ndash eventhe full extent of damage isnrsquot visible for years. Second, the desire for independence isnrsquot just a reaction to Brexit, and thus wonrsquot disappear evenle outside the EU miraculously proves to be a great success. For some, the cruelty of UK benefits has been the last straw for others, itrsquos the archaic nature of British institutions, the built-in elitism and inequality, the anti-migrant stance and the stunning ease with which devolved structures can be ignored and undermined when it suits Westminster politicians.None of this is likely to change as we ldquowait and see how le with Johnson pans out.Diminishing of democracyFinally, voters know that Tories talk a good game about democracy but are the first not to ldquodie in ditches when the going gets rough. A ldquoflexible thinker like Jack, who thinks nothing of contradicting himself in public over the mandate for indyref ndash is quite capable of contradicting himself all over again, should the need arise. And it will ariseJackrsquos shameful attempt to diminish the democratic process backfires and voters turn out in droves for next Mayrsquos ldquomeaningless Holyrood elections. The Tories, though, are not the only unionist party advocating ldquowait and see as some kind of alternative to indyref. UK Labour wants Scots to wait and seeits new leader creates the chance of victory at the next general election. Scottish Labour wants voters to hang on until they sort out federalism at an away day and persuade UK colleagues to endorse that policy, even though Gordon Brown failed with his Vow six years ago.Basically, the diagnosis from Jack et al seems to be that Scots are going through a wee phase that wersquoll grow out of when more sweeties are doled out or nicer people arrive. Is that really all the unionist parties have to offer As the weekendrsquos AUOB demo demonstrated, the idea of a very dferent Scotland is alive and kicking in the minds of many people. Not even predicted near-hurricane force winds daunted the bulk of marchers from attending or dampened spirits.The case for the Union, meanwhile, is being championed by politicians who would deny voters any democratic way to express their desire for change. Conservatives may think that lording it over the independence-supporting  per cent is an expression of strength. Therersquos a dferent way of looking at it ndash whatever obstacles are placed in their way, independence supporters are not getting fed-up, bought off, deflected or disheartened.So, while Britain transitions out of the EU this year, many Scots will be making their own unofficial transitions out of the UK, starting with widespread rejection of its stuck and arrogant mindset. Absolute inflexibility - democratic rigor mortis - signals the end of any organism. Jack may yet discover that a broken political union is no exception.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"how tories can win back scots who don t like boris brexit or both john mclellan","story":"Tories must learn from last month#s general election victory and the  disaster and focus on developing a winning strategy for next year#s Holyrood elections, rather than detailed policies which can turn into electoral poison, writes John McLellan.In a mood of mischief, I momentarily considered trying to test the Labour Party’s membership system to see whether I could get a vote in the leadership contest, but as Corbynism looks here to stay and it’s impossible to tell who is the worst candidate I quickly concluded there wasn’t any point.In any case, we’re not short of leadership campaigns in the Conservative Party and the process of finding a new Scottish boss is now likely to be a two-horse race between interim leader Jackson Carlaw and his Scottish Parliament colleague Michelle Ballantyne, the former Conservative group leader on Borders Council.Holyrood veteran Mr Carlaw is by some way the favourite, having led the party for the past six months, enjoyed a high TV profile in the General Election and visited the party associations during the campaign. But even before the election was called, Ms Ballantyne was getting around association meetings to raise her profile beyond the Borders in anticipation of a contest sooner or later. Her strong promise to the grassroots of more say to local associations has attracted plenty of support, including some of my Edinburgh Council colleagues, so a good contest is pretty much guaranteed.: The Conservatives have abandoned true conservatism for nationalism – Paris Gourtsoyannis: Alister Jack said he would fund breakaway Scottish Conservative PartyOf course, it’s all very well winning the contest, it’s what happens afterwards that matters and there is a very small window for the winner to settle in and produce a strategy that gives the party a realistic chance of overtaking the SNP as the biggest single party at the  Scottish elections. By the time the result is announced on February , there will be barely  months to go so realistically around seven months to prepare and agree a campaign.That process has been complicated by this week’s departure of strategy and communications chief Eddie Barnes, who planned to go shortly after Ruth Davidson’s decision to step down but agreed to stay on for the election campaign. The gap he leaves is not the only one from Ruth Davidson’s  high-point, with the previous departures of policy chief Marek Zemanic and the closest the Scottish Conservatives had to the left-field thinking power of Dominic Cummings, Kevin Ancell. So the new leader’s top priority is to assemble his or her version of that team, able to work effectively with whatever comes out of Mr Cummings’ Downing Street “weirdos and misfits” shake-up. Scottish party director Lord Mark McInnes and chairman Rab Forman have vital roles to play and both understand the political reality that the minute the contest is over the focus must be on the wider electorate, not party structures. Partly for this reason, it was accepted that turning Ruth Davidson’s succession into an argument about the Scottish party’s relationship with London would be disastrous. The membership is certainly anxious to be talking about new Conservative policies for the  campaign, an attractive, viable alternative programme for government, and for the  campaign not to rely solely on opposition to a second independence referendum.But the key lesson from the  triumph was the simplicity of the message and that campaign had learnt from the  disaster what look like detailed, credible and honest policies on paper can easily become electoral poison.There is more than enough in the SNP’s  years of government to attack without giving Nationalists the means to deflect criticism.We know from the  campaign in Scotland that those Conservatives who turned away did so because they didn’t like Boris Johnson or Brexit or both, but in a dferent context would . The context in  will indeed be dferent Brexit will be done and, like it or not, the election will be about a second independence referendum first and foremost, then the SNP’s record.Cynical though it may seem, details of what the new leader would like to dohe or she is First Minister come after understanding what it will take to win. And sticking to it.Downing Street’s pointless fight with Scottish PressAt a time of unprecedented political change and the perpetual turmoil of the digital communications revolution, the desire of the new UK Government to “slaughter sacred cows” is recognition that so many of the old ways of doing things are no longer suitable. In looking for places to start, Downing Street has chosen what it probably regarded as a soft target by switching the twice-daily official briefings for the Westminster Lobby correspondents from their offices above the Commons to  Downing Street.It’s not dficult to see why this wasn’t thought to be much of a problem because the list of registered Lobby journalists is dominated by heavy representation from the big news organisations  from the BBC alone,  from the , The Sun eight and even the weekly Spectator magazine lists three.Beyond Fleet Street, the Scottish Press is the best-represented group, with staff from this paper, the Herald, Daily Record, The Courier and the Aberdeen Press  Journal, but with only the one from each they will have to dash from the Commons to Downing Street, get through the security gate and into Number  and then the same in reverse to catch whatever business is going on in the House.It’s a needless inconvenience and a reasonable compromise of having the morning brief in Downing Street but the afternoon session kept in the Lobby has been mooted. With the Scottish election looming and a new Scottish leader to bed in, whatever holy cattle are headed for the abattoir, Downing Street shouldn’t pick pointless fights with the Scottish Press.Free trade or holidays Much of Scotland’s global reputation for being lovers of hard drink is based not just on the whisky business but on the bacchanalian revelry which surrounds Hogmanay, to the extent that two bank holidays are needed for the hangover while the rest of the UK gets by with one.But for the newspaper business, January  is a normal publishing day, bringing readers news of the celebrations, the New Year babies, previews of sports fixtures and such like and in the internet age that won’t change.But now it seems First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is set to back a campaign by the shop workers union Usdaw to ban bigger shops from opening on Ne’er Day which would all but wipe out hard copy sales which remain vital to an industry already under severe financial pressures.Labour MSP Jackie Baillie says it’s to allow retail staff to spend more time with their families, but it’s just another excuse for government to interfere with free trade.John McLellan is a Conservative councillor in Edinburgh©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"is a new leader enough for scottish conservatives to bounce back brian monteith","story":"After their success under Ruth Davidson, the Conservatives risk being easily demonised by rivals again, writes Brian Monteith.Just what can the Scottish Conservatives do to rescue themselves from an irresistibleto political irrelevance in Scotland  An election for a new leader of the party is at long last about to begin, but will that be enough toit to being the best hope to provide an alternative administration to the SNP Let us remind ourselves of a few salient facts.A look backIn the  general election when David Cameron managed to form a coalition government with Nick Clegg’s Liberal Democrats, the Scottish Conservatives – led by Annabel Goldie – managed to win only one seat on a vote share of . per cent. The following year in the Holyrood election, Goldie delivered the poorestScottish Conservative result ever, dropping from  MSPs to  on a constituency vote of . per cent and a list vote of . per cent.After a keenly contested leadership campaign, newcomer Ruth Davidson defeated Murdo Fraser, with Jackson Carlaw coming third and Margaret Mitchell fourth. Within five years, peak Tory at Holyrood was reached when the party won  MSPs on a constituency vote share of  per cent and a list vote share of . per cent.Peak Tory at Westminster was then reached in  when the Scottish party won  MPs with a vote share of . per cent. In last month’s general election the Scottish Tories slipped to  per cent, losing seven MPs that reduced them to only six seats.Davidsons appealIn my view the climb of the Scottish Conservatives from the doldrums to become the leading opposition party to the SNP was achieved primarily because Davidson offered a likeable personality that played against so many of the pejorative Tory stereotypes painted by her opponents – further, she was the most effective exponent of unionism against an SNP that would not respect the referendum result by focusing on the day job.The constitutional issue continues to both help and damage the Tories. While opposition to a second referendum had in the past been a huge vote winner, it appeared less of a threat in December as other parties majored on seeking to halt Brexit or talking up the threat of Boris Johnson.In England and Wales the fear of Jeremy Corbyn’s unpatriotic brand of socialism and his party’s betrayal over respecting Brexit squeezed Labour votes towards Johnson’s Tories. In contrast, many disenchanted Scottish Labour supporters loaned their votes to the SNP rather than Johnson’s Tories.IndependenceThe constitutional issue is not going away, so it will continue to benefit the Tories’ more robust defence of remaining British – but it also masks to the point of irrelevance the problems faced by Scotland’s public services and the SNP government’s culpability – suppressing the ability of Tories to make these a determining issue when it comes to all unionists casting a vote.Irrespective of what might happen at Westminster, it was always known that the next Holyrood election would be in May  the task for Davidson was to create a government-in-waiting.This would require the Scottish Conservatives to become the largest party so Davidson might be able to form a minority administration with a unionist coalition or, failing that, a comfort-and-supply arrangement from other unionist parties. One would expect that, as well as remaining the undisputed obstacle to a second independence referendum, the Scottish Tories would be able to craft attractive policies to improve the public services that have so obviously been in relative decline under the SNP.Unfortunately for the Scottish Conservatives, Davidson took her party down two blind alleys. Such was her opposition to leaving the European Union that she denied herself and her party any opportunity to capitalise after the referendum on the  per cent of Scottish support for leaving the EU. Further, and directly related to the former, she was too vocal in her opposition to the influence of Johnson in the party – so much so that, when the election to replace Theresa May arrived, she openly backed Savid Javid, then Michael Gove and finally Jeremy Hunt in a futile display of “anybody but Boris” that was little short of self-indulgent. Strategic errorsThese misjudgments had consequences, closing down lines of arguments about what the benefits of Brexit could be to Scotlandor making it dficult for Scottish Tories to embrace the undoubted optimism of Johnson’s campaigning style. Both were strategic errors that fed into the SNP’s narrative of demonising the Conservative government and undermining support for her party’s MPs.That these were self-evident problems for party campaigners was evidenced when Carlaw made peace with Johnson once he became the acting Scottish party leader after Davidson’s surprise resignation.In the aftermath of the general election, with the media focus now turning towards the Holyrood elections, we now have a Scottish Tory party that is highly vocal in criticising the SNP’s ample failings in office and preoccupation with independence but has failed in the last three years to develop any relevant policy offering that makes it an attractive alternative.Can we really expect either Carlaw or Michelle Ballantyne to repair the damage done by Davidson’s blind-spots and begin to offer a credible government in waiting By managing to detoxy the Tory brand, through the power of her own personality and remodelling it as a single-issue unionist party rather than a Conservative Party, Davidson led the Tories out of their pen and into new pastures. If they are not careful there is a danger that Carlaw and Ballantyne, both being of more traditional Tory stock, will allow the Scottish Conservatives to be rebranded by their opponents as the same old, same old, pre-Davidson Tories.Likewise they shall both face the problem Davidson would either not fully confront or could not solve – what policies can they offer that do not allow their opponents to unfairly demonise the party as heartless and uncaring or interested in only those who are already successful If the SNP is to be defeated it surely requires more than defending the Union, which should be a given. Scottish Conservatives must challenge the SNP on the weaknesses where the judgment will result in rejection.

It hasnt done our economy any good, were slower than the English economy, its not good for jobs.\"We do not think  is the time to start having more referendums, theyre very isive for our society and the time now is for us all to pull together and as one United Kingdom go forward and take on the benefits that exist.\"The SNPs shadow Scottish Secretary Mhairi Black hit back at Mr Jack, insisting that the Tories have no mandate to block a second referendum in Scotland.ldquoThe SNP won a landslide victory in last monthrsquos general election ndash winning % on a mandate for an independence referendum, while the Tories lost more than half their MPs,\" she said.ldquoI am confident that when the people of Scotland are given a choice on their future, they will choose to escape the mess of Brexit and the broken Westminster system to build a fairer Scotland.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"emergency services rush to glasgow airport after plane lands with a massive bang","story":"The \"technical issue\" left a runway blocked and forced at least one flight into a holding pattern. - Storm Brendan: Areas of Scotland to be affected by strong winds and floodingThe airport fire service attended the plane and passengers disembarked once it was safe to do so.A spokesman for the airport said the runway has now been cleared.He added: \"An easyJet aircraft arriving from Malaga suffered a technical issue on landing.

Though not the primary escape route, they are still an escape route in an emergency.“It’s a bit alarming to know that should there be an emergency, escape would’ve been delayed because of locked exits, and, depending on the emergency, could pose a real risk.”The Rail, Maritime and Transport union , which represents most Sleeper staff, said it had been informed.A spokesperson said: “RMT is fully aware of the problem and its serious nature. We are consulting with our reps on the Sleeper over both a solution and any further action required to ensure safe operation.”The Office of Rail and Road, which regulates safety, said: “Normally in an emergency situation, the safest place is inside the train, as the vehicle is designed to protect the passengers.“Should evacuation be necessary, the primary route is via the doors.“In an extreme situation, such as the vehicle being on its side, windows can be used.“Normally, windows are secured but not locked, and have sensors to noty the train managerthey are open.“On rare occasions, a  signal may be sent and the train manager is required to assesses the situation and may need to lock the window.“Windows are secured to prevent an open window fouling the path of trains on adjacent lines.”Ryan Flaherty, Serco’s managing director for Caledonian Sleeper said: “Clear processes and standards exists to assess and manage any risks so the safety of our guests and staff is not compromised.“The emergency windows have been designed, approved and risk assessed andthere is a fault with a window they can be locked until the problem is resolved.“As you would expect, guest and staff safety is always our number one priority and the new Caledonian Sleeper fleet is fully compliant with all mandated safety standards.

With the favourable weather it was a great day for the number of new first-time swimmers and in particular the young people taking part along with the usual stalwarts.With everyone back on terra firma and changed they made their way to the Bridge Inn to get fed and watered prior to the social festivities taking place. Chairman, Billy McIlroy, said it was “very pleasing” to see so many swimmers including young people on the events th year.Mementoes and certicates were presented by Mrs Sharon Smyth and Mrs Ann Ryan to the swimmers who had taken part on the day with all the swimmers being warmly applauded.After the presentations the Chairman again paid tribute to those who sponsored the swimmers this year as they have done for many years in the past.

The -year-old contract, which secured the services of Downpatrick footballer Jimmy Connor, is now the oldest artefact in the society’s museum.Signed on July , the document was for a season-long spell from September  of that year until April  in . However, Connor was also part of Belfast Celtic’s first league winning side of the - season.His highly decorated career would see him win virtually every trophy in Irish football, including a further league title with Glentoran and the inaugural Gold Cup in .The Belfast Celtic Society received the artefact from an anonymous donor, who found it in a pub in County Down.Speaking about the find, the society’s Chairman, Pádraig Coyle, said: “It means a huge amount to us.“The donor, when they did a bit of research and saw who this man was, they got in touch with the Society and askedwe would be interested in having them in the museum and of course we were delighted and very pleased that they are there. “It’s just another bit in the jigsaw of the story that is Belfast Celtic.”Signed by Belfast Celtic Secretary Robert Barr, the deal saw Connor receive a £ signing-on fee and  shillings per week. Mr Coyle said the fairly lucrative contract offers an insight into how well the club treated its players.“He was paid a fair wage then, and it’s interesting when you look at the document and see that when they were injured they still got paid provided they showed a doctor’s certicate,” he said,“It’s another reflection of how Belfast Celtic tried to look after its players in those days. Bear in mind that there wasn’t social security back then, there weren’t employers insurance arrangements, so it would’ve meant a lot to the guy thathe was hurt that his employers would look after him. I’m not surethat was common practice, but that’s how he was treated by Belfast Celtic.”Connor was seen as a particularly tough player, who would walk from Downpatrick to Belfast for training sessions, but for all his physical prowess and skill he was, given the time, relatively uneducated and simply signed his contract with an ‘X’.“It’s absolutely no reflection on him that maybe he wasn’t able to read or write, but how many people back then would’ve had access to education in the way that we do so now,” Mr Coyle explained.“What became the  Plus Act, the Education Act, wasn’t introduced until , so for many people having a basic education just wasn’t as easy,you lived in a rural area it was much more dficult.“I hadn’t seen a contract signed with an ‘X’ before I saw his contract. Of course, this was  years ago.”While the contract offers a fascinating insight into Belfast Celtic as a club, Mr Coyle said it contributes to the wider history of the city, particularly around St James’ and the Park Centre site where Celtic Park once sat.“It all helps to tell the story of that part of the city because at the time Jimmy Connor was playing for them they were the star attraction in that part of the area. People’s lives revolved around seeing Belfast Celtic midweek and on a Saturday. “The man who would’ve signed Jimmy Connor, his name is at the top of the contract, Robert Barr – he was a school teacher and he gave that up to become full-time secretary of Belfast Celtic Football Club. He worked for them until his death. There is a story there too. You’ll know St James’ and there’s a roadthat leads to Willowbank’s playing pitch and my surmising of it is that he lived in a house back in the day when there wouldn’t have been that road there, but he lived in a house, from what I’ve been told, that led into the Belfast Celtic ground. The story goes that he went out his back door in the morning, down that back garden and out a gate straight into Celtic Park.He added: “He would’ve been the guy who did all the administration for people like Jimmy Connor, who maybe couldn’t read or write, but he looked after them and made sure they were treated properly.”During his career Jimmy Connor was picked as an Irish international, receiving  caps during a -year spell when he played alongside other stars such as Mickey Hamill and Patrick O’Connell who, during a his managerial career, would save Catalan giants FC Barcelona from certain collapse.Sadly, Jimmy Connor’s le was cut short when he died in the Spanish Flu pandemic of , aged just .It is not knownJimmy Connor is survived by any family members, but Mr Coyle encouraged anyone with any information about him or Belfast Celtic to help keep the history alive by getting in touch.“Those of us associated with the Society are just volunteers who love the story and we’re happy in any way to help promote the story,” he enthused.“If people have anything they want to let us see or talk about then we’re more than willing.Anything at all to keep the story of the incredible football club going.”Jimmy Connor’s contract will go on display at the Belfast Celtic Society museum in the Park Centre."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"orange order says no to new decade new approach deal","story":"ORANGE Order leaders have fired a shot across the DUP bows with a no-holds-barred attack on the #New Decade, New Approach# deal tabled last night by the Irish and British governments.Previously, Order Grand Secretary Mervyn Gibson had warned the DUP that any concession on an Irish Language Act would be fiercely opposed by Orangemen.#In contrast to the detailed list of measures to promote the Irish language, references to Ulster-Scots Ulster-British culture are ambiguous # lacking meaningful detail or delivery mechanisms,# said a statement from the Grand Lodge of Ireland. #Indeed, many of the initiatives are merely reworking of previous undelivered commitments to our community. As British citizens living in the United Kingdom, we have a complex and multi-layered identity which in many areas is wider than simply Ulster-Scots. We remain unconvinced that the cultural traditions and identity of the Orange family will be meaningfully promoted or safeguarded by these proposal.#Earlier Conradh na Gaeilge had branded the proposals an #historic advancement# for the Irish language but ones which fell #far short# of previous government commitments by the Irish and British governments.The deal includes a number of provisions for the language including the appointment of a Irish Language Commissioner.Dr Niall Comer, President of Conradh na Gaeilge, said that deal was #undoubtedly historic#, however, the organisation highlighted the absence of an Irish Language Act as promised in the  St Andrew#s Agreement. #This legislation is undoubtedly an historic advancement for our community, and for those who wish to use the language, by providing historic official status, legal protection and an Irish language Commissioner for the first time in the history of the state,# Dr Comer said.#This has only come about as the result of a tireless, inspirational and bottom up campaign which has transformed how people here now view the language and ultimately how the state will interact with our community and shared language moving forward.#Ciarán Mac Giolla Bhéin of Conradh na Gaeilge added: #This protection comes in the form of an Irish language Bill being pasted into the GFA, independent from the other language legislation, as new, separate parts of that agreement. If passed, we will hold any new power-sharing executive fully to account on the full implementation of these proposals and will tirelessly test and expose the weaknesses and glaring omissions in the coming days, weeks and months. #There are some huge question marks here. These proposals fall far short of the commitments made in the  St Andrew’s Agreement, which promised an Irish language Act based on the Welsh legislation and does not contain provisions that are made for language in Wales or in the south, as was explicitly committed to by both Governments. #The complete omission of visibility and signage is hugely frustrating and will undoubtedly be a source of tension and will expose major fault-lines on contested cases of signage in the coming period. However, the possibility of the delivery of signage through language standards will be rigorously and immediately tested by our community. #The role and remit of the commissioner being left to the sign-off of OFMDFM leaves us at the whim of a veto being used against core components of the legislation and drafting and delivery of services. The use of any veto to limit, obstruct or frustrate delivery of services and rights would undoubtedly erode trust and could be potentially catastrophic for any incoming Executive.#We welcome the adoption of recommendations included in our consultation document for the centuries long overdue repeal of the final remaining  Penal Law, that will now facilitate the use of Irish in Courts the new central translations hub the right to use Irish in the Assembly, where it was previously sneered at and belittled, which includes a provision for simultaneous translation. Finally, the commitment to an Irish language Strategy has the potential to transform our community in the coming years. #We will now work diligently towards testing the glaring gaps in the legislation that prevent us from playing a fair and equal role in our society. Legal advice is being sought on several of the provisions, including the ‘official status’ provision. The devil is not only in the detail of the legislation, but in the implementation of that legislation.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"o theanga leipreachain go dti acht ghaeilge","story":"I , caitheadh amach as mo chéad chruinniú den Chomhairle i mBéal Feirste mé as Gaeilge a labhairt.Nó “teanga leipreacháin” mar bhaist Sammy Wilson uirthi.Mhuscail mé inniu agus Acht Ghaeilge ar an táirseach againn.Moill ró-fhada ach d’éirigh linn mar phobal Gaeilge ó Thuaidh tabhairt ar na húdaráis an tAcht a bhí geallta ó  a ghéillstin.Tá na heilimintí tábhachtacha atá de dhíth in aon Acht ansin:Stádas oigiúil.Coimisinéir Teanga.Caighdeáin seachas scéimeanna.Agus ar ndóighe tá ríméad ar leith orm go bhfuil aistriúchán comhuaineach le bheith curtha ar fáil sa Tionól féin agus comhaltaí ag caint Gaeilge.

And while there is a lull in December, we are blessed in that our weekends are the same all the year round.\"Weekdays are quieter, but we have found the quiet season has been getting shorter and there is something on in Portrush from Easter to October.\"The key to surviving is the ability to adapt to the winter to get you through the lean times, but we use the winter months to get ready for the summer season.\"A visit to Portrush conjures thoughts of sunny days, ice cream and fun day trips.On the day of our visit, though, a chilly breeze is coming off the sea. Whereas in summer people amble through the streets, today they are keen to escape the winter elements.For some, the dawn of a new year is bringing uncertainty.Despite having his own unique selling point of exquisite afternoon teas set in the most delightfully quaint tea shop, William McKittricks Panky Doos is at risk of closing.Summer  brought an unprecedented level of development to Portrush in preparation for The Open golf championship and with it road closures and ersions, which resulted in a drop in footfall.This, ahead of the dficult winter season, proved to be too much for Mr McKittrick and his we, who poured their savings into Panky Doos, leaving them with no choice but to put their business up for sale.He said: \"Last year the town was closed down for five months to redevelop it for The Open. \"Our business has become collateral damage because people stayed away because they couldnt get into the town.\"We caught up a bit over the summer but because the summer season was shorter we are now % down compared with the last three winters.\"Winter is a tough time but we have a niche in that we offer afternoon teas, and although I have lots of bookings for them, I am too far behind to keep going.\"This is breaking our heart, we would love to stay here. We knew coming into this that business is seasonal and for the first three winters things worked out great.\"In fact, even now I have bookings for over  afternoon teas that will take us right up to March, but unfortunately because of the impact of the development for The Open, we have been forced to put the business up for sale.\"Winter or summer, the leboat station in Portrush is ever ready. While the number of call-outs at this time will be fewer, when the calls do come their very nature brings challenges.Karl ONeill is a lead leguard superviser in Portrush and a volunteer RNLI leboat crew member. He said: \"Winter or summer we operate a -hour service, but in the wintertime our callouts tend to be commercial fishing vessels that have lost power and take a bit longer, we are out in a bit more swell, rougher seas.\"Portrush is very popular with local surfers, body-boarders and stand-up paddle boarders throughout the year, so it is not out of the ordinary for us to get calls to help people who have gotten into dficulties or injured themselves.\"Safety is paramount for our crews and we strap ourselves to our seats, but in the wintertime you definitely need a strong stomach because we can be out in very dficult conditions and at times we could be out for anything up to  hours.\"The personal protection equipment the RNLI provide is second to none so the cold temperatures dont tend to be a problem.\"I have been a volunteer for  years now, and to be honest when the pager goes off, evenit is cold and wet, I just get on with it.\"While the weather has a big impact on the day-to-day lives of traders and those working for the RNLI, local people out walking said winter brings a dferent vibe to Portrush, which isnt necessarily a bad thing.Among them are Edwina and Trevor Milliken, who visit Portrush two or three times a week during the winter.Edwina said: \"Portrush is beautul even in the winter and a great place to come to enjoy the fresh air and sea walks and the scenery is beautul.\"We walk right up to Ramore Head and back, which would be a good hours walk, but we call in for lunch in one of the many restaurants.\"James Marshall from Cullybackey has had a caravan in Portrush since  and takes full advantage of that, no matter what the season is.He said: \"Summers in Portrush are great and we wouldnt think of going anywhere . Our caravan looks out to the sea and that is a view that never gets boring, winter or summer.\"Summer is great but it is nice here in the winter too because it is a wee bit quieter, there is just something about Portrush that draws us here, no matter what time of the year.\"A few miles down the road in Portstewart, at the renowned Morellis ice-cream parlour restaurant, the huge queues that stretch out on to the street at the height of summer have disappeared as the temperature has dropped. Manager Amy Platt said: \"In the summer it is literally mayhem here, people are queued out the door and right up the street and that continues right up to  oclock at night.\"There are days we cant even see out to the street because there are so many people, so it is very dferent to how things are in the winter months.\"Our quiet time is getting shorter and shorter and I would say the season now runs from March or April right up to October.\"The two weeks before Christmas is the quietest time of the year for us but then theres Boxing Day, which is like a busy Saturday at the height of summer.\"I think by that stage people want to get out for a walk and they call in for an ice-cream and a coffee. January is another dead time for us, but thats always the way.\"Maureen McDowell is a lelong resident of Portstewart and, along with her friend Joy Cromie, has never lost the joy she feels walking along the promenade of her home town.She said: \"Portstewart is a great place no matter what time of the year, but I do prefer the buzz of the summertime. But the number of people coming here in the wintertime is growing and I think thats because of the number of coffee shops that have opened and stay open in the evening.\"It used to be in winter it was very dead, but thats changing.\""},{"url":null,"title":"labour leadership candidates criticise partys hustings locations","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Roman Catholic Bishop of Derry, Dr Donal McKeown, the Moderator of the Derry and Donegal Presbytery, Rev Colin McKibbin, and the Methodist Superintendent, Rev’d Richard Johnston, also took part.The Lord Lieutenant of the City of Londonderry, Dr Angela Garvey, Deputy Lieutenant Mrs Stella Burnside , former Lord Lieutenant for the County, Sir Denis Desmond, the Duke of Abercorn and the Deputy Mayor, Cllr Cara Hunter, were in the congregation. Also present were Lord Hay of Ballyore, Dame Mary Peters, former PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Peter Sheridan, East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell, Sinn Feacutein MEP Martina Anderson, former SDLP leader Mark Durkan, Mrs Pat Hume, former Church of Ireland Primate Most Rev’d Alan Harper and the Bishop of Mahajanga in Madagascar, Rt Rev’d Hall Speers. The Archbishop of Armagh, Most Rev’d Richard Clarke, was unable to attend in person and Bishop Andrew Forster read out a tribute from Dr Clarke in which he described Bishop Mehaffey as “a powerful influence for good”. “Of course, we all have our own inidual memories of Jim,” the Archbishop said, “but all of us will recall with particular admiration his work – in company with Bishop Edward Daly – not only for peace but also for reconciliation in this city. “Together they brought hope and light into communities where there was precious little of either. We all saw in Bishop Jim a gracious composure coupled with a steely resolve – the sense that this work for peace and harmony between communities so long ided was work for the Kingdom of God, and it would not be thwarted, from whatever quarter.” googletag.cmd.push HallmarkThe address in the Service was delivered by the Rt Rev’d The Lord Eames, another former Primate of the Church of Ireland, who recalled Dr Mehaffey’s advice to colleagues on the Church of Ireland’s Priorities Committee to remember why they were there. “If there is a hallmark as he moved to this city to be your Bishop,” Lord Eames said, “ there is a hallmark that I would have as part of his legacy, it is those words: ‘Hold on, you’ve lost sight of why we’re here.’ You’ve lost sight that the reconciliation in our community which was so fostered by Edward Daly and James Mehaffey must never be lost sight of. “You’ve lost sight of the wonderful rewards of reconciliation or in reaching out hands of friendship. And within the Church, you’ve lost sight at times of your roots – the roots that have given you the commission of God to be alive for all sorts and conditions of people.“For Bishop Jim, this was his priority as he worked with Edward and other leaders to bind up the broken, to heal the wounds of the lost, to make people remember why you’re here, that in the short gt of a lespan you must grasp every opportunity to do things for the good of all – across the barriers, across the river and across the isions.“This was his ministry as a Bishop. It was a ministry exercised in those dark days of suffering, misunderstanding, suspicion and it was a ministry which was being true to the commission given to him in September : ‘Hold up the weak, heal the sick, bind up the broken, bring again the outcasts, seek the lost.’”Before the Service, Bishop Mehaffey’s we, Thelma, their daughter Wendy and son Tim welcomed the many hundreds of people from across the community who had come to sympathise with the family in their loss. And Wendy read out an emotional tribute to her father, during which she spoke of her love and gratitude to her “beautul dad”.She said her father’s love of people came into its own after he was appointed Bishop, as he sought friendships across the city. There was challenge in this role, Wendy said, but he remained steadfast in his belief and faith. “During his last spell in hospital,” she said, “there was a day when, in a moment of brilliant and characteristic clarity, Dad said: ‘One helps the other.’ May that be the profound message that we each take away from our gathering today.”Bishop Mehaffey’s remains will repose in St Columb’s Cathedral until Monday morning when they will be taken to Belfast for cremation. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Roman Catholic Bishop of Derry, Dr Donal McKeown, the Moderator of the Derry and Donegal Presbytery, Rev Colin McKibbin, and the Methodist Superintendent, Rev’d Richard Johnston, also took part.The Lord Lieutenant of the City of Londonderry, Dr Angela Garvey, Deputy Lieutenant Mrs Stella Burnside , former Lord Lieutenant for the County, Sir Denis Desmond, the Duke of Abercorn and the Deputy Mayor, Cllr Cara Hunter, were in the congregation. Also present were Lord Hay of Ballyore, Dame Mary Peters, former PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Peter Sheridan, East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell, Sinn Feacutein MEP Martina Anderson, former SDLP leader Mark Durkan, Mrs Pat Hume, former Church of Ireland Primate Most Rev’d Alan Harper and the Bishop of Mahajanga in Madagascar, Rt Rev’d Hall Speers. The Archbishop of Armagh, Most Rev’d Richard Clarke, was unable to attend in person and Bishop Andrew Forster read out a tribute from Dr Clarke in which he described Bishop Mehaffey as “a powerful influence for good”. “Of course, we all have our own inidual memories of Jim,” the Archbishop said, “but all of us will recall with particular admiration his work – in company with Bishop Edward Daly – not only for peace but also for reconciliation in this city. “Together they brought hope and light into communities where there was precious little of either. We all saw in Bishop Jim a gracious composure coupled with a steely resolve – the sense that this work for peace and harmony between communities so long ided was work for the Kingdom of God, and it would not be thwarted, from whatever quarter.” googletag.cmd.push HallmarkThe address in the Service was delivered by the Rt Rev’d The Lord Eames, another former Primate of the Church of Ireland, who recalled Dr Mehaffey’s advice to colleagues on the Church of Ireland’s Priorities Committee to remember why they were there. “If there is a hallmark as he moved to this city to be your Bishop,” Lord Eames said, “ there is a hallmark that I would have as part of his legacy, it is those words: ‘Hold on, you’ve lost sight of why we’re here.’ You’ve lost sight that the reconciliation in our community which was so fostered by Edward Daly and James Mehaffey must never be lost sight of. “You’ve lost sight of the wonderful rewards of reconciliation or in reaching out hands of friendship. And within the Church, you’ve lost sight at times of your roots – the roots that have given you the commission of God to be alive for all sorts and conditions of people.“For Bishop Jim, this was his priority as he worked with Edward and other leaders to bind up the broken, to heal the wounds of the lost, to make people remember why you’re here, that in the short gt of a lespan you must grasp every opportunity to do things for the good of all – across the barriers, across the river and across the isions.“This was his ministry as a Bishop. It was a ministry exercised in those dark days of suffering, misunderstanding, suspicion and it was a ministry which was being true to the commission given to him in September : ‘Hold up the weak, heal the sick, bind up the broken, bring again the outcasts, seek the lost.’”Before the Service, Bishop Mehaffey’s we, Thelma, their daughter Wendy and son Tim welcomed the many hundreds of people from across the community who had come to sympathise with the family in their loss. And Wendy read out an emotional tribute to her father, during which she spoke of her love and gratitude to her “beautul dad”.She said her father’s love of people came into its own after he was appointed Bishop, as he sought friendships across the city. There was challenge in this role, Wendy said, but he remained steadfast in his belief and faith. “During his last spell in hospital,” she said, “there was a day when, in a moment of brilliant and characteristic clarity, Dad said: ‘One helps the other.’ May that be the profound message that we each take away from our gathering today.”Bishop Mehaffey’s remains will repose in St Columb’s Cathedral until Monday morning when they will be taken to Belfast for cremation. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Its strategic plan centres around funding for the Greater Belfast Development with no mention of its Magee or Coleraine campuses which have witnessed student numbers drop signicantly in the past five years. The University’s most recent Financial Statement for  , outlines its long-term financial strategy. UU’s five-year strategic plan ‘Five and Fty’ sets the vision and mission of the University. It states: “As Northern Ireland’s civic university, Ulster University will deliver outstanding research and teaching that encourages the innovation, leadership and vision needed to help our community thrive.” googletag.cmd.push It details ambitions to deliver an “operating surplus” to support a sustainable investment strategy in both the University’s physical resources and information technology facilities. This includes the generation of “sufficient cash reserves” to allow for the allocation of poundm per annum to capital projects of which poundm per annum is towards the Greater Belfast Development and the repayment of loans to fund this project. A spokesperson for the Derry University Group has urged UU to immediately hand over its lands to city-region, saying: UU is demonstrating all the hallmarks of a struggling multi-national business running down a neglected outpost. Ulster needs to hand over the lands and budgets at Magee to the city-region immediately to allow us to develop university provision here autonomously. Ultimately, we can sit and watch UU die slowly in the regions while it moves to Belfast, or we can take proper control of the situation ourselves and start building for the future, with a vengeance. googletag.cmd.push The idea of Council partnering in a multi-million pounds development City Deal with organisation such as UU is frankly ludicrous. Imagine you were about to invest poundm and performed due diligence on your partners and found out they had UUs record. You would leave the table immediately. Council must do likewise. Signicant problems The University’s approved financial strategy aimed to ensure the financial viability of UU. Any borrowings were not to exceed that approved in the Business Plan for the Greater Belfast Development and any other projects that may arise which are confirmed as self-funding. The strategy also aimed to support the development of activities that generate income for growth. However, since the   financial statement was published the Northern Ireland Audit Office released a report showing that the Greater Belfast Development has encountered signicant problems, and delays, meaning it now needs to attract substantial additional external finance to bridge a major funding gap. It is anticipated to run poundm over budget. The business case, approved in March , envisaged that the expanded Belfast Campus would be open to students in September  at a cost of pound million. Funding was to come mainly from the UU’s own reserves and external borrowing, with the Department for the Economycontributing poundm capital grant. UU has earmarked cash reserves of poundm built up since , to support the project and committed a further pound million over the next three years. This is over and above the pound.m spent by UU to date. The total cost of the project is now estimated at pound.m including  per cent VAT which is irrecoverable.

Since the event local groups and organisations have been coming up with ideas and applying to the fund for support.MJM Group was delighted with the response with group chairman Brian McConville saying: “We have been involved in the Ballykelly community since we bought the site in . This now brings our local contributions to close to pound,. The aim of this event was to open the site up to local people and provide a family fun day out but it is also to raise money for specic activities that will make a dference. We hope to build on this event for next year and get to know even more people in the local community.”The fund will allow Tiny Le to deliver a free five-week baby massage course for parents with premature babies. It will help fund sensory equipment for the residents in Rush Hall Nursing Home. Glack Community Association provided most of the volunteers during the event and they will receive money towards purchasing new Youth Club equipment and towards a new container to store it in.

Philip ODoherty has increased the managers budget signicantly, by %, ahead of this season, and the manager admitted his delight at having that extra support ahead of what he and the fans hope will be a successful season. “The budget is key, absolutely, but at the same time Shamrock Rovers probably had one of the biggest budgets in the league last year, they won the FAI Cup and they continue to get better.“Of course, as a manager, you want a few extra pound to spend but we’ve got to strive both on and off the pitch to get this place better.“When you have the backing of a chairman who loves the place, that’s key to the whole process. In my opinion there wouldn’t be a Derry City Football Club without Philip O’Doherty because of his business sense and his investment over the years has been invaluable.“He rescued the club when it went out of business. He’s not just a guy who is throwing money at the football club, he’s a man who cares for the city. He cares for the people in the city. He’s a very proud Derry man andwe all took a leaf out of Philip O’Doherty’s book we’d be in a very good place.“He cares and backs it up. He invests in people and structures and employs a lot of people in the city. I, for one, hold him in the highest esteem for what he does for the people of Derry and for the football club. It should never be taken for granted.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The result is Belfast: City of Light, a new book in which she shares her experiences and asks some pertinent questions on matters of faith and beliefs.Bronagh began her journey as a non-churchgoer. Now, she says she is a dferent person.ldquoI did not set out to go on this journey or write this book, but simply started to follow an artistic thread like many artists over the centuries before me, she remarked. ldquoThe thread became so compelling and extraordinary that I eventually felt destined to write it down.Born in Newtownards in  to Frances and Paddy Lawson, who had ed to Belfast to oversee the design and building of the Ulster Museum, Bronagh spent her first two years on the Upper Newtownards Road in Belfast with her three older sisters, before moving to Portaferry in  and later to Strangford.Educated at Down High School, in  she attended art college in Bristol and then gained a first class degree in textiles fashion at Winchester School of Art, Hampshire. Moving to London on graduation, she won a Fulbright scholarship and attended Parsons School of Design in New York.Bronagh sometimes visited Northern Ireland and despaired. Prior to the end of the Troubles she spent time as a participant on ious cross-community development programmes before deciding to use her creativity in a dferent way.For  years she set up and ran cross-border, cross-community development programmes mostly within the enterprise sector in interfaceareas of Belfast. At the same time she explored her own upbringing during the Troubles and heard many stories from people in Belfast of experience she only saw on TV growing up and often switched off in horror.She spent three years based in North Belfast, between the republican New Lodge and loyalist Tigers Bay areas. Walking into work one day she collapsed. She had become incapable of processing the traumas that people living in some of most deprived areas of Europe were enduring on a daily basis.She found herself coming back to her original training as an artist and started a journey towards her own healing by going to church.Bronagh says she asked herself a lot of questions as she attended Protestant and Catholic services in Belfast and beyond.She says: ldquoWhatinstead of listening to the continuous repeated stories of Protestant vs Catholic in Belfast, an inidual had first-hand experience of visiting every church in the city for a service, simply looking and listening when going to each one ldquoWhat would they see and hear  As a non-church goer starting out on this journey, how would you feel ten years later  What is going on in churches in contemporary Belfast  How might this open-minded curiosity inform the continuous shting conversation about the city that I call home Belfast: City of Light costs pound and is available online at lulu.

I am guided by the principles of the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie also recalled the words of the very early th century Irish political thinker, AE Russell, who said: ldquoThe strength of Irish culture lies, I believe, in plurality rather than unormity.The view that national culture is a guarantor of homogeneous identity is no longer tenable. A living culture follows a multiplicity of voices. Authentic culture is not a matter of ourselves alone. Baroness Ritchie said that running alongside the Good Friday Agreement, Russellrsquos words are the embodiment of her political philosophy mdash partnership, working together, respect for political and ethnic dference and unity in ersity.She then focused on the Queenrsquos speech, issuing a reminder that it dealt with a plethora of issues, with Brexit, the environment, National Health Service, climate change and devolved Institutions chief among them.ldquoOf these, Brexit has been one of the greatest political catalysts in Britain and Ireland, said Baroness Ritchie.ldquoIt has consumed all aspects of our lives in Northern Ireland since the referendum of June  where the people voted to remain in the EU. It has impacted on identity, sovereignty and nationality.ldquoLike the majority in Northern Ireland I want to remain in the EU and realise that due to the Governmentrsquos majority in this parliament we will leave the one institution that has provided so much political, social and economic stability on the island of lreland.Baroness Ritchie argued that EU membership had diluted territorial and mind borders and contributed much to reconciliation and developing the economy and infrastructure, urging the British government to look at how this can be achieved in any new working arrangements.ldquoBrexit has undermined the principles of the Good Friday Agreement in relation to reconciliation and building a shared society, the maiden speech continued.ldquoIt has deepened political isions at a time when our political institutions were collapsed. Being a concept that is essentially about the economy it has become a major constitutional issue in Northern Ireland.ldquoMoreover, the EU Withdrawal Bill, which will give effect to Brexit, will have direct consequences for trade between Britain and Ireland and between Northern Ireland and Britain. It will also reduce parliamentary accountability and lessen protections for workersrsquo rights.Baroness Ritchie said people do not want borders either in Ireland or in the Irish Sea. She insisted they want to build reconciliation, intra community political progress, economic and social regeneration and social justice,the very factors she explained that were enhanced by EU membership and which could be damaged when the UK leaves.She continued: ldquoWe need the closest possible links with the EU. We need favourable trading terms with the EU and as a cautionary warning to the government, there canrsquot be zero trade details with the EU and then do our own thing. Borders and bureaucracy need to be lessened and a comprehensive trade agreement with the EU is required.ldquoThere is a need for access to the biggest market in Britain which takes half of our agricultural food sales from Northern Ireland which is equivalent of pound.bn. Coming from an area where there are two fishing ports, the fishing industry is looking for the current unhindered and unfettered access to itrsquos main market in Britain to continue.

This means that the temporary ban is set to remain in place.At Monday nightrsquos meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council, politicians discussed the detail of a letter from NI Water which detailed that the organisation has identied a requirement in the region of around pound.bn to maintain safe, clean drinking water and address main issues with sewer networks between  and .The news comes after NI Water revealed recently that during this period, an additional poundm investment will be required across the council area.While politicians are concerned about the poor waste water infrastructure in ious parts of the district, the need for investment in Saintfield is viewed as a key priority by many concerned atthe current moratorium on new-build schemes.The lack of investment in the districtrsquos sewerage infrastructure is being blamed on years of underinvestment in the system and the failure to upgrade networks of pipes installed decades ago which are struggling to cope with demand.Rowallane councillors Terry Andrews and Billy Walker say the situation in Saintfield needs to be addressed as a matter or urgency.Cllr Andrews described the detail of the NI Water letter as ldquoparticularly worrying and said the scale of the investment is unlikely to be made available by the government.ldquoThe current housing ban and the need to upgrade Saintfieldrsquos sewerage network is impacting on a signicant number of people and has ramications for the construction industry and buildersrsquo suppliers, he added.Cllr Walker said there were ldquoserious issues in Saintfield with the moratorium on new-build having an impact. He said the sewerage network needs an upgrade and this must be carried out as soon as possible.ldquoIn the past, raw sewage has been back flowing into peoplersquos toilets and spewing out from underneath manhole covers into gardens. Such a situation is intolerable. The current system cannot cope.Cllr Walker said the problem was not with the townrsquos sewage treatment plant but the pipes which supply it, explaining that suggested level of investment required to tackle the problem is in the region of poundm.He added: ldquoPeoplersquos lives in Saintfield are being made a misery. In the first instance, the poundm needed for the town must be found. If we donrsquot get satisfaction from NI Water at the end of the month and the Assembly is not sitting, we need to go directly to a direct rule minister.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke said NI Water was making it clear that it did not have the budget to carry out the required work and blamed austerity measures on cuts to public services.ldquoI hope the Assembly will be up and running and we have a local minister in place and that there will be the required cash injection. The ban on new development does have an impact, particularly on the construction industry. The reduction on the block grant also isnrsquot helping.Independent councillor Jarlath Tinnelly said no big decisions were ever taken locally, but ldquokicked down the road forever and a day because political parties are afraid to make them.He added: ldquoThere is a day of reckoning coming for all public services and I remember reading years ago that the introduction of water charges would sort out the infrastructure problem.ldquoI am certainly not advocating that course, but the point is that these big decisions are pushed further along for someone  to deal with.

A minute later at the opposite end Jason Noade got on the end of a McGrattan corner, but headed over.It looked asRathfriland were going to take their - lead into the break as the game entered the th minute and good value they were for their lead.However, with  minutes gone Stefan Mason exploded into le. The rangy striker took on two Rathfriland defenders after picking up a long ball out of defence.He headed down the left flank and looked destined for the by-line, but stopped in his tracks, checked back, turned his markers and curled a lsquoworldyrsquo into the top corner of the net, giving Parr no chance.Two minutes later it was - Olympic and again Mason was involved. When his attempted cross was blocked, McGrattan headed the ball into Nathan Jonesrsquo path.Nothing looked on when Jones got the ball centrally, just inside the box, but he managed to get the ball from under his feet and beat Parr all ends up with a stunning finish and turn the game on its head.The second half was every bit as competitive, but Olympic seemed to have the measure of Rathfriland and were playing well within themselves until Peter Telford was given the freedom of the box and allowed to head in a Lockhart free kick to make it - in the rd minute.Jason Noade then headed a Jones free kick at lsquokeeper Parr and with  minutes played the busy McGrattan fired over after a nice build-up.Another searing run and cross from Fitzpatrick begged to be put away, but Rathfriland lacked a fox in the box and the chance was gone.Chances continued to be created at either end and with the respective lsquokeepers earning their corn with brilliant saves.However, the game was in the nd minute when Walsh came to Olympicrsquos rescue when he somehow kept out an effort from Marty Havern when the former Glenavon striker seemed certain to win the game for Rathfriland. Two periods of extra-time came and went before the dreaded penalty shoot-out took centre stage.Jones, Stevie and Jason Noade, McGrattan, Tate and James McClean netted for Olympic with Kilmartin, Johnny Roy, Nigel Prentice, Ruari Cunningham and Daryll Evans replying for Rathfriland before Walsh saved the day when he beat away Fitzpatrickrsquos penalty.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Paul Dickson, Jason Noade, Anton McGrattan, Nathan Jones, Stevie Noade, Chris McNamara, Stefan Mason, Conor Reid, Ryan Molloy.

But they feel very strongly about this issue and are prepared to sacrice a dayrsquos pay to make their point. It is important to remember that the ongoing strike is not just about pay parity, it is also about safe staffing levels.Mr McConnell said NHS workers have watched staff leave ious aspects of the service and not be replaced which has left the provision of health and social services at ldquocrisis point with all services affected.He said staff have tended to keep their heads down to deliver services, explaining that they are now saying ldquoenough is enough.The Unison officials said while their members continue to go the extra mile for patients, this is impacting on their physical, emotional and psychological health.Mrs Ritchie added: ldquoStaff family lives are being affected and they have simply had enough, especially as they are being paid thousands of pounds less a year than their counterparts across the water.Mr McConnell added: ldquoThe bottom line is that the goodwill of staff has come to an end.

A section of DUP members believe that Mrs Foster’s leadership has been disastrous for unionism and a third of Sinn Fein ard fheis delegates recently voted to remove Ms O’Neill.Therefore, they are more constrained in their ability to make the sort of magnanimous gestures necessary to persuade the other side that they are genuine about reaching out and working together.Even their compromise has done little to convince each other’s supporters. Mrs Foster’s concessions on the Irish language have been made grudgingly while Sinn Fein’s Mary Lou McDonald said on Friday that she did not even accept some elements of the deal which involve more Britishness, claiming that they were some form of side deal between the DUP and the NIO.In their comments on Saturday, Stormont’s new leaders tried to reach out, aware that this new Executive will only surviveit exists on a wide base of public support. Both leaders, whose tone is often disastrous when heard from the other side of the ide, spoke with the sort of optimism which has become foreign to Northern Irish politics over the last three years.On their side they have many of the public wearied by three years without a government and willing them to make it work. But it will be dficult for this pair to so swtly move from years of rancour and convince even their own voters that this is a new dawn.With the DUP and Sinn Fein having been confronted with the implications of their past secrecy, rule-breaking and in some cases law-breaking, it is possible that they have genuinely repented and will operate to higher standards.In defence of that hypothesis, the new deal involves some reforms – such as a strengthened requirement for civil servants to take minutes of meetings – whichimplemented will curb the room for bad behaviour.Prime Minister Boris Johnson in Belfast to meet Arlene Foster and Michelle O’NeillDeal toStormont is a ‘beachhead’ to Irish unity, says Declan Kearney of Sinn Fein Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"But in the last Stormont many of the worst practices involved simply ignoring rules, while officials looked the other way. In part, that was because civil servants, in some cases for the noblest of reasons, wanted devolution to work and believed that bending the rules to help their political masters may help the process.Amid the relief at the restoration of Stormont, it is easy to see how civil servants and others could be tempted to sweep uncomfortable truths under the rugthey think they might destabilise the new regime.Yet it is now clear that such short-term willingness to accept indefensible behaviour allowed that behaviour to flourish to the extent that it toppled not inidual ministers or spads but the entire edice of Stormont.It is therefore striking that there will now be less internal scrutiny of the Stormont system than at the point when it fell over the cash for ash scandal. The decisions of the UUP, SDLP and Alliance to re-enter the Executive means that there are now only five of the  MLAs who are not members of governing parties.That restricts the potential for flaws to be spotted at an earlier stage. On Saturday that point was made by a minister in the last Executive, independent MLA Claire Sugden.Although as a former minister she had faced the discomfort of facing an opposition in the Assembly chamber, she said: “Opposition improves legislation. If policy cannot [face] the challenge which other members provide to it, then it’s not good policy and no one benefits from that.”In , the creation of the first official opposition at Stormont since  breathed le into the Assembly, forcing ministers to treat it with respect rather than as a rubber stamp, and sharpening scrutiny of the notoriously secretive Executive.Without that in place, and with the public now aware through the RHI scandal of the grisly innards of past Executives, there is a danger that the entire Stormont system will now be seen as unable to hold itself to account.While that might be more comfortable for the DUP and Sinn Fein in the short term, it would ultimately be strategically damaging for the whole idea of devolution.try catch  TrendingNI snow alert -

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

PRESS ASSOCIATION Photo. Picture date: Saturday November , . See PA story IRISH SinnFein. Photo credit should read: Brian Lawless PA WireThe order’s comments came after an interview by Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald where she was asked about the matter.“The Orange Institution is not interested in engaging in ‘conversations’ or responding to hypothetical statements which merely assist Sinn Fein and nationalists as they continue to ‘talk up’ the inevitability of a united Ireland,” an Orange spokesman said.“Orangemen in many communities across Ireland have experienced Republicanism’s intolerance and hatred first-hand. Ironically, despite these comments, recent developments in the Republic of Ireland have shown us the reality that Sinn Fein and others are not really interested in equality – or the historical commemoration of anything deemed to be British.”Ms McDonald had told the Irish Independent she was willing to put celebrating the Twelfth of July across the island of Ireland on the table in talks about a future Border poll.She said “everything should be on the table” when asked specically about annual celebration.“I’ll tell you how we do it, we do it by having them [unionists] front and centre in the conversation and asking them, because I would be absolutely astonishedfor people of a unionist persuasion the issue around the Twelfth of July was not raised,” she said.“We, more than any other political party in the Oireachtas, are used to working with, living with, dealing with our unionist neighbours and the Twelfth of July is very widely celebrated.”Ms McDonald’s comments were made before the current controversy over the now-postponed Irish state commemoration of the Royal Irish Constabulary and Dublin politan Police. Sinn Féin led calls for the event to be cancelled altogether amid concerns it amounts to celebrating the Black and Tans.While acknowledging Sinn Féin supporters may not favour marking the Twelfth, Ms McDonald believes people will “surprise themselves” with what they find acceptable in a united Ireland.“Generally speaking, people are decent and reasonable and they want a good le for themselves and for their families and they are happy to accommodate and respect their neighbours so long as that accommodation and respect comes back to them,” she said. “They’re kind of the go-to issues when people talk about Irish unity, and that’s fine. Bring all of that to the table. Let’s talk about it.”While critics claim she is not in control and Sinn Féin is still run out of west Belfast, the paper said, she insisted Gerry Adams “doesn’t pull my strings, nobody’s pulling my strings”.Ms McDonald also declined to express regret for proclaiming “up the rebels” and “tiocfaidh ár lá” when she took over as leader. “No,” she said when asked about using militant Republican language. “Up the rebels.”LBC journalist and NI man Matthew Thompson tweeted: “That’s nice and all. But you’d think allowing unionists one day of the year to celebrate their heritage would be the least they might expect from a united Ireland.”In  former Sinn Fein TD Peadar Toibin said he was not sure the time was right for southern Orangemen to parade in their capital, saying there is “a broken relationship” with the order which needs work to be fixed.TUV Councillor Matthew Armstrong said the Orange community would treat the offer “with the contempt its deserves”.\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"portadown businessman sam hewitt enjoyed colourful life well lived ","story":"Car crashes into NI homeShops get drop in rates but pubs see a large spikeNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPortadown businessman Sam Hewitt enjoyed a colourful le well-livedWhen Sam Hewitt ran the Superglaze firm in Bridge Street, Portadown, everyone knew him as ‘Super Sam’.By The NewsroomWednesday, th January , : pmUpdated Wednesday, th January , : pm\"Sam Hewitt as drawn by Billy Austin.And that is how he will be remembered as hundreds of his friends mourn his passing.Sam died in Craigavon Hospital on Sunday afternoon after a brief illness and as family and friends reflect on a colourful le well-lived they will all remember Sam with much affection.Sam was  and he and his we, Margaret, lived at Annahugh House, Kilmore, one of the oldest houses in County Armagh. Sam, the third child of Norman and Jean Hewitt,was raised on a farm at Moneypennys and it was there thathis love for the outdoor le was nurtured. He would often recall his early days there, telling stories of sailing to Portadown along the canal on his canoe and spending hours in the fields observing the wildle along the river banks. It was there too that his spirit of adventure developed which ultimately led to a career in the Royal Air Force and a posting to Germany where he served for three years, developing a love for that country. That career was relived when the family gave him a trip in a Spitfire for his th birthday and Sam was delighted when the trip was featured on Anne Marie McAleese’s Radio Ulster programme Your Place and Mine. Having obtained a pilot’s licence earlier in le he enjoyed lots of flying time from Aldergrove and there were frequent trips to the Isle of Man with his we, Margaret, and daughter Claire.As a child and teenager Sam developed a close relationship with local horse dealers, the Hamill family, and this gave him the opportunity to ride horses, which became a le-long passion, passed on to daughter Claire and grandchildren Olivia and Rocco.Family was the most important aspect of Sam’s le and he and Margaret had three children, Claire, born in , Reuben in i and Samuel in . He was totally devoted to them, opening up opportunities for each ofthem to pursue a range of activities ranging from horse-riding to fishing and motor bikes and all sorts of watersports. And although Samuel was based in England there was nothing he enjoyed more than to arrive at Annahugh House and see his children play with the model trains Sam had so lovingly built.Because of his love for horses Sam was involved in the founding of the Armagh Horse and Pony Club and instigated pony camps for children in the Mourne Mountains. Until recently he wasa constant supporter of grandchildren Robin, Alex and Jude at rugby and cricket. Sam’s career was as colourful as his le. On leaving the Air Force he worked at Quintin Castle in Portaferry as the land steward where he continued his horse riding and began to sail and fish in Strangford Lough. Then he was a car salesman with Allens Automart, where he formed a lasting friendship with the owner, George Allen, and John Ford he dabbled for a while as a carpet salesman with Cyril Lord’s Carpets, then there was a spell as a paint salesman in Bridge Street before he went into business on his own with the Superglaze business in Meadow Lane. And all the while Sam’s infectious enthusiasm for whatever he did warmed him to everyone with whom he came in contact, forming a close relationship with the late Victor Locke who had emigrated to Hong Kong. Debonair Sam was an immaculate dresser and had a wardrobe to fit every occasion, whether it was a wedding, a funeral, a formal invitation or a sporting occasion and he stood out from a crowd with his sleek, silver hair.He was also a car enthusiast, his interest having been fostered at Allen’s Automart and he cut a dash as he enjoyed top-range sports cars over the years. Travel was another of his passions and he had been to Vietnam, Africa, America, where he toured the Grand Canyon, Thailand, Hong Kong andChina  But Sam will be best remembered for his friendship and there have been many tributes to him. He enjoyed his weeklylunch date with a group of friends, a get-together that been going on for some  years and one of that gathering, Ron Mullen, said, “Sam was a one-off. He was a wonderful friend and he always had the ability to brighten any gathering, no matter the circumstances. He will be sadly missed.”Retired school headmaster Jim Smart’s friendship with Sam goes back over  years and Jim said, “Sam was a frequent visitor to our house in Mandeville Street where my father ran a potato business. My mother always had the teapot on and we enjoyed seeing Sam arrive and giving us a bit of the fun that was part of his character.”Sam brought fun no matter where he went but he had his serious side too and his RAF training in discipline and decorum could come into play when the occasion demanded.

Even local churches will see a hike in rates with some payments rising by almost %.Meanwhile at least one bank will have their rates reduced by more than % and will pay £k per year less.Many shops in Market Street have had their rates slashed substantially, some by as much as %. A kiosk in High Street Mall will have its annual rates reduced by half.There doesn’t appear to be any change to the rates at the Meadows Shopping Centre while Rushmere Shopping Centre will see a rise of almost %.At least one outlet in Magowan Buildings will have a rates rise of almost % though others will see no change. ASDA will benefit from a drop in rates from £,, to £, - a drop of £k. Tesco Extra in Craigavon will see a % drop in its bill from £,, to £,, - a decrease of £kBucking the trend in the hospitality sector is the Seagoe Hotel which sees no change to its rateable value.The Omniplex Cinema in Craigavon will see the rates rise by almost % from £k to £k.Portadown Fire Station will also see a rates hike of almost % but Cascades Leisure Centre next door, which is due to close, will see a % drop in rates.Portadown Health Centre will see a drop of almost % in rates in April down from £, to £, - a drop of £,.Mr Farrell said: “I think this is a step in the right direction but I have concerns about the rise in rates in the hospitality sector.”He added that there needed to be a ‘radical reform’ of the ‘flawed rates system’ and called for online retailers to contribute to the rates system.In total draft valuations for all , businesses in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area have been published online.Known as Reval – this process will result in a new non-domestic Valuation List being used to calculate business rate bills from April . The Department of Finance said: “This process is about restoring fairness in the rating system by redistributing basically the same rating burden using more up-to-date values. A revaluation is not about collecting more money from businesses, but it is about ensuring that everyone pays their fair share.” Business rates are charged on most non-domestic premises including shops, offices, warehouses, factories, hotels and pubs as well as utilities such as gas, water, electricity and wind farms.The results show a modest growth in the total value in the Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council area of .% compared to the current Valuation List which is based on  values. Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary at Department of Finance said: “The revaluation means that from April, ratepayers will contribute to the funding of essential public services such as health, education and infrastructure as well as a wide range of council services relative to their  rental value, instead of  values as at present.“The growth in the total value of the Valuation List does not translate into a corresponding overall increase in rate bills. I will be seeking to ensure that the regional business rate poundage that we set is lowered to reflect the overall growth in the Valuation List. I will also be encouraging councils to do the same in respect of district rate poundages reflecting the fact that revaluation is not about raising more revenue overall from rates.”If rate poundages are adjusted downwards by both central government and district councilsthis would mean up to % of business ratepayers would either see a reduction or little or no change in their rate bill.Encouraging business ratepayers to view the draft schedule of values, Sue added: “I’m delighted that for the first time we are making the draft valuation list available on our Spatial NI . This will provide ratepayers with greater detail including a breakdown of how their value has been calculated as well as seeing the same information for similar properties in their local area and indeed for all similar properties across Northern Ireland. This approach makes the rating system much more transparent – which is absolutely the right thing to do.“I would encourage business ratepayers to go online and view the new draft values for their properties ahead of rate bills issuing in April.”Preliminary outcomes of the revaluation include:a modest growth in the total value in Northern Ireland of .% many high street shops and some shopping centres will see a decrease in rateable value, with some as much as %many of the edge of town retail parks will remain constant some of the largest food stores show a decrease in rateable value of between % and %the office sector shows an overall increase in rateable value of % andthe pub trade will see considerable iation in values with notable decreases in some pubs and signicant increases in some pubs in busy urban areas.As well as being able to view their new valuation online at a time that suits them, business owners can come along and talk to the Reval team at events across Northern Ireland to find out more about what their new valuation means for them.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business urging cross party political backing to restore assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community is urging cross-party political backing for a deal which could see the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.
