The rest of the things were just be careful.\u0027But they were very emphatic about not giving any information to the press or talking to them, because it just encourages them more. So none the less, that\u0027s what I tried to do.\u0027Despite these conversations however, allegations later surfaced that he had staged photographs with the paparazzi.Footage obtained by The Mail on Sunday showed the 73-year-old former lighting director arriving at an internet cafe with photographer Jeff Rayner.‘It was presented to me as a chance to change my image because for the last year photographs of me were always derogatory,’ he told Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid.‘They would take pictures of me with my hand on a beer, taking the bins out, buying a toilet and making a big deal of it and it all made me look negative.‘I didn’t do it for money, I did it to change my image. For one whole year I was presented as a hermit hiding in Mexico but obviously I made a mistake and it all went wrong.I spoke to them both and I apologised. I realised it was a serious mistake but it’s hard to take it back but again it was to improve my look, I had been seen negatively for an entire year.’   On Prince Charles…\u0027I\u0027m a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history\u0027: Thomas Markle\u0027s regret at not giving Meghan away as he says he was jealous but thankful \u0027handsome\u0027 Prince Charles stepped in          Prince Charles took Meghan Markle to the altar in the absence of her father and symbolically had entered St George\u0027s Chapel alone Mr Markle thanked Prince Charles for stepping in on the big day and giving his daughter away, but added that he was \u0027jealous\u0027 as he watched from the US.Calling the prince \u0027handsome\u0027, he said he could not think of anyone better to walk his daughter down the aisle in his absence.Mr Markle told Good Morning Britain: \u0027It might have been a treat for him as well because he has never had a daughter.\u0027I was honoured. I can’t think of a better replacement then Mr Charles. He looked very handsome. I was jealous, I wish it was me but thank God he was there.\u0027He said he still had not met Prince Charles or spoken to him on the phone but that he looked forward to \u0027thanking him\u0027 when he eventually met the royal face to face.Mr Markle\u0027s absence from the wedding shocked Meghan and was so last minute that his name was still in the Order of Service on the day.He said: \u0027She was beautiful. I cried a little watching her. I was very proud and I couldn\u0027t see a better moment in my life.

Right now they\u0027ve earnt the right to go away on a honeymoon.\u0027Going forward I would certainly love to meet the Queen. I\u0027ve had respect for that woman since I was a child.\u0027I think she\u0027s one of the most incredible women in the world and I\u0027d love to meet her.He said that Harry and Meghan offered to come and visit him after the wedding, but he told them it was \u0027a bad idea as the press would eat them alive\u0027.Speaking about his health and travelling abroad in the future, he added: \u0027I\u0027m on the mend and I\u0027m feeling much better. Doctors are making me lose weight and take care of myself so I\u0027ll be ready to go.\u0027  On becoming a grandfather…\u0027She\u0027s wanted children for a long time\u0027: Thomas Markle talks grandchildren as he says a child \u0027will be in the making soon\u0027 for Harry and MeghanMr Markle said that he expects his daughter and Harry will want to try for children soon.He told the programme: ‘She\u0027s wanted children for a long time and when she met Harry and she spoke about how much she loves him, there\u0027s got to be a child in the making, somewhere soon.’Mr Markle said: ‘As long as they\u0027re happy and they have a great life and have some beautiful children and do good things in the world, I can\u0027t ask for more.’  On pulling out of the royal wedding…Meghan\u0027s father reveals she cried when he told her he couldn\u0027t make royal wedding because of a heart attack as he says both she and Harry told him to \u0027take care\u0027          Mr Markle watched the moment the couple married from a sofa in a Californian B\u0026ampB, he revealed todayThomas Markle Snr choked back tears as he reflected on the royal wedding and revealed how he had planned to attend the big day until he was forced to pull out at the eleventh hour.He broke the news to Meghan about his absence in an emotional phone call just days before she was due to walk down the aisle in Windsor Castle\u0027s St George\u0027s Chapel.He said: ‘They were disappointed. Meghan cried, I\u0027m sure, and they both said: “Take care of yourself, we are really worried about you”.’He added: ‘I was very proud. I was very upset that it wasn\u0027t me (walking her down the aisle) but the whole world was watching my daughter.

I don’t have to, that’s my daughter.\u0027He also spoke about Meghan\u0027s upbringing, and how he and his ex-wife Doria were determined to not let their break-up affect their child.He said: \u0027We didn\u0027t express anger towards each other so she never felt that. Doria and I have always had a good relationship and she felt loved, there wasn’t a problem with that ever.\u0027Doria and I get along and we talk. I still bring her flowers every mother\u0027s day. We’ve always had a good relationship around our daughter and between the two of us.

The 73-year-old (pictured on GMB) described his sorrow about pulling out just three days before he was due to walk his daughter down the aisle because of heart surgery and admitted he was jealous but grateful that Prince Charles stepped inBut after my lengthy interview with him today, conducted with my GMB co-host Susanna Reid, I’ve changed my mind about this rather shy, gentle man whose life was irrevocably changed forever when Meghan fell in love with Harry.First, he fully acknowledged his own reckless stupidity in staging those pictures.‘I realize it was a serious mistake,’ he said. ‘It’s hard to take it back.’Second, it’s almost impossible to comprehend the tsunami of attention that cascaded on the poor guy’s head from the second the engagement was formally announced.His account of how he discovered the identity of Meghan’s new man was both comical and endearing: ‘The first phone calls were, “Daddy, I have a new boyfriend.” And I said, “That’s really nice.” And the next call was like, “He’s British,” and I said, ‘That’s really nice.” And eventually the third time around was like, “He’s a prince.” And at that point, she said, ‘It’s Harry.” And I said, ‘Oh, Harry, OK!’    Markle fully acknowledged his own reckless stupidity in staging pictures in an internet cafeFor a man eking out a quiet retirement of considerable solitude in a remote part of Mexico, this would prove to be a spectacularly inconvenient revelation, though he is far too proud of his daughter to admit it.To their shame, senior Palace officials didn’t immediately put someone on a plane to take care of Thomas Markle.One burly, wily ex Household Cavalry guard sitting outside Mr Markle’s front door all day - and none of the chaos that followed may have happened. Or why not just fly him to London a month early – it’s not like Kensington Palace doesn’t have enough bedrooms?Surely both Harry and Meghan must have known he’d be subjected to intense media scrutiny? Yet they did nothing to help him, leaving the former Hollywood lighting director to face the cameras himself for the first time like the proverbial rabbit in headlights.  Mr Markle revealed that his daughter (pictured together above) cried when he told her that he wasn\u0027t coming to London          Harry and his bride are seen on their wedding day as they leave St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor CastleI still find this failure to protect him incomprehensible, just as I find it weird that Meghan’s mother Doria had to go to the wedding entirely alone, that Harry STILL hasn’t met his father-in-law, that Meghan STILL hasn’t visited her father since his heart attack, and that Prince Charles has had NO contact with Thomas Markle despite taking his daughter down the aisle.But hey, all families are a bit weird – right?I believe Thomas when he says his motivation to do the staged photos was more about improving his dishevelled image than money.(Just as I believe his motivation for appearing on Good Morning Britain today for his first ever TV interview was more about setting the record straight than the relatively small fee we paid him.)There had been a steady flow of pictures of him looking like an overweight, unshaven, beer-swilling vagrant. Who wouldn’t be tempted to try to create a more positive ‘look’ for themselves in the run-up to starring in the biggest wedding of the year?I also believe him when he says he only wants the best for Meghan and Harry. Thomas Markle strikes me as a man who genuinely loves his daughter, and thinks Harry’s the really lucky one to have landed his ‘little Princess’.Marks \u0026 Meghan! The Duchess of Sussex teamed her £4K Oscar...\u0027Promise me you\u0027ll never raise your hand to my daughter\u0027:...\u0027I\u0027m a footnote in one of the greatest moments in history\u0027:...Share this articleOf course, there will be some who think he should have kept his mouth shut, just as I did in the run-up to the wedding.But that was then, and this is now.After all the feverish speculation, rumour and gossip surrounding the chaotic furore of that week, it was good to hear the truth from the horse’s mouth – told in a soft, thoughtful manner that most of our viewers seemed to find endearing and sincere.The Palace, which had no prior knowledge of our interview, will have gone into spasms of horror that Thomas revealed Harry’s views on Donald Trump and Britain’s decision to leave the European Union.After all, the royals are trained to never give their political opinions about anything.But Harry’s views – according to Thomas, he’s ‘open to the Brexit experiment’ and thinks President Trump should be ‘given a chance’ - seem more diplomatic than especially controversial.If I were the Palace, and Meghan and Harry for that matter, I would bite my tongue and try to see Thomas Markle’s interview in the way he intended it to be: a candid, honest account of what it’s been like to live through the blazing firestorm of life as a first time father-of-a-royal-bride.    Thomas Markle said he was \u0027honoured\u0027 that the Prince of Wales took on the job of walking Meghan down the aisle insteadNone of us is perfect, and none of us would survive such intense scrutiny unscathed or without doing a few silly things along the way.I don’t doubt Thomas’s sincerity when he says he did what he thought was the right thing at the time.It wasn’t, and as he freely admits now, he’ll now have to live with that for the rest of his life.But any man who, as Thomas Markle does, travels to Los Angeles each year to place flowers on his ex wife Doria’s doorstep on Mother’s Day is not a bad man.In fact, after today’s interview, I’ve come to the conclusion he’s a thoroughly honourable, decent man who is understandably struggling to make sense of a crazy new existence that was entirely of someone else’s making - albeit someone he loves very dearly.He’s also having to do it with barely any support.I congratulate him on his courageous candour today, and wish him well with his recovery.As for his future as a royal father-in-law, I simply say this: good luck Thomas – you’ll need it!"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/14/4D5C0CF100000578-0-image-a-10_1529329982999.jpg","title":"Prince Charles joins Queen annual Garter Day service Windsor Castle","story":"Share this articleLook charming in prints like Sophie in a dress by Emilia WicksteadShop the current collection at MATCHESFASHION.COMIt\u0026#39s been a busy few months for the Royal Family.

She has been working at the Department for Education for eight months.In April 2016, Miss McDermott posted a picture of herself inside No 10 on Instagram, captioned: ‘My office for the day. My job is better than yours.’The former model, who lives with her parents in Essex, attended The Coopers’ Company and Coborn School, a well-performing academy in Upminster, east London, and gained two As and a B at A-level.Arriving on the ITV2 show in Majorca, she told her fellow contestants she ‘works in the government’.          The former model, who lives with her parents in Essex, attended The Coopers’ Company and Coborn School, a well-performing academy in Upminster, east London, and gained two As and a B at A-levelWhen asked if she was responsible for making laws, she replied ‘yeah, in essence’. She is appearing on the show after being granted an unpaid career break by the DfE in line with civil service rules, which state civil servants can have a career break of between three months and two years.It is thought DfE bosses might not necessarily have known she wanted the break in order to appear on Love Island.While the show’s controversial nature may raise eyebrows among Miss McDermott’s employers, her mother Karen insisted she was proud of her. Speaking about her ‘very academic’ daughter, Mrs McDermott, 56, added: ‘We’re behind her 100 per cent. She obviously spoke to us when she was first talking to the show and said she wouldn’t do it if we didn’t want her to.‘We told her to enjoy it and have the best experience of her life. We hope she finds her man.’ She said daughter ‘loves her job’ and is ‘passionate about making a difference’.

Mr Markle (pictured with his daughter) exposed some of his daughter Meghan and Prince Harry\u0027s most intimate secrets          To be wrong-footed once as they were when the duchess\u0027s father announced he would not be giving Meghan away may be unfortunate. Pictured, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle kiss on their wedding    In his interview on ITV\u0027s Good Morning Britain, Mr Markle spoke of his telephone conversations with Harry to Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid (pictured)Four weeks ago, old royal hands were left wondering why more effort hadn\u0027t been taken to ensure that Meghan\u0027s father was properly brought into his daughter\u0027s new world.Instead, aides were left floundering when it emerged that Mr Markle had foolishly participated in the staging of paparazzi pictures. The irony was that this act of invading his own privacy came at the very time Kensington Palace was sending strict warnings to the media not to harass him.It was hard to escape the conclusion that royal advisers had failed to realise that this lonely man — who lives in a run-down, Mexican border town — would struggle to deal with the enormity of his daughter marrying into the Royal Family.Why, they were asked, hadn\u0027t Mr Markle been helped? A consular official from the British embassy in Mexico City could have been sent up to brief him or even one of Prince Charles\u0027s more experienced aides flown out to acclimatise him.Yesterday, as they did a month ago, sources murmured that offers of assistance had been made to the former TV lighting director. Aides were reluctant to say more, but many thought that as soon as the wedding was over steps would have been taken to ensure Mr Markle felt he was part of the family.          Meghan Markle\u0027s mother Doria Ragland (left, with Prince Charles and Camilla) received the warmest of welcomes when she flew in from her LA home for the weddingThis might mean a new home, paid for by his wealthy son-in-law, and with an income to support himself and where he would have no need to give interviews for cash. At the very least one might have expected the newly-weds to have visited him by now – or arranged for him to visit them. His treatment – or rather a lack of it – contrasts wildly with that extended to his ex-wife and Meghan\u0027s mother, Doria Ragland. RICHARD KAY: Bouquet of her favourite forget-me-nots, flash of her dazzling aquamarine ring but most tantalising of all... was empty seat at the royal wedding REALLY for Diana?The boyfriend Meghan would rather forget: How a 22-year-old Miss Markle dated an award winning PORN STAR among a host of other young suitorsHow Prince Louis is named after a colossus of the empire cruelly cut down by the IRA who was implicated in a military plot to overthrow Labour PM Harold Wilson and whose wife was a voracious sexual adventurousRICHARD KAY: Charles still hasn’t seen the newborn prince because he has a difficult relationship with William RICHARD KAY asks the tantalising question: Will Kate copy the Queen with baby No 4? RICHARD KAY: The touching rituals that reveal just how much the Queen loved her corgis...they\u0027re buried at her favourite homes, each with a headstone on which she leaves posies of flowers. Now it will be the same for Willow, the last of her doggy dynastyRICHARD KAY: Why has Prince Charles snubbed his sons and entrusted his charities to David Linley? How Meghan Markle is transforming the Royal Family, by RICHARD KAY: Kate, Camilla and Diana all had to wait... but Harry\u0027s fiancée is the first unmarried partner to have Christmas lunch with the QueenCecil Parkinson\u0027s daughter is found dead after \u0027suicide\u0027 at 57: Loss of the father she adored \u0027finally overwhelmed ex-Tory minister\u0027s tortured child\u0027 The 61-year-old yoga teacher received the warmest of welcomes when she flew in from her LA home for the wedding. An aide was waiting to drive her to Kensington Palace she had tea with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall and, ahead of the wedding, met the Queen.She is now firmly part of her daughter\u0027s new family. Thomas Markle, thus far, seems to be excluded from it. One can only imagine how frustrating this must be for Prince Harry. Determined to protect his wife in the way he was never able to protect his late mother, Diana, the response of the Palace to Meghan\u0027s father has fallen short.Of one thing we can be sure: he will not be overly embarrassed that his views on Trump and the EU have emerged. One figure who has known the prince since he was a boy, says: \u0027You could say he handled a tricky conversation well. When asked about Brexit he was trying to be non-committal and on Trump he didn\u0027t want to be rude.\u0027A less generous view was being taken elsewhere however. As a young man whose experiences of America come from his time training with the US military and that ill-fated trip to Las Vegas, he might be disposed to thinking positively about Trump.Indeed the royals have followed Trump\u0027s rise closely. At a charity lunch before the 2016 US election, Prince Charles asked an American sitting next to him what Trump was like.    Mr Markle\u0027s assertions about Harry\u0027s views on Donald Trump and Brexit were explosive          Ever since Trump (pictured) became US President, the royals have been scrupulous to avoid revealing any views on the matterThe guest later admitted she was flustered because she didn\u0027t think royals talked about political figures. Perhaps this accounts for the sympathy that exists at Clarence House for this latest imbroglio involving Meghan\u0027s father.\u0027Prince Charles and Camilla like Meghan enormously, but they do feel that the team around her and Harry is rather inexperienced,\u0027 says an insider.Others, though, feel that the duchess herself could have done more to avoid difficulties. It is worth recalling that according to Meghan\u0027s biographer Andrew Morton, the former actress has long become used to compartmentalising her life.When success with TV series Suits arrived, she purged many childhood friends. Some might argue she has done the same with her close family. Her mother, after all, was the solitary representative of blood relatives at her daughter\u0027s wedding. Inevitably, those around the royals were comparing Mr Markle with another royal-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s father Michael Middleton.He has only ever spoken once – and then under strict Palace control – when his daughter became engaged to Prince William. In the near eight years since, he has said nothing.Sadly – with a little more due diligence – this Markle debacle Part 2 might have been wholly avoided. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/19/19/4D6B711800000578-5859259-image-a-38_1529434459557.jpg","title":"City slaves entered US apologize slavery","story":"    A 1861 engraving shows a family being auctioned in Charleston          Slaves return from South Carolina cotton fields in a photograph from around 1860Charleston Council member William Dudley Gregorie insists the resolution will be more than just a soon-forgotten vote.

It is believed that the Canadian was able to perform his bizarre feat due to an anomaly in his tear gland  Brunhilde and Elsa Van Droysen were billed as two giant German \u0027sisters\u0027 although they were not actually related. The shorter of the two was born Dora Herms in 1888 in Berlin, and often appeared in shows as \u0027Brunhilde\u0027. She married William Van Droysen in 1918, made her way to the US and starred in the legendary Barnum and Bailey circus in 1922. Meanwhile, the other \u0027sister\u0027 - Annie Haase - was born in 1906, also in Berlin. She joined her fellow giantess in 1926 and toured as \u0027Elsie and Hilda - the Van Droysen Sisters\u0027.

When he was captured in 1944, he was labelled the \u0027biggest Nazi\u0027. After the war, he actually made America his home - where he signed up as the world\u0027s biggest Father Christmas. In 1959, he starred in Ripley\u0027s Believe It Or Not on Broadway.

She was fitted with a \u0027bow chaser\u0027 gun that was mounted in the middle of her fore deck. For service during the First World War she had her bow chaser removed, and her gun mount transferred to the fore peak, according to National Historic Ships UK          Above: how the gunboat looked before the restoration work began in 2017. Mr French said large sections of the vessel were rotten from where she had been left exposed to the wind and rain for nearly two decades in the boatyardDuring the restoration, Mr French found 32 bullet holes in its hull from where it had been riddled with Turkish machine gun fire while grounding on the beach at Gallipoli. Years after the Boer War had ended, Caretta was re-assigned to the naval fleet, in 1915, due to her expendability, and sent to the Dardanelles to assist in the landing of troops, according to National Historic Ships UK.She had her bow chaser (mounted cannon) removed and her gun mount was moved to the fore peak (front end of the hold).Caretta was then fitted with a Maxim machine gun to give her a higher rate of firepower and allow her to cover troops landing on the beaches at Gallipoli. A photograph from the time is believed to show Caretta at Anzac Cove, with her twin funnels noticeable in the picture. Her gun mount is still on board today and is situated under the galley worktop.The vessel went on to serve during the Second World War and it is believed she was seized by the Admiralty for use in Operation Dynamo (the 1940 evacuation from Dunkirk), with her masts removed prior to departure.   The forward cabin at the time of Dunkirk, above. Caretta was launched in 1898 at Devonport Dockyard, part of a new breed of small armed boats that were designed to protect the fleet at anchor and allow armed patrols.

Although the vessel has been given a pre-sale estimate of £60,000, the vendors have been told it could go for almost three times that because of her remarkable history.It would represent a huge profit for Mr French, an aircraft engineer, and his 32-year-old wife, who are from Ryde on the Isle of Wight.Mr French, 39, said: \u0027We had been looking to buy a little classic boat as a restoration project.\u0027I saw Caretta on eBay, it was a chance find. The advert didn\u0027t list all of her history, it just said she was a bit old and a bit special.          Unique 120-year old roll of honour. She has been recorded on the National Register of Historic Vessels since 2009.

It is believed she was seized by the admiralty for use in Operation Dynamo and her masts were removed prior to departure\u0027We jumped in a bit head first and bought it from the photos. She would never have seen the light of day again otherwise.\u0027It was only later that we discovered her true history. I couldn\u0027t believe my luck as she is a true one-off. There can\u0027t be that many ships that served in three different wars that are still floating today..\u0027The Caretta was launched in 1898 as a small armed boat designed to protect British battleships and cruisers at anchor.          The bow still had bullet scars from the beaches of Gallipoli. In 1915, the gunboat was assigned to the fleet and sent to the Dardanelles for the landing of troops. She had her bow chaser removed and her gun mount was moved to the fore peak. She was then fitted with a Maxim machine gun to give her a higher rate of firepower and allow her to cover troops landing on the beaches at Gallipoli          Owner Arron French said large sections of the vessel were rotten from where it had been left exposed to the wind and rain for nearly two decades in the boatyard.

She didn’t appear to have any other medical or psychiatric illness … She just did not appear to be a psychiatrically troubled person at all. ‘She had children, she had a normal family – and so I remember, when the priest said to me: “Dr Gallagher, that’s what I thought, but we wanted to make sure that we checked her out medically,” I said, “Well, Father, you know I’m pretty sceptical.” And he said, “That’s the type of person we wanted.”‘So then he continued to send me things he and his colleague, who was an ex-Marine, who had also become a prominent exorcist … I actually became very good friends with them. They’re both deceased now, but I miss them terribly.’Before that first case – and his relationship with exorcists and the demonic world – he says he was unaware of the intricacies of possession and oppression.He grew up a devout Catholic, one of five children born to an Irish-American lawyer and his homemaker wife. Dr Gallagher attended weekly Mass with his family and studied at renowned Catholic high school Regis in New York City before being accepted to Princeton.‘I didn’t know what I wanted to be,’ he says. ‘I probably wanted to become a lawyer, a professor or something. I did like helping people, you know – so when I was at Princeton I had a number of roommates who were pre-med, and I just got interested, intrigued by the idea of becoming a doctor. And I’ve also read a lot in my life, so I got interested in psychoanalytic ideas, and it just kind of dawned on me that helping people, as well as becoming a professor, would be interesting if I did it as a professor of psychiatry. So that’s what I decided to do.’He laughs: ‘I’m the black sheep who became a psychiatrist in an Irish Catholic family.’Following Princeton, he played semi-professional basketball in France and taught English at a French high school. Then he trained as a resident in psychiatry at the Yale University School of Medicine, and he is currently on the faculty at New York Medical College and Columbia University Psychoanalytic Institute for Training and Research.  It was as his career progressed, however, that his acquaintance with the world of evil spirits intensified. He says he’s seen about four cases a year, though he’s heard of hundreds more, especially at meetings of the Europe-based International Association of Exorcists.He mentions the case of another US housewife, though he does not specify her location. This woman – he gives her the pseudonym of Catherine - ‘as a teenager had dabbled in satanic rituals, and she had kind of promised herself, in some fairly foolish way, to evil spirits,’ he says. ‘She did a few grisly things, which I’m not going to go into, but she also, with a couple of friends, they did minor satanic rituals and she became possessed.            Ferrer Bassa (1290-1346) painted this work showing St Bernard of Clairvaux exorcising someone possessed the Catholic Church has a strict set of criteria for determining demonic possession - which can afflict any culture, age, race or religion, Dr Gallagher says          Dr Gallagher, pictured during his days at Princeton, where he was a Classics major before he pursued a career in psychiatry‘She was certainly violent when the evil spirit took over, and she had a variety of signs of possession. It took multiple, multiple people to hold her down during exorcism.’He adds: ‘She had a very odd symptom, which is similar to a case in the gospels, where she selectively couldn’t hear certain things … If you said to her: “Catherine, did you go to the store today?” Shey’d say “yes.” “What’d you buy?” “Meat and potatoes.” If you said, “Catherine, did you go to church today?” She would say, “What?” “Catherine, did you go to church or did you pray today?” “Did I what?”‘Her sense of hearing was blocked. So we had the bright idea – I was with a fellow psychiatrist, we were assessing her – and we had the bright idea, why don’t we write it on a piece of paper?‘So we wrote it on a piece of paper: What did you do this morning? And she said, “Well, I drove the car to the gas station, I had to fill up the gas tank.” “Catherine, did you pray today? Did you go to church?” and hold it up on a piece of paper.‘Do you know what she said to me? She said, “Dr Gallagher, why are you doing this?” I said, “What do you mean?” “Why are you showing me a blank piece of paper?”’‘Now the obvious motive there was to prevent her from being able to talk about anything spiritual, get the help that she needed, get the solace and spiritual support she needed.’The evil spirits take hold of people, he says, because they truly hate God and humans.‘We have the ability to love and turn to God they don’t. They made their choices, and they hate the image of God in human beings,’ he says. ‘They truly seem to hate human beings. I mean, not only do they want to destroy us spiritually, alienate us from God, but they seem to take almost a sadistic pleasure in destroying us as creatures who can still turn to God, to their enemy, creatures who can also still love, which they don’t seem capable of anymore. They’ve rejected the whole idea of goodness and love in a kind of perverted way.’Gay Christian rock star backed by Archbishop of Canterbury...Exorcism 101!

On one occasion, a demon told him how his mother had died – ovarian cancer. That evil spirit also knew ‘how 15 other people’s parents died, too. It wasn\u0027t just me.’On another occasion, a demon told him exactly what a priest was wearing though the clergyman was nowhere near Dr Gallagher and the possessed person speaking. In a different case, Gallagher was also personally addressed.‘I had a demon say to me: “How’s that book going? It won’t do any good” … that’s when I was first thinking of writing a book. So I’ve had demons come and they’ve said they hate me, but again, I think they hate all Christians … they certainly put more of their energy in saying how they hate the exorcist. That’s their real target, not me.He tells another story of a woman in her 30s, a member of a Satanist cult who was thinking about leaving – which is when the evil spirits took over her body.This woman ‘was in the back of a car once, and I was with the exorcist, and she went into a trance,’ he says. ‘She was unequivocally possessed … and I heard her in the back seat of the car.‘She came out with some vile stuff – “Leave her alone you f*****g priest”, that sort of thing, and this went on for about five minutes. Then she came out she had no remembrance of it at all.’                            I understand believing in evil spirits is not a very comforting belief ... when you\u0027ve seen some of these cases, you realize that this is clearly not something that could be explained by psychopathology or trickery or anything like that                         He continues: ‘I never went to her exorcisms, because I was busy … but the priest would invite me to come to the exorcism. It wasn’t around here. And I’m on the telephone line, this is a landline, with the priest at the time, and he says, “You know, Rich, can you make this exorcism session?” And then, during that phone conversation – and this woman was hundreds of miles away … that same voice came in on the phone and it said “Leave her alone, leave her alone, you f*****g priest. She’s ours, she’s not yours.” And I did hear that. That was creepy.’He says that, despite his work and beliefs regarding demons and possession, he has ‘never felt particularly harassed or discriminated against, because Americans tend to be kind of a tolerant, pluralistic people.‘In the larger society, it’s not a fringe belief,’ he says. ‘This is actually a mainstream belief. Opinion polls show that probably about 60 percent and upwards – probably about 70 percent of America – believe in the devil, and the majority of Americans … believe in evil spirits and demons have some ability to directly attack human beings.‘People will sometimes say to me, “How do you feel about talking about a fringe belief?” I say, “It’s not a fringe belief. I’m more mainstream than skeptics. The other thing about skeptics is, the extreme skeptics, they’ve never seen a case.‘They come up with all kinds of cockamamie theories … they say, “Well, you know, this person heard Latin babbled as a kid.” But it’s kind of absurd. The demon is speaking fluent Latin and is understanding fluent Latin, and many of these people are not even Catholic, didn’t even go to church as a kid.’He adds: ‘I understand believing in evil spirits is not a very comforting belief, and it has implications that, you know, we don’t want to accept. Having said that – and there’s plenty of alternate theories I don’t think that those theories usually hold water – and when you’ve seen some of these cases, you realize that this is clearly not something that could be explained by psychopathology or trickery or anything like that.’And, despite having witnessed evil and his interactions with demons, he says he’s not particularly worried that they’ll come after the psychiatrist himself he’s bolstered by his faith and the faith of others.‘I have a lot of people praying for me,’ he says.‘I’m not seeing the devil everywhere,’ he explains, adding: ‘I always tell people it’s an equal mistake to see the devil everywhere as to deny the devil exists.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/18/22/4D63715C00000578-5858359-image-a-28_1529358777315.jpg","title":"RICHARD KAY Markle debacle two","story":"Thomas Markle\u0027s bombshell television interview, in which some of his daughter Meghan and Prince Harry\u0027s most intimate secrets were exposed, left courtiers reeling.To be wrong-footed once as they were when the duchess\u0027s father announced he would not be giving Meghan away – so late in the day his presence could not be removed from the order of service – may be unfortunate. To be surprised for a second time, however, might be regarded as careless.If Mr Markle\u0027s remarks about his daughter and Harry trying for a baby – \u0027there\u0027s got to be a child in the making, somewhere soon\u0027 – were just cringe-making, his assertions about Harry\u0027s views on Donald Trump and Brexit were explosive.Quite apart from stripping aside his daughter\u0027s dignity, he has also exposed his new son-in-law to critics who will complain that members of the Royal Family have no business declaring an interest in the hottest political issues of the day.And ever since Trump became US President, and more particularly over controversial plans to invite him to Britain, the royals have been scrupulous to avoid revealing any views on the matter.          Mr Markle (pictured with his daughter) exposed some of his daughter Meghan and Prince Harry\u0027s most intimate secrets          To be wrong-footed once as they were when the duchess\u0027s father announced he would not be giving Meghan away may be unfortunate. Pictured, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle kiss on their wedding    In his interview on ITV\u0027s Good Morning Britain, Mr Markle spoke of his telephone conversations with Harry to Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid (pictured)Four weeks ago, old royal hands were left wondering why more effort hadn\u0027t been taken to ensure that Meghan\u0027s father was properly brought into his daughter\u0027s new world.Instead, aides were left floundering when it emerged that Mr Markle had foolishly participated in the staging of paparazzi pictures. The irony was that this act of invading his own privacy came at the very time Kensington Palace was sending strict warnings to the media not to harass him.It was hard to escape the conclusion that royal advisers had failed to realise that this lonely man — who lives in a run-down, Mexican border town — would struggle to deal with the enormity of his daughter marrying into the Royal Family.Why, they were asked, hadn\u0027t Mr Markle been helped? A consular official from the British embassy in Mexico City could have been sent up to brief him or even one of Prince Charles\u0027s more experienced aides flown out to acclimatise him.Yesterday, as they did a month ago, sources murmured that offers of assistance had been made to the former TV lighting director. Aides were reluctant to say more, but many thought that as soon as the wedding was over steps would have been taken to ensure Mr Markle felt he was part of the family.          Meghan Markle\u0027s mother Doria Ragland (left, with Prince Charles and Camilla) received the warmest of welcomes when she flew in from her LA home for the weddingThis might mean a new home, paid for by his wealthy son-in-law, and with an income to support himself and where he would have no need to give interviews for cash. At the very least one might have expected the newly-weds to have visited him by now – or arranged for him to visit them. His treatment – or rather a lack of it – contrasts wildly with that extended to his ex-wife and Meghan\u0027s mother, Doria Ragland. RICHARD KAY: Bouquet of her favourite forget-me-nots, flash of her dazzling aquamarine ring but most tantalising of all... was empty seat at the royal wedding REALLY for Diana?The boyfriend Meghan would rather forget: How a 22-year-old Miss Markle dated an award winning PORN STAR among a host of other young suitorsHow Prince Louis is named after a colossus of the empire cruelly cut down by the IRA who was implicated in a military plot to overthrow Labour PM Harold Wilson and whose wife was a voracious sexual adventurousRICHARD KAY: Charles still hasn’t seen the newborn prince because he has a difficult relationship with William RICHARD KAY asks the tantalising question: Will Kate copy the Queen with baby No 4? RICHARD KAY: The touching rituals that reveal just how much the Queen loved her corgis...they\u0027re buried at her favourite homes, each with a headstone on which she leaves posies of flowers.

Thomas Markle, thus far, seems to be excluded from it. One can only imagine how frustrating this must be for Prince Harry. Determined to protect his wife in the way he was never able to protect his late mother, Diana, the response of the Palace to Meghan\u0027s father has fallen short.Of one thing we can be sure: he will not be overly embarrassed that his views on Trump and the EU have emerged. One figure who has known the prince since he was a boy, says: \u0027You could say he handled a tricky conversation well. When asked about Brexit he was trying to be non-committal and on Trump he didn\u0027t want to be rude.\u0027A less generous view was being taken elsewhere however. As a young man whose experiences of America come from his time training with the US military and that ill-fated trip to Las Vegas, he might be disposed to thinking positively about Trump.Indeed the royals have followed Trump\u0027s rise closely. At a charity lunch before the 2016 US election, Prince Charles asked an American sitting next to him what Trump was like.    Mr Markle\u0027s assertions about Harry\u0027s views on Donald Trump and Brexit were explosive          Ever since Trump (pictured) became US President, the royals have been scrupulous to avoid revealing any views on the matterThe guest later admitted she was flustered because she didn\u0027t think royals talked about political figures. Perhaps this accounts for the sympathy that exists at Clarence House for this latest imbroglio involving Meghan\u0027s father.\u0027Prince Charles and Camilla like Meghan enormously, but they do feel that the team around her and Harry is rather inexperienced,\u0027 says an insider.Others, though, feel that the duchess herself could have done more to avoid difficulties. It is worth recalling that according to Meghan\u0027s biographer Andrew Morton, the former actress has long become used to compartmentalising her life.When success with TV series Suits arrived, she purged many childhood friends. Some might argue she has done the same with her close family. Her mother, after all, was the solitary representative of blood relatives at her daughter\u0027s wedding. Inevitably, those around the royals were comparing Mr Markle with another royal-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s father Michael Middleton.He has only ever spoken once – and then under strict Palace control – when his daughter became engaged to Prince William. In the near eight years since, he has said nothing.Sadly – with a little more due diligence – this Markle debacle Part 2 might have been wholly avoided. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/19/07/4D65851500000578-0-image-m-6_1529391584903.jpg","title":"Could SWEXIT Right wing Sweden Democrats call referendum EU membership","story":"    Swift Swexit: The leader of the far-right Sweden Democrats Jimmie Åkesson - currently second in the polls - has called for a Swedish EU referendum\u0027The EU is a large web of corruption where no one has control over anything,\u0027 Åkesson told Dagens Industri.\u0027We pay an enormous amount of money and get overwhelmingly little back.

Is it a French rococo whatnot? A Renaissance objet d’art? These are the kinds of European treasures this museum is famous for. But no. The beaten gold mask that holds you enthralled in this gorgeous exhibition was made in the Ashanti empire in west Africa in the 18th or 19th century. It is a masterpiece of African art that has lain tucked away in the abundance of the Wallace Collection since Victorian times.When the British empire was at war with the gold-rich Ashanti empire in 1873-74, this astonishing object was looted from the royal palace in Kumasi. It ended up in the hands of the royal jeweller Garrard and Co, which sold it to the wealthy and omnivorous collector Richard Wallace.This exhibition about Wallace – who was born 200 years ago, in 1818 – makes it clear what an atypical Victorian he was. Born illegitimate in London, he was taken to Paris to be educated by the family of his mother’s lover, the expatriate fourth Marquess of Hertford. He became the marquess’s private secretary and, in 1870, inherited his vast fortune. He was, almost certainly, Hertford’s son. The Wallace Collection, as it is called today, was started in Paris by the Marquess of Hertford, but it was Wallace who brought it to London and built the house that still holds it. He indulged his passions as a collector in the auction rooms of Victorian London, bidding against his rivals, the Rothschilds, for treasures from all over the world. This exhibition picks out some of his most precious finds to create a sumptuous survey of art and opulence, a portrait of the art collector as dreamer.This a great way to inaugurate the Wallace’s new underground exhibition space, an atmospheric lair that includes the Victorian coal vaults. Their arches now hold Wallace’s treasured Renaissance daggers and jewels. The dagger of Henri IV of France, made in about 1599, is lavishly inlaid with mother of pearl, yet Wallace bought it for sentimental reasons: Henry IV was a champion of religious tolerance who ended the wars of religion in France and was assassinated for his courage. In Paris, you can still find the Wallace fountains, free water points for the poor in a neo-Renaissance style that he put up and paid for after living in Paris during its siege and the commune in 1870-71.Wallace was a good European with a great eye for treasures. His boxwood statuette of Hercules, carved by Francesco Pomarano in about 1520, is a throbbingly homoerotic masterpiece of club-wielding muscle. A maiolica plate with a crowd of naked female bathers painted on it in 1525 is equally lusty. There was nothing puritanical about this Victorian collector who gleefully amassed things that once belonged to European rulers. The Horn of Saint Hubert, a coveted medieval relic with rich carvings done in the 15th century, was once the property of Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. Yet, that’s nothing. In researching this show, the curators established that two ornate Chinese cups in the collection were used by the Qianlong emperor in the 18th century in a ritual ceremony to ensure the stability of China.It didn’t work. Wallace bought the cups at a Paris auction in 1872. They had been looted from the Summer Palace when it was destroyed by Britain in 1860 in the second opium war.Wallace was a buccaneer collector in an age of global plunder and capitalist rapacity. The result is one of the world’s finest public art collections, a treasury we all share.

The OED is also looking to include the word “chopsy”, a Welsh term for an overly talkative person “frog-drowner”, which Americans might use to describe a torrential downpour of rain “brick”, which means “very cold” to residents of New Jersey and New York City and “round the Wrekin”, meaning “in a lengthy or roundabout manner” in the Midlands.The dictionary has already found that, depending on location, a picture hanging askew might be described as “agley”, “catawampous”, “antigodlin” or “ahoo” by an English speaker, while a loved one could be called a “doy”, “pet”, “dou-dou”, “bubele”, “alanna” or“babber”.“The OED aims to cover all types of English, including standard English, scientific and technical vocabulary, literary words, slang, and regionalisms. So it’s important to include these words to enable us to present a picture of the English language in all its forms,” said Maier.The Words Where You Are appeal is looking for more suggestions. These words will go alongside the regional words suggested by members of the UK public last year, when BBC Radio listeners were asked to send in their local turns of phrase, which were later included in poems by authors including Liz Berry and Hollie McNish for a National Poetry Day project.“We were surprised and pleased by the number of regional words we were able to include as a result,” said Maier. “With the public’s suggestions as a starting point we were able to unearth a rich seam of regional vocabulary.”Some of the words suggested in the UK date back centuries, such as “zamzawed” – Devon’s term for food or a meal that has been spoiled by overcooking – to more recent coinages such as “jarg”, used in Liverpool to refer to something false or misleading. Other additions now in the OED include “antwacky”, meaning old-fashioned, and “barry”, meaning great, with more to come.Maier said that it can be difficult for the OED’s lexicographers to identify regional words, as they are more often spoken than written down, and the editors require citable evidence to include a new definition. “In recent years, resources such as Twitter have been a great way for us to monitor the words that people are using informally in particular parts of the world and this, combined with targeted appeals, allows a lot more of these words to be identified and researched,” she said.“Tarzy”, for example, is a Middlesbrough word meaning a makeshift rope swing used to swing over a river or stream. Lexicographers have so far dated it back to 2003, but Maier said that it is likely to have been used before that, with a colleague’s mother remembering using it as a child in the 1970s. The word can only have arisen in the 20th century, however, as it derives from the Edgar Rice Burroughs’ character Tarzan.“Regional words indicate that their users come from a particular place and often contribute to one’s sense of identity,” said Maier. “You know you are home when words such as tarzy … can be used in the knowledge that they will be understood.”Regional vocabulary has been included in the OED since its first edition, with many of the public’s suggestions, such as “ginnel” (an alleyway), “grockle” (a tourist), “far-welted” (describing a sheep on its back), “nesh” (cold, susceptible to cold), “clarty” (very muddy), “sneck” (a latch), “kaylied” (drunk), and “throng” (busy), already listed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec6d2f7fca5041e93d92be439b4e7aa4552fba03/0_0_3000_2000/master/3000.jpg?w=1200\u0026h=630\u0026q=55\u0026auto=format\u0026usm=12\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9mYWNlYm9va19kZWZhdWx0LnBuZw\u0026s=9641b0634d6d0a1080108fd35a0fd31b","title":"brexit fairy tales public spending austerity","story":"Leaving the EU won’t result in a bonanza for public services but neither will it plunge them into renewed austerityTheresa May has spent the weekend trying to convince people that there is such a thing as a “Brexit idend” with the dead-eyed look of a minimum-wage sales assistant trying to get you to sign up for the extended warranty. It’s obvious nonsense even she doesn’t believe in, but her job depends on going through the motions, so go through them she will.May’s newly announced NHS spending promises come with the vaguest funding plans possible. She announced yesterday that “as a country taxpayers will need to contribute a bit more, but we will do that in a fair and balanced way,” which could mean almost anything. Mostly, though, she is relying on the notion that money we used to send to the EU will be freed up for other things. This claim has been comprehensively, utterly debunked ever since it first appeared on the side of Boris Johnson’s infamous bus. The Office for Budget Responsibility and the Institute for Fiscal Studies have both pointed out, again, that it won’t happen and has no relationship to reality. It’s a lie, and at this stage it’s not even a very good one.We should not fall into a false binary trap, though. The absence of the mythical idend does not mean we will not be able to fund the NHS.Without the Brexit idend, the other funding options are taxes or deficit spending, and the government can’t deficit spend unless it abandons its fiscal targets. But these targets are not an immutable fact of economic logic. They are policy positions the government made for political reasons. These targets have done immense damage to the real economy of the UK, and will continue to do so while they remain in place. They can be abandoned, and they should be.The argument for austerity is even more threadbare than it was when Cameron and Osborne pulled their con in 2010. As a new working paper from the International Monetary Fund points out, and as heterodox economists have been saying for years, the standard assumptions about the sustainability of government debt are wrong. The UK can deficit spend and issue gilts to invest in the NHS, and the country will not collapse around our ears as a result.During the 2007-08 financial crisis the real economy took a hit, with people losing their jobs and businesses losing revenue. This meant tax revenues decreased and spending on unemployment benefits increased, and so the government budget deficit increased. Very serious and sensible people told us this meant that we had to cut spending to get the deficit under control, on the basis that this would somehow fix the economy.This was a mistake. When the economy goes into a downturn, it is necessary for the government to increase spending and run a deficit. If it does not, as our government did not after the financial crisis, then government policy compounds the problems of the private sector, stifling growth and strangling economic recovery.After Brexit we will also most likely see a downturn in real economic activity. Imports and exports will take a hit, which will lower productivity and raise prices. The extent of this hit depends on where Brexit falls on the hardsoft spectrum, and on the degree of additional border friction, but nobody credible believes it won’t happen at all.This will lower tax revenues and so, just as after the financial crisis, the deficit will rise. However, arguing that this will necessitate a cut in public spending is to accept the logic of austerity. The government can run a deficit after Brexit just as it should have run one after the financial crisis. The people who argue that economic downturns make public services unaffordable were wrong then, and they are wrong now.Those who oppose Brexit will be tempted to play up the potential downsides, but by arguing that Brexit will constrain fiscal policy to such an extent that the government will have no choice but to cut public services, they risk making their warnings into a self-fulfilling prophecy. Such arguments would give an ideologically driven Tory government the cover for further cuts, or could be used to try to argue a Labour government’s policy of increased spending was unaffordable. After years of public sector cuts, we will need to increase spending whether Brexit happens or not. Given that the most likely outcome is that some kind of Brexit will happen, it seems unwise to spend the run-up to it talking about how it’s going to mean we need to cut funding for public services, even for short-term strategic reasons.This is not to say that we should be sanguine about the impact of Brexit. Border friction and inflation will have real effects. The stimulative impact of deficit spending will be absorbed, to a greater or lesser extent, by weakening trade and inflation. We cannot simply say that Brexit difficulties can be fully countered with active fiscal policy and leave it there. But we need to be having the discussion, in a realistic appraisal of what will happen and what we can do about it – not in a simplistic binary world where the only two choices are “all the money we get back from the EU will pay for magical ponies for all” or “Brexit means we have to sack all the nurses”.Let’s try to learn some lessons from the last decade rather than blindly repeating the same mistakes. Making up economic fairytales for partisan advantage won’t do anyone any good.• Phil McDuff writes on economics and social policy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab58b5f4add9267ab7442b77a404a320b4cdca6/1_0_2559_1536/master/2559.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9df835819390ab1761fe6f12298b1ad7","title":"europe progressive far right eu liberal","story":"EU liberal values face a direct threat from populist nationalist forces. The democratic-minded have a clear choice to makeThe battle lines are now drawn for Europe’s ultimate test: the May 2019 elections for the European parliament. That’s when far-right and populist parties will attempt to complete their power grab in the EU. In the elections of 2014, they made gains. Next year, they’ll seek to dominate. The dramatic events we’ve witnessed over the past fortnight, in Germany and Italy have been a mere foretaste of the showdown that lies ahead.It’s often said that anti-establishment and nationalist parties want to dismantle the European project altogether. But what’s at stake is more likely to be a full-on effort to redraw it to their liking. The migration issue is the starting point of a continental power struggle pitching two very different versions of the principles that should bind Europe together. One is liberal democratic, and attuned to the notion of an open society the other is fortress-minded, illiberal and intolerant. This has global implications: anti-EU leaders in Washington and Moscow want to reap their own rewards from the mayhem – which they are playing their own part in fomenting.June 2018 shook Europe’s liberal order in unprecedented ways. First, there was a far-right show of strength in Italy (the first EU founding state to be run by a far-right dominated government), as the Aquarius migrant rescue ship was turned away. Next, the 31-year-old Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, who governs alongside the Freedom party, an institution created in the 1950s by former Nazis, heralded the creation of a new “axis of the willing” in Europe, comprising like-minded populists in Italy and Hungary.Then came an assault on the power of Angela Merkel in Berlin. The chancellor has now been given a two-week ultimatum by her own federal minister of the interior, Horst Seehofer, leader of the conservative Bavarian Christian Social Union, a party that has absorbed just about all of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland rhetoric on migrants. The EU summit scheduled for the end of this month, and destined to dominated by the subject of immigration, is likely to be an acrimonious shambles.To top it all off, from across the Atlantic Donald Trump decided the occasion warranted one of the most provocative tweets of his presidency. In an intervention unprecedented for a US leader, Trump appeared to relish the possibility of Merkel’s downfall, writing: “The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition.” Trump had earlier given the nod to irredentism in Europe, in claiming: “Crimea is Russia because people there speak Russian.” Who else will have heard that message loud and clear: far-right Hungarian irredentists perhaps, who still dream of a Greater Hungary stretching beyond current borders? One could be forgiven for quoting Yeats: “Things fall apart the centre cannot hold Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.”“Axis”, with its second world war connotations, is perhaps an innocent choice of words by Kurz – or perhaps not. An ideological nexus does connect him to Viktor Orbán in Hungary, Seehofer in Bavaria and Matteo Salvini in Italy. Look at the map, and what emerges is the shaping of a core transalpine and Danubian Europe of the far-right and nationalist conservatism. With elections due in October in Seehofer’s powerful southern regional German state, and the Austrian presidency of the EU Council starting on 1 July, Catholic-dominated, German-speaking regions of Europe look set to define much of the debate about Europe’s future.Trump may well be oblivious to the minutiae and dark symbolism. But be sure that Vladimir Putin isn’t. Some of these political forces have a track record of closeness to Russia’s strongman. The far-right Freedom party, to take one example, has a formal partnership with the Kremlin-sponsored United Russia party, and regularly calls for the lifting of EU sanctions – just as Seehofer does. Meanwhile, in the midst of his World Cup extravaganza, Putin is reportedly awaiting a call from Washington soon to set up a meeting with Trump – a summit Kurz would like to host in Vienna.What Seehofer, Orbán and others are gearing up for is an overthrow of the values of the liberal order within the EU. They want to mould it according to their conservative Christian, nation-centered beliefs, and they see the west as being under assault from non-white and Muslim threats and migration. This was a vision also laid out by Trump, remember, in his 2017 Warsaw speech.They don’t want to break up Europe, they want to take control of it. The “axis” will grow branches in Poland’s populist-led government and in parts of the Balkans. These people may not agree on everything, (for example, Salvini wants compulsory EU relocation plans for refugees, which Orbán rejects) but their interests are sufficiently aligned to make this the perfect moment to launch a common assault on EU institutions.The “axis” aims to get rid of Merkel and seize control of the European People’s party (EPP), which has dominated the EU parliament for years and encompasses all the mainstream rightwing forces. The EPP has been a vehicle for Merkel’s hegemony over the EU all these years, which is one of the reasons she has always refrained from chucking out Orbán and his Fidesz party.These leaders are now uniting to attempt a national-populist takeover of the EU as we’ve known it. Merkel is only the first target in a wider endeavour. And don’t be fooled by talk of an utterly powerless EU parliament: it does matter if the populists gain control, because the parliament has co-decision powers on legislation, alongside the council of ministers.Orbán, who’s arguably the most outspoken about this, made the strategy abundantly clear in a speech last week. He suggested the EPP would need to change if it wanted to survive, and threatened to set up a new, “pan-European anti-immigration formation” if the EPP isn’t ready to be renewed on his terms. What’s to be done? The French president, Emmanuel Macron, and Merkel (if she survives the coming weeks in power) will try to peel away some parts of the “axis”. Macron has already courted Kurz in the Elysée palace, despite his association with the far right. On Tuesday Macron met Merkel at a castle north of Berlin to try to showcase a plan for eurozone consolidation. The news coming out of Europe isn’t all bad. Spain has a new, centre-left government. The EU’s economy is also doing better, and polls show growing support for it among citizens.But for the democratic-minded across Europe, now is the time to make a clear choice. There’s no need to be obsessed with history to know that, when the “rough beast” slouches, “its hour come round at last” (Yeats again), surely anti-far-right forces must unite.Given the context, hard-left clashes with centrists become something of a distraction. And criticism of the EU’s institutional “democratic deficit” is currently a sideshow. Let’s protect what we have. On 14 June, in the European parliament, the far left and the far right voted together against a resolution calling for the release of political prisoners in Russia. Would they likewise have voted together against a call for the release of migrant children held in cages by Trump’s America? Some people need to get their priorities right, before it’s too late."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/134e06c495726618f9941d3c0d379f9105930076/0_10_613_368/master/613.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7a5a4a9f5a6f500c5b0cd6ae575788b","title":"david copperfield summer of magic exhibits his collection of wonders","story":"In a new exhibit, artefacts from the magician’s personal collection are on displayThose attending the press preview of the New York Historical Society’s latest exhibition expected a tour of David Copperfield’s personal collection of magic paraphernalia, widely regarded to be the biggest and most comprehensive such archive in the world. What we didn’t expect, however, was a tour guided by Copperfield himself, who emerged from behind a lectern in the museum’s vestibule, in the sleek all-black ensemble he often wears onstage, to unveil Summer of Magic: Treasures from the David Copperfield Collection.Both an ode to the rich history of magic in New York City, and an itemized primer on the conjurors and illusionists who preceded Copperfield, the show came about after the museum’s assistant curator of exhibitions, Cristian Petru Panaite, emailed the magician last fall asking for a tour of his collection. Known as the International Museum and Library of the Conjuring Arts, it’s housed in a windowless Vegas warehouse and contains over 200,000 trinkets and artefacts that amount, more or less, to a multi-century history of magic, from Harry Keller to Chung Ling Soo.“The New York Historical Society has been interested for quite some time in exploring magic as entertainment and as art,” said Panaite, who in 1991 watched Copperfield make the Statue of Liberty disappear on television in his native Romania, where such spectacles were censored until after the fall of communism. “I wrote David, having read about the collection, and I actually remember waking my wife up after getting a text back from him. So it’s very special and surreal for me to be able to curate this exhibition.”To watch Copperfield explore the exhibit, staged just a mile north of the Times Square magic shops he perused obsessively as a teenager, is a bit like watching an episode of Cosmos with Neil DeGrasse Tyson. One moment Copperfield’s an unabashed fanboy, presumably no different than the 12-year-old who regularly took the train from New Jersey to the Tannen’s Magic Shop. And the next he’s a walking encyclopedia, lecturing us about Harry Houdini’s infamous metamorphosis trunk and breaking down heated rivalries among early 20th century magicians.“Houdini didn’t like many magicians because they were all ripping him off,” he said. “I know the feeling.”Copperfield, who began performing professionally at age 12 as “Davino the Boy Magician”, was inspired by Houdini’s daredevilry, which had an emotional component that transcended mere showmanship. “It wasn’t just a trick or a challenge, they were rooting for him. And that’s why we remember Houdini to this day,” he says. “I saw this and said, ‘Gosh, this is kind of cool.’ My personal passion was telling stories based in Broadway or MGM musicals, so we invented this next piece you’re about to see...”The 61-year-old proceeds to “Death Saw”, the massive, and massively anxiety-inducing, moving contraption he used to chop himself in two in a 1988 special on CBS. “People thought this was going to be an escape because, when someone would get strapped to a table or train tracks, everyone was conditioned to expect them to get out before the train hits,” he said as footage of the original stunt played. “The audience was really upset. A few years later they knew what was coming, but the first time they really freaked out.”Though Copperfield emerged from the death saw unscathed, other illusionists haven’t been as lucky. In the section of the exhibition dedicated to the “Masters of Magic”, various ephemera from 19th century conjurors like Alexander Herrman and Jean Eugene Robert-Houdin are displayed in perspex cases. Among them is the musket with which Williams Ellsworth Robinson, who performed as an Asian man named Chung Ling Soo, fatally attempted the “bullet catch” trick at the Wood Green Empire in London in 1918.“16 people have died doing this,” said Copperfield. “But the most famous one was Chung Ling Soo.”In another corridor is a recreation of Tannen’s, the magic shop Copperfield describes as the center of his boyhood existence. It was there he saw entertainers like Dick Cavett, Frank Sinatra and Orson Welles – “everybody on the Ed Sullivan show,” as he puts it. “It was like being in heaven,” Copperfield said. “It’s important to remember, because there’s fewer and fewer magic shops today, but the brick-and-mortar magic shop was a place you just couldn’t believe. You’d save your money and buy the magic piece and when you’d go home you thought you were the hero.”Although Summer of Magic is nothing if not nostalgic, the items as assembled illustrate how the craft constantly points toward the future. George Méliès, the illusionist-turned-film-maker, shot A Trip to the Moon almost 70 years before Neil Armstrong stepped foot on it. And a turban on display, which once belonged the vaudeville magician Alexander the Man Who Knows, was equipped with radios before people knew what they were.“This is important because magic has given us technology we wouldn’t normally have,” said Copperfield. “The magic I’m doing, eventually the secret will be revealed and it will become common. Kids see something, a trip to the moon, and go, ‘Maybe it is possible.’ I think that’s a great legacy to have, and that’s why I do what I do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7614bb2f405b23987881d600bf623435276e8adf/0_23_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c50be2f938f09a97eea975b71443772f","title":"exam board sorry for audio mix up in french and spanish a levels","story":"Students still have to apply for ‘special consideration’ to have mark adjusted, says EduqasAn examination board has apologised to A-level students and their teachers after a mix-up in recordings made it difficult for candidates to answer questions in Spanish and French exams taken this month.Students were quick to register their anger and confusion on social media after sitting the exam, with some calling it “impossible” and “diabolical”. “Please tell me I’m not the only one who completely guessed every answer for question 4,” tweeted one.Eduqas – an arm of the Welsh examination board WJEC – issued an apology but said that any students who felt they were affected would have to apply for “special consideration” to adjust their marks.The problem arose with the paper’s rubric instructing students to listen to the second part of a recording in order to answer a particular questions. But the board said candidates also needed to re-listen to an earlier part of the recording in order to answer parts of the question.“We appreciate that this error may have affected candidates in yesterday’s examination. A special consideration can be made on behalf of those candidates,” said Elaine Carlile, director of assessment delivery at Eduqas.The board also admitted that a similar issue was noted in a Spanish A-level exam last week. “Our examiners and the awarding committee members will be made aware of the situation,” it said. “Candidate responses will be considered carefully during the marking and awarding processes to ensure that no candidate is disadvantaged.”The mix-up is only likely to affect a small number of candidates with Eduqas being the arm of the WJEC board approved to offer exams in England rather than in Wales.

Asos – the second biggest clothing site in the UK, with 64.4m visitors in the six months to May 2018 – has pledged to ban silk, mohair, cashmere and feathers from its site from January 2019. In addition, products using down, teeth and bone – including mother-of-pearl, which is taken from the shell of some molluscs – also fall under the planned ban. Peta, the animal rights organisation, came out in support of Asos’s move to update its animal welfare policy. “The global online retail platform is reflecting a profound shift in public attitudes towards the rearing and killing of animals for fashion,” said Peta UK’s director, Elisa Allen. “Consumers are changing the face of the industry by demanding that designers and retailers offer clothing and accessories that look beautiful without harming animals.”Asos’s policy states the site’s point of view. “Asos firmly believes it is not acceptable for animals to suffer in the name of fashion or cosmetics,” it reads. “Asos is committed to working with industry expert groups to support the ongoing research, development and implementation of animal welfare standards and transparency in the leather supply chain.”These materials in question are believed to have an impact on the animals concerned. Some cashmere goats are said to be the subject of enforced winter shearings meaning they are exposed to harsh temperatures, while it is believed that some angora goats are mutilated to produce fluffy mohair. The production of silk, meanwhile, has seen manufacturers boiling silk worms inside their cocoons.Asos follows Zara, H\u0026ampM and Topshop, who all pledged last month to stop using mohair, but takes this further, suggesting that this is an issue close to the hearts of their target market, typically young shoppers in their 20s.Asos’s announcement is part of a wider trend in fashion towards a more conscious use of animal products. At the high-fashion level, Gucci, Michael Kors and Versace have all pledged to go fur-free in the last year. Gucci CEO Marco Bizzarri commented: “I don’t think it’s still modern and that’s the reason why we decided not to do that.”The next step may be the sale of fur banned in the UK. After 110,000 people signed a petition, the issue was debated in parliament this month.

From high fashion to the high street, it’s one of the biggest looks of the yearUsually one to set trends rather than follow them, Beyoncé this weekend did as the likes of her sister Solange, Harry Styles, Zayn Malik and Salma Hayek have done before her: she wore a pink suit, pushing it to the forefront of 2018’s fashion canon by opting to wear it in the video for the first single from her long-awaited joint album with Jay-Z, Everything Is Love.Of course, being Beyoncé, she did it with more of a sense of pomp than most: standing in front of the Mona Lisa in a Louvre emptied of tourists, leaving space for Queen Bey and Jay-Z to chart their own course through art history as they launched an album that has been described as “celebrating their marriage and black identity”. The pink of the suit pops against the more muted tones of the art. Its clashing red tassel belt could be read as a visual nod to the velvet rope that would usually accompany a visit to the Louvre, just not for Queen Bey.The look that takes centre stage is from the autumnwinter 2018 collection of relatively unknown London-based label Peter Pilotto. Launched in 2007, it’s a label best known for its prints and sexiness – and it’s something of a sartorial curveball from Beyoncé, even as someone who is unafraid to throw them on her recent tour, for instance, she teamed pieces from fashion gods Gucci with lesser-known designers such as LaQuan Smith. So while Beyoncé can start trends with her little finger, she is very much jumping on an already rumbling bandwagon here. The current penchant for the pink suit was arguably sparked, as with so many other trends, by Gucci. That catalyst was part of Alessandro Michele’s springsummer 2018 collection. Worn by a red-haired model who walked down the catwalk in a matching pink shirt and pink tie, Vogue called the look “Lady-Penelope-meets-Bianca-Jagger” and it has proven, according to Candice Fragis, buying and merchandising director at luxury stockist Farfetch, to be “really popular”, “in line with the colourful tailoring trend”.Beyoncé, then, is one in a long and illustrious line of pink suit wearers, but she might just be the first to wear one to an audience of two with the Mona Lisa."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9188273b288f103d267e3197a4ff49b6be8d2fa/158_5_2787_1673/master/2787.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b25c1c0770e578e55d2608c69b3db5c5","title":"arsenal bayer leverkusen bernd leno","story":"• German set to sign five-year deal after £19m fee agreed• Unai Emery will turn sights to Sampdoria’s Lucas TorreiraArsenal have confirmed a deal to sign the goalkeeper Bernd Leno from Bayer Leverkusen, believed to be for an initial €22m (£19.2m).The 26-year-old, who was part of the Germany squad that won the Confederations Cup last year but was not selected for this summer’s World Cup, is believed to have agreed a five-year deal at the Emirates after he was identified as the long-term successor to Petr Cech. Leno was an integral part of the Leverkusen side which finished fifth in the Bundesliga last season, having begun his career at Stuttgart, and it is understood that Arsenal could pay up to another £3m in bonuses as part of the deal. Both clubs confirmed the deal on Tuesday night.“We are very pleased that Bernd Leno will be joining us,” said Arsenal’s head coach, Unai Emery. “Bernd is a goalkeeper of high quality and experience. We are all excited that Bernd has chosen Arsenal and look forward to start working with him in pre-season.”The arrival casts doubt over the future of Cech, who has only one year remaining on the contract he signed when he moved from Chelsea in 2015.Arsenal are also closing in on the signing of the Uruguay midfielder Lucas Torreira of Sampdoria for £25m and the Greece defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos from Borussia Dortmund for around £16m as Emery continues his rebuilding job.

The Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) said the injury was not serious, adding that Neymar left as a precaution and would be back in training on Wednesday.The CBF said Neymar has been in pain since the team’s 1-1 draw against Switzerland on Friday, when he was consistently fouled. Neymar started training with the rest of the squad but left accompanied by a doctor about 30 minutes into the session in Sochi.He had been involved in a game of rondo with a few other players when he started showing signs of discomfort in his ankle. He was visibly in pain after he tried to intercept a ball with his right foot while at the centre of the rondo circle.At one point, he bent down and grabbed his ankle but tried to continue playing anyway. A few moments later he finally decided to leave, kicking a ball away with his left foot before limping away beside the team doctor.“Neymar left the training session with some pain in his right ankle because of the number of fouls he suffered in the game against Switzerland,” said the CBF spokesman Vinicius Rodrigues. “Since today was only a recovery session for the starters, and he complained about pain, he ended going to rehabilitation.”Rodrigues said Neymar would continue his recovery process but was set to train normally on Wednesday, two days before the team’s match against Costa Rica in St Petersburg. Brazil and Switzerland are two points behind the group leaders, Serbia, who defeated Costa Rica 1-0 in their opener.Meanwhile, the CBF has asked Fifa why the video assistant referee was not used to review two key decisions they believe hindered their side during the 1-1 draw with Switzerland on Sunday.Brazil players complained long and hard that the defender Miranda was pushed by Steven Zuber when he headed home Switzerland’s equaliser early in the second half of their Group E opener. They also believe Gabriel Jesus was manhandled inside the penalty area and should have been awarded a spot kick. Neither incident appeared to be reviewed.“The CBF requires to know from Fifa the reason the technology was not used in key incidents during the game,” the organisation said in a statement.VAR is being used in the World Cup for the first time and, according to Fifa, should only “correct clear and obvious errors and missed incidents in clearly defined match‑changing decisions”.Brazil believe the two incidents, neither of which they referred to directly, are covered by that explanation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de5ba224e63c74dd06e27fb1b6ade9e9831f3821/0_10_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b430c3d2d3bbe8269b4c241a9cc0472","title":"colombia japan world cup group h match report","story":"It is difficult to imagine a team making a more calamitous start to a World Cup than Colombia did and unfortunately for José Pekerman and his players there was another blow to come on top of being a goal and a man down inside a chaotic first six minutes.Yuya Osako delivered it with an emphatic second-half header to give Japan a victory that leaves Colombia, who were quarter-finalists in Brazil four years ago, with much to do if they are to progress from a tricky group.The tone of a glorious afternoon in Saransk was set during that remarkable opening period. There were two minutes and 56 seconds on the clock when Carlos Sánchez was shown a straight red card for a deliberate handball inside the penalty area. It was the second-fastest sending off in World Cup history – José Alberto Batista’s dismissal for Uruguay against Scotland in 1986 after 54 seconds will take some beating – and Shinji Kagawa was not going to pass up the chance to put Japan ahead from the spot.Down to 10 men and without James Rodríguez, who was not fit enough to start, Colombia looked like a team in a state of shock and, although they showed plenty of character and no little class to haul themselves back into the game, courtesy of Juan Quintero’s clever free-kick shortly before the interval, the numerical advantage started to tell in the second half and it was no real surprise when Japan regained the lead through Osako.Colombia tried to respond again in the closing stages, when Rodríguez had a left-foot shot blocked, but playing the best part of an hour and a half with 10 men took a draining toll.“Normally you prepare a match to play 11 v 11, so to lose one player in the first three minutes, such a crucial player, that’s not an easy thing,” Pekerman said. “We lost because we were worn down and tired.”Japan were euphoric as they basked in the glory of an unexpected win – they are among the lowest-ranked teams at the tournament – and their first World Cup victory since 2010. It was a particularly satisfying afternoon for Akira Nishino, who took over as the manager only two months ago following the decision to sack Vahid Halilhodzic.Japan impressed at times, in particular during the period leading up to Osako’s winner, yet there was no getting away from the fact that Sánchez’s red card was the defining moment and had a huge impact on the outcome.Davinson Sánchez, who experienced a difficult match, has to take his share of the blame for the chain of events that unfolded. The Tottenham defender got in a terrible tangle dealing with a routine ball over the top that culminated in Osako scampering clear.David Ospina, who was to make a couple of excellent saves in the second half, blocked Osako’s effort with his legs but the Colombia goalkeeper had only just managed to get to his feet when the loose ball fell to Kagawa.The forward’s first-time shot would have put Japan ahead but Carlos Sánchez instinctively stuck out his right arm to block and Damir Skomina, the Slovenian referee, reached for his back pocket before brandishing a red card.The former Aston Villa player complained bitterly and took several minutes to leave the field as Colombia players surrounded Skomina, yet he was left with no option. With the benefit of hindsight, Carlos Sánchez may well reflect he would have been far better off letting Kagawa score – a view reinforced when the Borussia Dortmund forward calmly rolled his spot-kick past Ospina, who ed the wrong way.With Colombia trying to adapt to playing with 10 men – it was 31 minutes before Pekerman made a change and decided to replace Juan Cuadrado with Wilmar Barrios – space opened up for Japan to score a second goal. Takashi Inui and Osako squandered presentable chances before Quintero equalised in quite brilliant fashion after Radamel Falcao was fouled just outside the area.Anticipating that the four players in the wall would jump, Quintero placed a low left-foot shot underneath them, catching out Eiji Kawashima, the Japan goalkeeper, who frantically tried to get across his line to keep the ball out. Kawashima had too much ground to make up and goal-line technology confirmed what just about everyone in the stadium suspected: Colombia were level.It was deserved on the balance of play but the second half was a different story as Japan, who were encouraged at half-time by Nishino to be much more positive and to move the ball more quickly, started to dominate.Pekerman introduced Rodríguez and Carlos Bacca to try to give Colombia some fresh attacking impetus but it was Japan who carried the greater threat. Ospina denied Inui and Osako before the latter, climbing above Santiago Arias, headed in Keisuke Honda’s corner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a115953344ba308d7aa452cec3b309c78782d28/1062_418_2915_1750/master/2915.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d0a5c5e1767c902619e63c7cdc4bad5","title":"panama president juan carlos varela world cup","story":"The president of Panama spent Monday night watching England play football. Juan Carlos Varela, who signed an emergency decree declaring a public holiday the night the country qualified for the World Cup for the first time, was with the national team at their hotel by the Black Sea when Harry Kane scored.Earlier, he had been in Sochi’s Fisht Stadium a kilometre away to see Panama make their debut against Belgium. And despite a 3-0 defeat Varela, hopping from foot to foot, kicking an imaginary ball as he relives a historic evening, says he is proud of his players. He also feels Panama’s hard game is now out of the way – even though it’s England next. He had been studying them\u0026nbspafter all.Three days before Varela had been sitting alongside Vladimir Putin in Red Square – and that, he says, is a demonstration of the power and reach of football. According to Varela, president since 2014 and invited to the opera gala on the eve of the tournament, the World Cup not only represents a unique opportunity for the players but for a nation whose reputation was hit by the Panama Papers revelations and which continues to seek solutions to the social problems confronted by its toughest neighbourhoods. In April last year, the Panama midfielder Amílcar Henríquez was shot over 20 times outside his home in Colón.“When I saw our flag come out with the other 31 in Moscow, it was very emotional. And when I had the chance to go to the opera alongside president Putin\u0026nbsp…” he says smiling, the sentence trailing off. “It wasn’t the president sitting alongside Putin, it was the players because I was representing them. I told them: ‘I didn’t do anything to be sitting there it was you.’ The only way I could have been there was because the national team was playing at the World Cup. I can go on a state visit to Moscow, visit Putin, or Trump, China, Theresa May, but sit alongside Putin at the opera? I thanked the players for allowing me to be here. Two hours at the opera, listening and chatting to the Russian president about things, political questions, peace, social issues, even Syria.“Football is not just the sport itself but what it means socially, how it brings people together. To see the stadium full with almost 45,000 people and to hear that it was mostly supporting us – not just people from Panama but Panamanians from around the world. I saw a Belgian married to a Panamanian, one in each kit. Football is a lovely party. We didn’t know Russia and they don’t know Latin America. Listening to 40,000 Peruvians was incredible. And seeing the Panama flag everywhere in Sochi, I owe that to these lads.“Henríquez’s death was a very sad moment for us and it left a scar. But these players are an example for the kids in the barrio. The problem is poor leadership, bad examples, economics. But when they see these lads, that creates a model to follow. We can all help, everyone in their field: them on the pitch, me with the country’s security.”Varela says there are plans to build an elite performance centre, as Costa\u0026nbspRica did develop youth football, which is almost entirely lacking in structure and encourage private investment in the clubs and a league which is yet to generate significant income.“The World Cup puts Panama on the map,” he says. “Being in Russia is a great honour and it positions Panama: the entire planet sees Panamanian players against England and Belgium. Imagine it in marketing terms: you begin with the premise that what matters is that they know your name, then that they have a good impression of you, then maybe they decide to visit the country, look for a product. Panama can be heard, known, and project itself through sport.”Above all, it gives Panama a chance to show its footballers. “In\u0026nbspthe first half, we saw a team that played football against the third strongest side in the world, a team that’s one of the favourites to win the competition,” Varela says. “It’s not just playing your first game it’s competing with dignity as we did. There were even chances to have scored.“Before the game, I said to them: when these three games end – or further along, as we don’t know what will happen – you must feel like they’ve done everything they wanted to. That’s what matters. I saw an organised, structured team that despite the scoreline never collapsed. We showed we can play football.”And then the president settled in to watch England. “I was studying them with the lads,” he says. In the hotel, a roar could be heard late on. Was that them? Did you want England to score? Varela laughs. “What I want is for Panama to score,” comes the reply. “But we feel the hard game was today’s.”England are going to be easy, then? “I didn’t say that!” he says, laughing. “All the games will be hard for us but the hardest was today.” The most historic, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e4ff95bc5c6fe58f302fe653e1daf4cec045071/0_316_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=abb863371d16cfbe0a6a8a6cb75119ea","title":"poland senegal world cup group h match report","story":"Aliou Cissé broke down in tears in front of his Senegal players a few days ago. The manager had been overcome following prayers with his squad and, perhaps, by what it all meant for his country to be at a World Cup for only the second time in their history.The first, famously, had been in 2002, when Cissé was the midfielder enforcer for the late Bruno Metsu’s team who shocked the world and European champions France in the opening group tie en\u0026nbsproute to a heartbreaking quarter-final exit against Turkey. No African team have gone further in the competition.Cissé has felt the weight of history and he has known his challenge is to bring those low‑definition images up to date. On a glorious occasion for the Teranga Lions, he got off to the perfect start. Each of the four other African nations here had lost their opening games but Senegal, who are arguably the continent’s most fancied team, punished a pair of hideous defensive mix-ups from Poland to spark wild scenes among their supporters.The opening goal was a nightmare for the Poland centre-half Thiago Cionek, who played instead of the injured first-choice Kamil Glik. Idrissa Gueye’s shot was going wide when he deflected it past the wrong-footed Wojciech Szczesny. But the second on the hour was an even greater calamity.Grzegorz Krychowiak’s back-pass was dreadfully mishit and, with confusion reigning between Szczesny and the substitute Jan Bednarek, Mbaye Niang stole in to finish. The striker had been off the field for treatment and, when he came back on, he shot straight through to score. Senegal had been readying Cheikh Ndoye at the same time and Poland did not expect to see Niang.“The players thought a substitute was coming on – that’s why there was a big misunderstanding,” Adam Nawalka, the Poland manager, said.Krychowiak ignited the possibility of a late Poland fightback with a firm header from Kamil Grosicki’s free-kick but it never looked on. At full-time some of the Senegal players sank to their knees and kissed the turf. For them, hope springs eternal.“This is not the same taste as the France result in 2002,” Cissé said. “France colonised Senegal so when we faced them it was quite exceptional. But this victory is just as important. It was absolutely important for Africa that we won. Senegal represent the whole continent. I can guarantee the whole of Africa is supporting Senegal.”Poland could not get going, with Robert Lewandowski shackled by Salif Sané and Kalidou Koulibaly. “Plans are one thing, the implementation is something different,” Nawalka said. “Our actions were not coordinated and dynamic. When we play Colombia next I’m convinced we will have a much better mental attitude.”The striker Arkadiusz Milik said: “It was one of our worst performances for a long time. Senegal built a wall and we were not able to jump over it. I’m not sure if Senegal played well or we were so bad.”The game had been deadlocked and it needed a goal. Gueye had a hand in it and, if it was marked by good fortune, he and Senegal would argue they made it for themselves.Niang won the ball from Lukasz Piszczek on the halfway line and he advanced before feeding Sadio Mané, who rolled it square to Gueye. He had Michal Pazdan jumping into a block in front of him and his connection was not clean. He dragged it and the ball was heading wide before fate – and Cionek – intervened.The statistics showed there had been no shots on target in the first half and Poland, in particular, offered nothing as an attacking threat. Nawalka swapped Jakub Blasczykowski, who won his 100th cap, for Bednarek and switched from 4-4-2 to 3-4-3 but things would get worse.The danger was minimal when Krychowiak looked to lob a pass back to Szczesny from just inside the Senegal half but he got it all wrong, leaving it short. Part two of the breakdown was between Szczesny and Bednarek. The goalkeeper resolved to race out for it and Bednarek hesitated, presumably having heard a call from him.Szczesny never looked like getting there first and, when Niang nipped in, he flicked the ball over the goalkeeper before running on to score. Szczesny had started the inquest before Niang tapped into the empty net.Poland had cried fouled in the 49th minute when Lewandowski won the ball and blasted away only to be blocked off by Sané. The covering defender Moussa Wagué probably saved his teammate a red card. Sané escaped with yellow. Khadim Ndiaye sprang to his left to keep out Lewandowski’s free-kick."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bdc44a4e9a2f2063850415a325b50bed52bab35/0_262_4296_2578/master/4296.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf929b09680607cba2a2adc6753747cc","title":"russia egypt world cup match report","story":"Artem Dzyuba sealed victory for Russia in their second Group A, as the host nation all but qualified with a 3-1 win against Egypt.

Russia is putting on its best, most smiling face for the month: people are excited to welcome the tournament and the fans, and so far at least that is leading to overwhelmingly positive vibes. The cheap beer and warm sunshine in most host cities is not hindering this process, either. With Russian transport corridors all running through the capital, Moscow has become a hub for fans, with tens of thousands shuttling through for a couple of nights between games and creating a carnival atmosphere. Shaun Walker“We are the victims of Fifa and the ever-developing football,” the Egypt goalkeeper Essam El Hadary lamented on Monday. His manager, Héctor Cúper, appeared to find the comment amusing and it is, after all, a well-established rite of passage that shot-stoppers line up to take a pop at the ball. Igor Akinfeev is another to have had his say about the Telstar 18, but it is hard to see what they are complaining about because this summer’s edition seems the most reliable for some time. If the litmus test for a ball’s performance is the way it behaves on long-range shots and deliveries into the box then it has passed. Free-kicks from Aleksandr Golovin, Cristiano Ronaldo and Aleksandar Kolarov have left keepers helpless because the players were able to trust their technique rather than worry about the flight. A high number of goals from crossed set-pieces speaks partly of organisational issues but also comes down to the fact that this ball can reliably be placed on a sixpence. “The football might be more acceptable to the players than the goalkeepers,” El Hadary conceded, and perhaps that is the best indicator that all is, in fact, as it should be. Nick AmesVideo Assistant Refereeing is proving more isive than decisive with nations asking Fifa for clarification on why VAR wasn’t used in certain situations. England were bemused as to why VAR wasn’t invoked when Harry Kane twice appeared to be rugby tackled in the box. There is clearly some ironing out to be done but in one department it is seemingly exerting a positive influence. It took until the 15th game of the tournament for the first red card to be issued, for Colombia’s Carlos Sánchez. That is the cleanest start to a World Cup since 1986. Martha KelnerIf only football was as easy as throwing together the best pieces and expecting them to fit into an instant jigsaw. France came to Russia with a familiar set of expectations – excitement about the talent pool tempered by doubts about how efficiently they would be used. Didier Deschamps was bold in moulding his team around the selection of three attackers who are all blessed with pace and trickery. In theory, who would want to play against Kylian Mbappé, Antoine Griezmann and Ousmane Dembélé? But in practice it didn’t quite work out. The chemistry was not immediate. The front players were often difficult to find, with a big space between them and the midfield. France did not attack with verve in their opening game against Australia and there is still work to do if this team is to find the right balance and bring out the best in itself. Amy LawrenceWithout wishing to tempt fate, it is starting to feel like the tournament will pass without all the obvious concerns - racism and the kind of violence that was seen in Euro 2016 - embarrassing Russia and scarring the competition. The only issue in the England camp so far are the swarms of bugs. And the biggest danger in Repino seems to be the wild dogs that roam in the woodlands. One member of the media entourage, cycling inland from England’s base, encountered a pack of them and was pursued for two miles before reaching safety. Daniel TaylorGareth Southgate spoke about seeking to change the perception of English football on the eve of his side’s opening group game against Tunisia and, while it will take far more than a stoppage time win over the team ranked 21st in the world to achieve that lofty ambition, everything to date suggests he can succeed in that task. England so often lower the mood at major finals, either through stodgy football or general underachievement, but this group seem different. They have been a breath of fresh air to date, a team well aware of their shortcomings but completely convinced of their qualities. No team has created as many chances as they did in that first half in Volgograd, and the English had never previously scored a stoppage time winner in normal time at the World Cup. The vim and verve stems from the manager and the philosophy he has imposed. They feel like a side who can thrive in Russia. Dominic FifieldIt was only one lapse, and Tite, his players and the rest of Brazil’s 200 million-plus population continue to insist that Switzerland’s equaliser in Rostov on Sunday ought to have been disallowed for a push. But something shocking happened after the goal went in. Brazil went to pieces. All of a sudden, their control was gone for a period of about 15 minutes. It seemed to chime with how Brazil lives its football – via wild extremes of emotion. Tite would talk about anxiety, huge pressure and opening-night nerves and it was easy to recall how the Selecao have been tracked by tears and trauma at previous World Cups, not least the last one. Brazil stabilised and they threw everything at Switzerland during a chaotic finale only for the winner to elude them. Tite’s squad have the talent. The biggest battle they face could be with their internal equilibrium. David HytnerAs a gaggle of Russian, Serbian and Costa Rican fans walked down Molodogvardeyskaya Ulitsa, in the centre of Samara, someone produced a football. It was past midnight and everybody was making their way home after a long day that started in the stadium and finished with a viewing of Brazil v Switzerland in the FanZone. Any tiredness was forgotten as an impromptu match broke out in the street, its participants bridging language issues with a pass here and a trick there. Russia and Serbia do, in fairness, have a long-established relationship but the scene was typical of the friendships that have been formed in the more provincial cities. The appetite for cultural exchange has been heartfelt: Samara, to take one example, was a closed city until 1991 and there has been visible emotion at the sight of football’s biggest show, and its accompanying melange of international visitors, rolling into town. It is genuinely heartwarming to see this opportunity being grasped so firmly. Nick AmesA World Cup in Brazil was always going to be well-attended by the other South American countries for obvious reasons, but it has been truly remarkable to see supporters from that part of the World travelling to Russia in such huge numbers and, in the case of Saransk, pretty much taking over the city and the stadium. Peru, who are the eighth-best supported country at the World Cup according to the number of official tickets sold in each nation, made the Mordovia Arena feel like a home venue against Denmark on Saturday. And Colombia, who sold 65,234 official tickets for these finals, which is more than twice as many as England, did something similar at the same stadium for their match against Japan on Tuesday. Listening to the stories that fans tell, explaining the sacrifices they have made, it shines through that watching their national team play means a lot more to them than people in many other countries, in particular in Europe and including England.

Completely unmarked, the villain of the piece for Senegal’s second went some way towards redeeming himself with a free header past Khadim N’Diaye.86 min: Krychowiak’s goal comes moments after Sarr had taken a e in the Poland penalty area when Rybus slid in to tackle him. It was a scurrilous piece of play-acting from the cheeky Senegalese. Krychowiak scores with a header from a free-kick, but his effort is being referred to the VAR officials. It stands! 81 min: Sarr goes down “injured” and the referee tells him to get up. Seconds later, he’s managed to shake whatever was ailing him and picks up a pass and sprints into the Poland penalty area from the right flank. Rybus es in to ... oh, hold on.80 min: Poland’s reaction to going two down has been ... to do nothing. They’re plugging away with the same tactics that have served them so poorly for 80 minutes. “When things aren’t working you have to try to do something to change them,” says Ally McCoist. “Just go long for a few minutes, play it forward to Lewandowski. Just do something different.” 79 min: Senegal substitution: Moussa Konate on for Niang. Poland substitution: Dawid Kownacki on for Milik.74 min: Looking at a replay of Senegal’s second goal ... crikey, what a meltdown. From inside the Senegal half, on the edge of the centre-circle, Krychowiak hoisted a huge back-pass towards Wojciech Szczesney. Having just been waved back on to the pitch, Niang saw what was happening and sprinted towards the Poland penalty area.With Bednarek just sort of standing a couple of yards outside it waiting for Szczesny to claim the ball after haring out of his area, Niang darted between both Poles, flicked the ball goalwards and had the relatively straight forward task of advancing a few yards and scoring into an empty net while Szczesny and Bednarek stood glaring at each other and Krychowiak.72 min: Gueye is booked for a foul on Robert Lewandowski. Senegal substitution from just after they scored their second goal: Mama Biram Diouf off, Birmingham City’s Cheick Ndoye on.69 min: Piszczek drills a low cross to the near post, where Milik had found a pocket of space courtesy of a good run. He’s first to the ball but shoots the wrong side of the upright from four or five yards. 65 min: Poland’s players were complaining in the wake of that goal and I think it’s because Niang had left the field after suffering an injury and they believe he had either returned without the referee’s permission or come on in an advantageous position to make the most of Krychowiak’s tomfoolery. It seems the ref had waved him back on and after that it was just tough luck on Poland, who only have themselves to blame for that defensive calamity.62 min: Awful stuff from Poland. From the centre of the pitch and for reasons best known to himself, Krychowiak tries to loft a 50 yard pass back to his own goalkeeper. His pass drops woefully short and with Niang and Szczesny both charging at the ball from opposite directions, the Senegal wins it and has the straightforward task of shooting into an empty net. Bednarek could have done better too, but looked powerless to stop Niang as he raced Szczesny to the ball.A hideous mistake by Krychowiack gifts Senegal a second goal.58 min: “Everything looks a struggle! Everything looks a struggle!” says Ally McCoist to Jon Champion on the UK coverage of this game, upon asked for his thoughts on how Poland are doing. The pair make for a very entertaining duo and have just been laughing at their discovery that former Senegal, Liverpool, Bolton and Rangers player El-Hadji Diouf now works in Dakar as a government goodwill ambassador. “There’s hope for us all,” chuckles Ally.56 min: Poland are playing with a bit more urgency in this second half, but have yet to create a chance of note from open play. They do so as I type - with Rybus sending an inviting cross to the back post, where it drops invitingly for Lukasz Piszczek. He sidefoots an atrocious volley well wide of the upright. 54 min: Lewandowski is penalised for a foul on Ismaila Sarr as the pair tussle for the ball down by the byline to the right of the Senegal goal.50 min: SAVED!!! Lewandowski takes the free-kick and it’s a good one – on target, but lacking that bit of zip which might have taken it past Khadim N’Diaye in the Senegal goal.49 min: Lewandowski wins the ball on the halfway line and gallops forward. He’s brought down illegally by Salif Sane on the edge of the Senegal penalty area and the Senegal centre-back gets a yellow card. Free-kick for Poland, a yard or two from the D on the Senegal penalty area.46 min: Jan Bednarek, who plays for Southampton, looks badly hurt after his collision with Youssouf-Sabaly but is up and looking alert after receiving treatment. He’s on for Kuba Blaszczykowski, which is good news for those of us who type minute-by-minute reports for a living. 46 min: This match seems to be getting a bad press on Twitter, which is obviously the most accurate barometer of informed public opinion we have, but I’ve found it quite entertaining so far. Sadio Mane has been fairly quiet, as has Poland’s most creative player, Piotr Zielinski. Robert Lewandowski had little or no service in that first half.Play resumes, with Bednarek on for Poland. He’s immediately clattered in an accidental collision.Peeep! The players troop off for their half-time cuppa, with Senegal leading by the only goal of the game. It’s been entertaining enough, but far from a classic. Thiago Cionek’s own-goal separates the sides the Polish central defender was helpless to do much about it after Idrissa Gueye’s low drive went in off his shin after 37 minutes.45 min: We’re into added time at the end of the first half. There’s a touch of England-against-Tunisia about Poland’s performance - they’re looking toothless up front and lacking that little bit of creative flair in midfield that might cause Senegal problems.44 min: The clock ticks towards half-time with Senegal continuing to dominate. Krychowiak is penalised for a foul ion Idrissa Gueye about 10 yards inside the Poland half. He’s already on a yellow card and can count himself extremely lucky not to have got a second one for that late tackle.41 min: Senegal corner. The ball’s floated into the mixer and burley Senegal centre-back defender Salif Sane leaps highest. He doesn’t make decent contact with the ball and admonishes himself in the strongest possible terms after heading the ball straight into the ground. He should have scored there.40 min: Fifa’s boffins have decreed that Gueye’s shot was going narrowly wide before it was deflected, so Senegal’s opener will officially go down as a Thiago Cionek own-goal. 38 min: Dearie me, how’s your luck? Senegal take the lead through a deflected goal. Mane squared the ball for Idrissa Gueye several yards outside the penalty area and the Everton man took a shot. His low drive took a deflection off Cionek and went into the bottom right-hand corner with goalkeeper Szczesny hopelessly wrong-footed.36 min: Theres a break in play as both Sarr and Kuba receive treatment from their respective medical teams. 33 min: Now Niang gets down the right flank and squares the ball for Diouf. He leaps to head goalwards, but is flagged for offside. 32 min: Ismaila Sarr gets down the inside right for Senegal again and squares the ball, but it’s cleared.28 min: Not so much end to end as box to box for the past few minutes, in a game that is very open ... up to a point. Both sides look fairly evenly matched, but good chances have been conspicuous by their absence. On the UK Coverage, Allly McCoist is on co-comms duty and is currently bemoaning the lack of movement from the attacking players of both sides. “Maybe they’re showing each other a bit too much respect,” he muses, as he points to the reluctance of the full-backs of both sides to get forward. 25 min: Senegal go on the attack again, a series of slick passes coming to an end when Mama Biram Diouf is unable to control a clever Niang pass into the penalty area. 23 min: Kuba takes a poor first touch on the edge of the Senegal penalty area and goes down looking for a free-kick. The ball breaks to Lewandowski, with his back to goal. He swivels and shoots, but doesn’t get hold of the ball properly. Wide.20 min: Poland attack and Krychowiak tries a shot from distance. It’s deflected towards Piotr Zielinski, who is on the stretch and unable to control his header on goal properly.

They deserved this win even if the critical breakthrough came courtesy of a lot of luck, an own goal by Fathi. Egypt were also cursed by Salah’s shoulder injury: he was said to be fit enough to start and he did his best but he was clearly still hampered by the injury he suffered in the Champions League final. That did not stop him from scoring but by then it was too late. Russia may not be teeming with ingenuity but they do have some dinky players - Zobnin was particularly impressive in midfield today - and play with great vibrancy. And they’ve scored eight goals in two matches. They won’t be easy opponents for anyone. Egypt, meanwhile, look certain to be eliminated by at least they could register their first ever World Cup win when they face Saudi Arabia in their last game.90+3 min: Hamed tries a bang from distance. It doesn’t even make it into the box. It’s not going to happened for Egypt. The Russian crowd are preparing for a party ...90+1 min: Egypt have at least three more minutes in which to produce a miracle.90 min: Egypt continue to pour forward. Salah is at the hub of all their moves even though he’s clearly not fully fit. Warda tries to set up a grandstand finish by blasting into the net from the edge of the box. But he bogs it way wide.88 min: A splendid tackle by Hamed on Samedox saves Egypt - the Russian was about to shoot from close range.87 min: Warda fires in a dangerous cross after more positive play by Egypt. The cross is cleared. But the way Egypt have played since going 3-0 down reinforces the wish that Cuper had been more bold from the start of this tournament.83 min: Egypt are pushing hard for another goal. But Russia are defending well and the threat of a counter-attack is always there.80 min: Superb tackle by Zobnin on Fathi deep in his own territory. It lays the ground for another Russia raid and they hurtle forward with venom. But they stop short of shooting when they get to the Egyptian box, preferring to retain possession.78 min: Egypt appeal for another penalty as Mohsen goes down in the box under pressure from Kutepov. This time the ref gets it right, waving away the pleas because it was Mohsen who grabbed the defender’s shirt first.77 min: Golovin traps the ball beautifully and then nudges it past Gabr and goes down in search of a freekick. The ref isn’t buying it. 75 min: Samedov sends a freekick from the right beyond the back post. Ignashevich hads goalward. But Elshenawy saves.Salah has made his mark on this World Cup! A fine penalty, hammered high into the net. But it’s too late for Egypt. Or is it?72 min: Salah is fouled in the box after a one-two with Sobhi, his arm pulled back. The ref blows ... and awards freekick outside the area! It’s clearly inside and VAR will surely confirm that. It does! Salah will seek to do justice from the spot ...70 min: Said ks a 25-yard shot high over the bar. 69 min: Ignashevich is caught out at the back but Salah reprieves him by failing to get the ball under control. He really hasn’t been himself today and it’s a darned shame. 67 min: Salah slips a nice pass to Trezeguet, who essays a dainty sidefooter from the edge of the area. It’s a fine efforts but goes a yard wide. 65 min: The result seems certain now but that doesn’t mean there’s no more intrigue: the big remaining question is whether Igor Akinfeev, who went 11 years without keeping a clean sheet in the Champions League, can keep consecutive clean sheets in the World Cup?63 min: Egypt try to salvage some pride, sending a long freekick into the Russian box. Gabr heads wide from 16 yards.What a goal! The hosts are on easy street now. The big striker took a long punt down on his chest at the edge of the area, turned and walloped a low shot into the net. Brilliant targetman play!Now that’s a fine goal! Fernandes made it with a burst down the right, a clever shimmy and a nice pull back. Cheryshev sidefoots it low into the net from seven yards. The Pharaoahs are going to need a wonder of the world to recover from here. 55 min: Trezeguet flicks a header on to Salah about 15 yards out. Salah’s first touch isn’t as sharp as it might have been, and his second is a shot that’s blocked. Russia clear the ensuing corner under duress. Salah isn’t quite himself today. He seems hesitant and seem unsure his shoulder can withstand serious contact or even sudden twists. It’s a real pity.53 min: Gabr neads a Zhirkov cross behind at the near post. Samedov delivers the corner. Egypt head it out for another one. Samedov delivers again, and this time Egypt clear well.51 min: Trezeguet turns sharply past Fernandes on the right and scoots towards the byline. But then he mis-hits his cross. 48 min: Looking back at the goal, it’s clear that Elshenaway could have avoided it if he had caught the cross rather than punched it. It was at a convenient height and not especially hard. As for Fathi, he was off-balance after stepping in front of Dzyuba, which is why he ended up erting the ball the wrong way. Russia have the lead thanks to a monumental fluke! Elshenawy punched away a cross from the right. Zobnin tried to sent it back towards goal from 25 yards but he miscued his shot, which starts veering wide. Fathi tries to welly it back upfield but, under pressure from Dzyuba, he shanks it backwards into his own goal! It’s a catastrophe for the defender but Russia’s don’t care: they and their fans celebrate deliriously!46 min: Within second of the resumption, Trezeguet collapses after being caught accidentally by Dzyuba’s flailing arm as he challenged for an aerial ball. No serious harm done, though.That was an entertaining first half, frenetic and very open. Both teams have attacked at every opportunity and although there’s been a lack of ingenuity and also of really clear chances, it’s been kind of gripping. And it can only get better in the second period because both teams could do with the win: Russia won’t be particularly keen on going into their final game needing a result against Uruguay, with Egypt to face Saudi Arabia. Salah has not been playing at full throttle but has looked dangerous on a couple of occasions.42 min: Abdelshafy fizzes a low pass to Salah at the edge of the area. Pestered by Zhirkov, he swivels and sweeps a left-footed shot just wide! 41 min: Samedov curls another corner towards Dzyuba, who wins the header but can’t direct it on to the target.39 min: Russia attack .. until one of their passes in midfield hits the referee and rebounds to ... Salah! He immediately started zooming forward as Russians charge hastily back. Salah then offloads and the move concludes with Elneny floating a cross towards Mohsen, whose soft header is easily saved.36 min: Gazinskii drifts a deep cross from the right towards Dzyuba. Elshenawy takes command of the situation, striding off his line and catching before the striker even jumped. Then he flings the ball out to Salah ... who gives it away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54b0aa823e878d514ebaf4feae8e24cebba92f37/119_1185_860_516/master/860.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8415702cc963456ed2cc79033e6342b9","title":"image sobbing toddler us border it was hard for me to photograph john moore","story":"The photographer behind the viral image that exposed the anguish of Trump’s controversial border policy speaks outPhotographer John Moore, whose viral image of a weeping two-year-old girl at the US border has become the potent symbol of the outrage over Donald Trump’s controversial “zero tolerance” policy, including family separations, knew what he had captured was “important”.What he could not guess, however, was how great an impact his picture would have on the debate as it was published around the globe.Moore, a veteran Getty Images photographer, who has spent a decade documenting immigration and US border issues, had been accompanying a patrol along the Rio Grande Valley.Over the years, Moore had become familiar with both the routes over this border and the way different people reacted: how those who crossed inidually, usually men, would run and try to hide from the border patrols. Many families, tired from their often weeks-long journey, would seek to surrender almost immediately to the officers whom they encountered.Night had fallen and Moore was waiting in the scrub by the riverside for rafts carrying undocumented migrants, when the sound of four boats and a dozen people became audible. Those crossing were arrested almost immediately by border officers.And unlike those in the boat, Moore knew what was likely to happen.“I have photographed many immigrant families seeking political asylum at the border over the last few years. “I am sure that most of these families had no idea of the new US policy to separate children from their parents during the immigration court proceedings. “I knew, however, what would happen to many of them next – separation – after they were taken away, so it was difficult for me to witness.Each of the adults was frisked before being loaded into a van to take them to a processing centre, he said.“One of the last in line was the mother with her daughter. I had spoken with her briefly and she said she was from Honduras and that she and her two-year-old had been traveling for a month to reach the US border. “The officer asked her to put the little girl on the ground while the mother was searched. Once on the ground the young girl immediately started crying. “As a photojournalist covering this story for years, and as the father of three children, including a toddler, it was personally very hard for me to photograph. Very quickly the two were then bundled into the transport van, and it was over. I had to take a few deep breaths, as it was emotional for me to see.”In the context of the debate that has convulsed US politics since the Trump administration’s policy of separating children from their parents at the border has been thrust into the spotlight – attracting criticism even from high profile Republicans and former first lady Laura Bush – Moore knew what he was seeing would have resonance.“I knew that this image was important. There was no way for me to know just how much so,” he said, in the midst of back-to-back interviews with US networks and other media outlets.“For me, it’s both gratifying to make photographs that matter, and saddening to witness. As a photojournalist who has worked in difficult disaster and conflict zones for many years, that conflict of emotion never really goes away.“I have always tried to humanise this broad and complex story that is often told with statistics. So, with the photos of the young girl and her mother, I hope I achieved that to some extent. People remember the photos that make them feel.”He added: “Photojournalists and reporters alike, we all want to make a difference with the work that we do. Some images have a unique power to break through the collective dissonance. Much of the time, however, even when we do our very best, our work often has limited impact on government policies. This image has energised the American public on the issue of the separation of families and touched many people emotionally. I hope it helps to change policy.”For now, however, Moore would like to know what has happened to the little girl and her mother. “US Customs and Border Protection have not been forthcoming on their status so far. I would love to know where they are and how they are doing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/089bc2ae29717f919a0e29a90576ca161e1af7cd/0_334_3877_2326/master/3877.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b3a1165fc8a6b68a9e2ac5de609c899","title":"from overnight oats to boiled eggs is meal prep taking the joy out of eating","story":"Loved by fitness fanatics, the thrifty and eco-warriors, there are now 8m posts of pre-prepared meals on Instagram, arrayed in rows of colourful Tupperware. But is it good for you?The relationship between food and social media was once straightforward. Those were the innocent days when no meal could be declared consumed unless it had also been photographed, filtered and posted on Instagram, when the world seemed merely a stage for avocado toast, açai bowls and barista art. It was a different time – a time before meal prep.While meal prep has long existed, of course, it has grown in popularity over the past six years, aided by Instagram, where there are 8m posts with the hashtag #mealprep. Most show a variety of meals prepared for the week ahead – quinoa salads, chicken rice bowls, carrot sticks, broccoli florets, hulled strawberries – all displayed in a selection of artfully photographed Tupperware-style containers.Behind the glamour of such posts, meal prep is a simple concept: set aside a day of the week to prepare the bare bones of your meals for the following week, then store it in containers in your freezer or refrigerator until its allotted day. The theory is that it saves time in the busy midweek when the idea of cooking from scratch feels draining. It also saves money by encouraging home cooking and reduces food and packaging waste. It is favoured by those who wish to control portion size and calorie consumption and those following, say, a high-protein diet. In short, it is beloved by fitness fanatics, the financially thrifty, the environmentally minded, the nutritionally conscious and, of course, wellness bloggers.King came across meal prep six years ago, before he worked in fitness, while taking part in a shoot for Men’s Health magazine. “I was working with a trainer and meal prep has been a long-running thing with people who train,” he says. “He told me about prepping chicken, protein shakes, boiled eggs. It was so boring and bland, but it was the first time I did it and it was like: ‘Wow, it really is important to know these things if you want to be goal-specific.’ Diet is absolutely key when it comes to the whole shebang of keeping fit and meal prep makes it one more thing not to worry about.”These days, King goes “in and out” of meal prep. He has a base level of fitness and a breadth of nutritional knowledge that allows him to be a little more relaxed. But when he has a particular need to be at his physical peak he returns to a meal-prepping regime. “I’ve got a photoshoot in about three weeks’ time for my online coaching service, so in about a week, when I get back from Ibiza, I’ll be getting my containers out,” he says. “I’ll have two weeks of being very disciplined. I hate the word diet, but I batten down the hatches and focus on fueling my body the best way I can.”For King, and most meal preppers, work begins at the weekend. “I always recommend to clients that Sunday is a great day to get organised for the week ahead,” he says. “It stimulates the brain. You can spend an afternoon on the sofa refreshing your phone or going down the pub, but what about going to the market, the fishmonger, the butcher, planning your week, working within a budget, thinking about packaging?”He has a few tricks: “How you can make 30 mini omelettes in a mini-muffin tray, how you can cook eggs in bulk in an oven, how roughly two skewers would be enough protein for a meal, how blanching broccoli means it won’t go soggy after a couple of days,” he says. “You can be efficient and productive about it, but you can also make an afternoon out of it – work with your partner, put some music on.” The containers are essential. “There are many different sizes, with different compartments, which helps portion control,” King explains. “So you can weigh out X grams of meat or veg or salad.”Showing off our food is nothing new – think of the Victoria sponges, raspberry jams and prize onions of a village fete, of buffet spreads and the relentless peacocking of dinner parties. “We always have a Martha Stewart impulse in a society – we want to make something and we want to show everyone we made it and it looks great,” Elias says. “People will do that for ever and always have. But Instagram adds another level.”This is the strange puzzle of meal prep. On the one hand, it appears another symptom of an ostentatious, aesthetically preoccupied age, in which one cannot simply eat healthily, but must do so in a way that is meticulously curated and visually pleasing and then posted about on the internet. On the other, there is something so curiously old-fashioned here – a return to the culture of the weekly shop, the rhythm of meal planning and home cooking – that it is hard not to view it as a reaction to the age of instant gratification, a rejection of the world in which every kind of cuisine is available to us at any hour of the day.It is striking how many men have embraced the trend. “It’s part of a larger shift in masculinity and part of the de-industrialisation of society,” says Elias. “Manliness is uncoupled from manual labour. And, since the 80s, cooking has been a thing that both men and women can be impressed by. So, men are now cooking. But, of course, they take it over and it becomes competitive.” For those who can find neither time nor inclination to spend their Sundays slaving over a hot mini-muffin tray, there is the promise of a meal-prep delivery service, where all the chopping, dicing, measuring and boxing has been done for you.The biggest of these is HelloFresh, which launched in the UK six and a half years ago and now has 1.9 million customers worldwide. Co-founder Patrick Drake says the company ascertained that it was “all the stuff before cooking” that put off people who felt they could not cook or did not like cooking. “It was the meal planning, the trudging to the supermarket, the buying ingredients in bulk that never get used up,” says Drake. What meal-prep delivery gave them, he argues, “was a feeling of achievement” untouched by ready meals or takeaway. “The slightly intangible thing is that little moment of victory when they stand back and say: ‘I made that!’ It’s a satisfying thing to take raw ingredients and turn them into a beautiful meal.”For all its peculiarities and showiness, #mealprep might serve as “a bridge for people who didn’t grow up cooking”, says Elias. King agrees: “If you’ve fallen out of touch with how food is made, meal prep can help you find it again.”Even those who have made a career exploring the sensuous pleasures of food are not necessarily horrified by the trend. “It’s sort of Lego cooking, isn’t it?” says the food writer and Great British Menu judge Matthew Fort. “But anything that encourages people to cook meals from scratch must be a good thing. It’s also a useful way, if that’s your bent of mind, to control how much you eat and your calorie intake – though I personally find that rather depressing.”King encourages prospective meal preppers to ignore the pressures of social media hashtags. “Don’t be one of these Instagram-happy people with their overnight oats,” he laughs. “Not everyone has the time, money and energy to do it like that. I think food is something that should be enjoyed it’s important not to get bogged down by it.”Some degree of meal prep can, however, play a role in regaining a heathy relationship with eating. “It’s common for those with eating disorders as part of their recovery to have input from a dietician or a trained professional and to have meal plans as part of quite a structured approach,” Quinn says. “For people with eating disorders, there can be some anxiety around spontaneous approaches to eating – for example, going to a restaurant where you don’t know the menu. So, some structured plan over a week, where you know this is what you are going to be eating and these are the ingredients, can be helpful. But this is only done with support and guidance with a trained professional. We would never recommend just going on to Instagram and seeing what someone else’s meal plan is.”I traipse through the internet in search of meal prep ideas: pretty mason jars filled with layers of fruit and granola, black rice sushi rolls, sweet potato chunks held in airtight plastic containers in shades of sapphire and frosted crystal. It is a world that seems potentially bright and crisp and exciting.At some point, I follow a link to a story about a woman in Australia who preps a month’s worth of family breakfasts and lunches in just four hours for approximately $60 (£34), but when I look at the pictures I feel crestfallen by their beigeness: puff pastry pinwheels, cheese sandwiches, containers of macaroni cheese. This, I suspect, is the more prosaic reality of meal prep.I think of something Fort said when we discussed the trend’s potential drawbacks. “The only major criticism is that it removes the instinctive and creative part of cooking,” he says. “What seems a brilliant idea when you plan on a Sunday night might seem rather less desirable when you get to a damp, cold, wet Thursday. For me, part of the pleasure of cooking is the instinctive response to ingredients, of looking at something and thinking: ‘Ah! What shall I do with that?’ And so, for me, it might be a little sterile. Because the idea of eating for pleasure, for joy, for happiness, a sense of community, seems a pity to lose.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ade4419ee3c19292d3990f74a4a645efca3337ed/0_11_999_599/master/999.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=190b9331b34036033fcd4091e1dd7eef","title":"beyond poppies six things you didnt know about the royal british legion","story":"From supporting veterans in emergency situations to providing breaks for service families, Legion initiatives offer a vital helping hand to serving and former members of the armed forcesBeing a member of the armed forces can be high risk and many personnel leave with life-changing injuries. The Royal British Legion provides high quality recovery and rehabilitation support to ex-service personnel who find themselves wounded, injured, sick, or who are experiencing multiple challenges such as being out of work, dealing with mental health problems, financial issues and alcohol abuse.The programme’s flagship is the £27m Battle Back Centre at Lilleshall in the West Midlands, which provides sports and adventure activities designed to promote self-confidence and improve motivation to aid recovery. Tailored programmes help the wounded cope with both physical and psychological challenges.For most, leaving the armed forces means starting a completely new career. The Legion offers a wide range of services designed to help ex-service men and women find employment including Civvy Street – a dedicated website, which lists job vacancies and provides online training resources and information on changing careers. The Legion can also provide funding for additional training or education through its employment support grant scheme.Anyone planning on starting a business will also be supported in their ambition. The Legion provides guidance on business plans, finances and tax requirements. Specialist assistance is also available to put together a business plan, source funding and even find mentors.Not everyone is a DIY whiz and not all former members of the services are equipped to tackle repair jobs. However, rather than booking a handyman, The Royal British Legion provides a handy van service across 21 counties to help with minor home adaptations and repairs for older or less able veterans and their families. The fully trained team assists with maintenance round the home – covering everything from putting up shelves and grab rails to building access ramps and storage sheds to provide shelter for personal mobility vehicles.They can also install the Legion’s system of care phones. A type of personal alarm, a care phone is a telephone-based unit worn on a user’s wrist or neck that can be used to summon help in an emergency.It can be tough and stressful for families and children of those serving in the armed forces. Often some light relief can make a real difference, but taking a much-needed holiday can prove difficult for those on a tight budget. The Legion provides a range of welfare services including week-long adventure breaks for children. These breaks offer a great opportunity for youngsters to have fun, make new friends, have new experiences and improve their self-esteem while giving parents a well-earned break.Parents are not left out either. Week-long breaks for service families are offered at four Legion centres in traditional British seaside resorts during the Easter, summer and October school holidays. Guests are free to take in the sea air while exploring the coast or visiting local tourist attractions. The breaks offer rest and recuperation for people recovering from life-changing events such as illness or bereavement.In the UK today, one in six people over 80 has dementia and by 2025 more than a million people could have the condition. Inevitably, former members of the services feature in these figures. The Royal British Legion provides care in the shape of its purpose built dementia wings at four of its six residential care homes in Somerset, Warwickshire, Norfolk and north Yorkshire, as well as specialist, admiral nurses – developed in partnership with Dementia UK – who work in the community. Currently operating in Lancashire, the west Midlands, Hampshire and Somerset, admiral nurses offer specialist support, information and advice to the family carers of people living with dementia within the armed forces community.Leaving the armed forces means having to deal with an array of financial issues that can be confusing if you’re not prepared for them. Bring in The Royal British Legion’s team of benefits and money advisers. This financial team provides support and guidance in the event ex-service people and their families suffer money problems or need guidance to help set up a new home or access benefits. It also provides help with debt and other unexpected crises, plus support through grants.The Legion has set up MoneyForce, a dedicated website designed to improve understanding of financial issues with information on essentials such as interest charges or buying a home. Managed in partnership with the Ministry of Defence and Standard Life Charitable Trust, the scheme has saved beneficiaries £70m through increases in benefits, tax credits, writing off debts and gaining grants since it began in 2007. It gives ex-service men and women the skills they need to manage their money, smoothing the transition to civilian life.To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15ef6fe4450a7e99b3a72f4e7ea3552214cf10b3/0_153_2799_1679/master/2799.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5c23e9345f63d34c0f2c02fb7b9c098","title":"from medical discharge to the london marathon one military couples story of resilience","story":"When Mike Kiff was discharged from the army, chronic pain and depression threatened to end his marriage, but with support from The Royal British Legion he and his wife have rebuilt their life togetherIn 2005, Cpl Mike Kiff fell from a roof and dislocated his shoulder badly while on active duty. The injury required surgery but seemed unlikely to curtail a career in the armed forces.Although it was never quite right after the incident, he continued in his role. Then, one day in 2014, while serving in Kabul, Afghanistan, he reached for his rifle and felt a blinding pain in the same shoulder. The pins that were holding it together had been ripped out, tearing tendons and fracturing the bone.“In my mind I knew it was all over then, the pain was so severe I couldn’t breathe,” he recalls of the incident. “Things went downhill from there.”He attempted to continue his job, but after a few weeks Kiff’s senior officer made it clear he was in no position to function effectively in what was a war zone. He was flown back to his base in Germany where he found his problems shelved as the rest of the regiment began a move back to the UK. The injury also meant that a pending promotion was off the table because he was now considered unfit for duty. Serious injury often signals the end of a career in the armed forces but making the transition back to civilian life can be a very difficult process for both the service person affected and their family.With little external support and constant chronic pain he began to sink into severe depression, which soon had an impact on his relationship.“I knew Mike was struggling badly from the calls we had when he was in Afghanistan, but when he returned to base it began to fall apart almost from the moment he walked through the door. He was no longer the same man who had gone away,” says wife Linda. The couple had met while Mike was on leave in Bournemouth, married in 2006 and have two children.As the barracks emptied out around them, their problems were low priority. However, Mike had some good fortune when a medical officer recommended a break at Brydon House, a recently opened personnel recovery centre that had received major funding from The Royal British Legion.“I had physiotherapy, received specialist counselling and found people who were prepared to listen to my problems. It was a completely different level of support, a hundred times better,” he says.After a lengthy recovery process, Mike was medically discharged and the family returned to Bournemouth from Germany. Unfortunately, their problems worsened. They found themselves homeless and were forced to move in with Linda’s parents. Meanwhile, Mike was jobless, in severe pain and on antidepressants. Linda took a job working nights. Their relationship deteriorated rapidly.“I had no one to turn to,” says Linda. “I’m Mike’s support system, of course, so I took the brunt of it. He was jobless for a year and I was working full time. Our roles changed completely, which only added to the stress. It wasn’t a healthy situation but I discovered I could also get support from the Legion. Until then I thought they were just fundraisers.“They advised me to adapt my thought process towards him. I talked to them on a number of occasions and they were always a huge help. We had hit a wall in our marriage and their support was crucial to us getting through it.”“My issues had begun to affect our relationship and we were struggling,” agrees Mike. “The Legion were there to support us. We were both able to talk to people about what was going on. I was able to get anything from a sympathetic ear to practical financial guidance and help finding a job. Linda got advice about how to manage me because I was depressed and angry.”Slowly, with support from the Legion, the couple have rebuilt their lives. Mike now works as a civilian instructor teaching fibre optics to military personnel and Linda has a job in retail. Mike is still on medication and has good days and bad, but knows he can always pick up the phone and talk to someone.In 2017 the couple ran the London Marathon to raise funds for the organisation. “It was a way of saying thank you and having a common goal also helped reconnect us,” says Mike. “I think it’s safe to say we’d probably be orced without them and if that had happened I don’t know what would have happened to me. It would have been the final straw.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd9b0086b181548bd323ca738abff8b831cd9a3b/0_210_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0aa9bb2d8930295ed85386d22b40d55","title":"how one marine lost his dream job but found meaning helping other veterans","story":"When a freak injury ended marine Nick Fleming’s chances of ever seeing active deployment, he left the services unsure of what to do next. But it wasn’t long before The Royal British Legion answered that question for himNick Fleming had always wanted to be a marine. After joining the service in February 2014, and enduring eight months of gruelling training, he was devastated when his career came to end because of a knee injury. The fact that it happened while on a rugby league pitch, rather than during deployment, added insult to injury. “It was my dream job,” he says. “To have it taken out from under my feet before it even got started was a pretty tough one to take.”The 28-year-old had been posted to Plymouth as part of the Royal Marines’ 42 Commando unit and would spend two years in rehabilitation, undergoing a number of operations to try and repair the damage. Eventually, under his surgeon’s advice, he had to admit defeat and accept that he wouldn’t be able to continue as a Royal Marine . He was medically discharged in October 2017 – only three and a half years after he’d joined the service. “One of the top knee surgeons in the south west said it was time to rethink my career. I potentially could have stayed on as a clerk or in the store, but it’s not really what I joined up to do. So it was decided I’d leave.” For service men and women who leave the forces, adjusting to civilian life can be a challenge. Fleming admits he didn’t really know what he wanted to do after he left the marines. “I had no clear direction,” he says, but decided to move to London to be with his girlfriend. He had come across The Royal British Legion while in rehabilitation, attending the charity’s Battle Back Centre in Lilleshall, which supports sick and injured armed forces personnel. While there, he took part in indoor climbing and golf sessions, and completed a wheelchair basketball coaching qualification. In London, he saw a job advert for an advice and information officer at the Legion’s Pop-In Centre and applied. He now helps others make the same transition as he did, and offers welfare support to the armed forces community as needed. Working in an office has been a real culture change, but he admits he’s found the work really rewarding. “We were able to talk to him, find him accommodation, get him a deposit and kit out the property. We gave him a fresh start and took that worry off him, so he could start getting his life back together.”Many of the charity’s beneficiaries are dealing with mental health issues, often related to their time in the services. Fleming has completed a mental health first aid course with the Legion to help those who come through the centre’s doors. The other common issue is accommodation – particularly in London. Some of the men and women leaving the service won’t have a plan in place for where they’re going to live afterwards and will panic about leaving it to the last minute. The Legion can help with finding somewhere suitable, offering grants for deposits or furnishings, or with filling out benefit forms. Fleming can also signpost beneficiaries to other services, such as counselling and physiotherapy. For him, the most challenging part of his work is learning to deal with the stress and responsibility of other people’s problems. Golf, which he was introduced to at the Battle Back Centre while in rehabilitation, has become an important coping mechanism.“Not only am I coming to terms with losing my career and moving to London, trying to find somewhere to live, all of that stuff, but you’re also picking up other people’s issues, which are constantly going through your mind,” he says. “Golf sounds really boring but if I need to unwind, that’s what I’ll go and do.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/220cc2c15ead83cf112040227ffb90a6efb3859c/0_199_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d111d29b72bbb9d173e58a1ad56bde7","title":"rupert murdoch must increase sky news budget to 100m","story":"Culture secretary says Sky takeover requires 15-year commitment to news unitRupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox must must increase the funding of Sky News to at least £100m a year beyond 2030 as a precondition of taking full control of Sky, the culture secretary has said.Hancock’s condition means that Fox will have to top up any shortfall in funding to keep Sky News’s budget at £100m for the next 15 years.Hancock also said on Tuesday that if Disney buys Sky News it must commit to operate and maintain the news unit for at least 15 years. During that period, Fox will cover any shortfall from a £100m budget. If Disney ultimately proves to be the new owner of Sky News – Hancock has said the news unit could also be sold to an “alternative suitable buyer” – it will not be allowed to sell it for 15 years unless the culture secretary approves a deal.A Fox spokeswoman said: “21st Century Fox welcomes today’s announcement by the secretary of state for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport that he intends to accept the final undertakings proposed by Fox and Disney with a view to clearing 21CF’s proposed acquisition of the remaining shares in Sky on media plurality grounds. We now look forward to a final decision clearing our transaction.”Hancock has launched a 15-day consultation on whether the undertakings will solve public interest concerns that taking full control of Sky, and with it Sky News, would give Murdoch too much power over UK news media. On Wednesday, 21st Century Fox’s board is to meet to discuss a rival $65bn (£49.3bn) bid for its assets – including the Sky stake – from US cable and entertainment group Comcast. There is speculation that the board may decide to withdraw its recommendation for the bid from Disney, which is expected to table a more lucrative deal to try to see off Comcast.Separately, in April Comcast launched a £22bn bid directly for Sky, which has been given conditional clearance by the government. Comcast, which has 1,300 employees in the UK in subsidiaries including the production company behind Downton Abbey, made a number of pledges at the time of the Sky bid, such as keeping Sky’s HQ in Osterley, south-west London, and guaranteeing the editorial independence and funding of Sky News for at least 10 years.“We are determined to be responsible and trusted owners of Sky,” Brian Roberts, the chair and chief executive of Comcast, said. “We understand and appreciate the value of news and are committed to protecting the important role that Sky News plays in providing a high-quality impartial news service. Any news organisation needs to have independence and be protected to do its job. You want there to be independence.”If Murdoch disposes of his entertainment assets he would be left owning a much smaller Fox business which would control a TV network and news channels including the rightwing Fox News, in addition to Dow Jones which runs the Wall Street Journal and publisher HarperCollins.In the UK he would be left with his News UK business, which owns the Sun and the Times newspaper."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd7e81978bc657b6157990623104b464e26f9f24/0_351_1717_1030/master/1717.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1314bb7bf9b9c0abf51e0298e9c0a71c","title":"nina simone home national treasure north carolina recognition legacy","story":"The recognition of the singer’s North Carolina home as a national treasure marks another step in reassessing her remarkable career Nina Simone always felt underappreciated during her lifetime. She had a right to. After 1960, her albums never put more than a dent in the lower end of the pop charts. And her singles made no greater impression. More, the press, the industry and even some audiences found her uncompromising performances and adamant character either off-putting or baffling.Thankfully, time has a way of correcting such perceptions. Over the last three years, there’s been an escalating appreciation not only of Nina Simone’s depth of talent, but of her defiant character. Attention for her work has been greatly amplified by Liz Garbus’s unflinching 2015 documentary, What Happened, Miss Simone?, as well as her richly deserved induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame this year.Today, another step in her reassessment takes place. Simone’s childhood home has been named a national treasure by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. Fewer than 100 homes in the US have earned that designation. The organization, joined by the World Monuments Fund and other groups, plans to turn the now vacant and dilapidated property, located in Tryon, North Carolina, into a salute to the artist’s legacy. Today a series of events will occur around the house where Nina Simone taught herself to play piano, and where she grew up experiencing the severe restrictions of the Jim Crow south. To honor those events, there’s a deep catalogue of Simone’s work available to savor on every streaming service.Between 1958 and 1993, the singer, who died in 2003 at 70, released more than 60 live and studio albums, mainly containing cover versions of other people’s songs. Yet, the arrangements Simone created, informed by her classical training, and the phrasing of her vocals, drawn from jazz, rewrote the compositions in her own image. Some recordings, like her cover of Leonard Cohen’s Suzanne, differ so radically from the original, she deserved a co-writing credit.Some of the pieces Simone composed herself became classics, including her blunt response to the violence of the civil rights era south in Mississippi Goddam, and the pride anthem To Be Young, Gifted and Black. Over the years, Simone’s politics became increasingly radical. By the late 60s, she had no trouble asking black audiences if they were “ready to kill” for the cause – a quote captured in Garbus’s movie. Small wonder, Simone later became a kind of godmother to gangsta rap’s hardest artists.Her work took just as unblinking a view of gender. With her deep pitch, she blurred expectations for male and female singers, providing a role model for later androgynous vocalists from Jeff Buckley to Anohni. Likewise, Simone’s recordings ignored isions between jazz, pop, rock, classical music and soul.Classical piano formed Nina Simone’s musical foundation. Originally, she didn’t even want to sing. She only began to, in the 1950s, because the nightclub owners she met wouldn’t book a woman who wasn’t a vocalist. The singing style she developed showed an incredible range, marked by fierce inflections and edgy enunciations. She turned each of her covers into a comment on the song as much as an embodiment of it. In her greatest performances, she obliterated the line between what she was feeling and what she could convey, gracing listeners with a direct channel to her soul. Simone performed a gut-renovation on Leonard Cohen’s classic song. She structured the music as a series of prickly, ascending piano figures, lending each line the urgency of a question that can’t be answered.Simone composed this piece as her outraged response to the bloodshed in the south in the 60s. She banged down hard on her piano, as if pummeling injustice with every riff.3. I Loves You PorgySimone’s 1959 cover of the song from the musical Porgy and Bess resulted in her sole top 20 pop hit. Unlike many artists, who buffed the music with a theatrical sheen, Simone brought out something far earthier and erotic in the song. Simone’s take on The Other Woman – one of the most painful songs about infidelity ever penned – inspired Jeff Buckley’s sublime reading. But where his version emphasized rejection, hers puts the accent on the revenge found in the final verse.Riveting takes on this anthem of regret abound, from the Animals’ to Joe Cocker’s wrenching version. In Simone’s version, she sounds remorseful but also cynical about ever receiving full redemption. The sass of this standard could easily have descended into crass Las Vegas camp. But Simone inhabits the song’s joy with a confidence that makes it not just sexy but liberating.Jimmy Webb’s admission of thwarted love requires whoever sings it to convey abject vulnerability. While many Simone performances express unshakable resolve, here she showed an equal understanding of defeat.In one of her most erudite recordings, Simone opens with an elaborate classical piano figure, followed by a vocal that unfurls the full breadth of her range. The final vocal arc may be the most virtuosic of her career.9. I Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be FreeSimone’s take on this civil rights anthem has both a political, and a personal, resonance. Though the lyric suits the singer’s many songs of social awareness, it also speaks to the inner demons she faced in her lifelong battle with manic depression.10. Who Knows Where the Time GoesSimone slowed down Sandy Denny’s existential ode to a near standstill, the better to revel in its depths. Her transcendant reading captures both the limits of mortality and mysteries of the spirit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e5cee4ad79410ae2d6d9fc8672361bab51ed438/298_70_2408_1445/master/2408.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=071e78a8204279de935621207aac1aea","title":"paul mccartney first new solo single release in four years","story":"The 76-year-old will release a double A-side featuring two new singles, I Don’t Know and Come On To MePaul McCartney has announced he will release his first new music in four years in the form of a double A-side single.The songs, I Don’t Know and Come On To Me, mark the legendary singer-songwriter’s first musical output since he was featured alongside Kanye West and Rihanna on FourFiveSeconds in 2015 , and his first solo single since Hope for the Future, which featured as part of the Destiny 2 soundtrack.His last album New was released in 2013 and peaked at number three on the UK and US album charts.The singles, released on 20 June – the first a downtempo ballad, and the second an upbeat rock tune – provide the first preview of McCartney’s new album, due to be released by Capitol Records in the fall of 2018. Last week, McCartney appeared unannounced at Liverpool’s Philharmonic Club, where he played a secret gig consisting of classics from the Beatles and Wings before debuting Come On To Me for the first time.Fans were tipped off about an upcoming McCartney release when then 76-year-old, whose birthday was yesterday, scrubbed his social media accounts clean, replacing his avatar with a drawing of a train track and a tunnel alongside the hashtags #PaulMcCartney and #EgyptStation. In late 2017, McCartney teased his upcoming release in an interview published on his website. “I’ll probably be putting out a new album. So, I’d like that to be something I really love and then hopefully the fans will love it too,” he said. “We’re putting the finishing touches to it now and at the beginning of next year. So, I would like to achieve making that a really great album.”McCartney, who was inducted into the Rock \u0026amp Roll Hall of Fame as both a Beatle and a solo artist, was recently seen marching with gun control advocates in New York City at the March for Our Lives, where he wore a T-shirt that read “We Can End Gun Violence” and recalled bandmate John Lennon’s death. “One of my best friends was killed in gun violence, right around here, so it’s important to me,” he told CNN.McCartney was also recently seen in Liverpool filming a segment of “Carpool Karaoke” with Late Late Show host James Corden, with whom he dueted at last week’s surprise set in Liverpool.

However, the eventual government amendment did not go as far as one drafted by Dominic Grieve, the Tory former attorney general.When the bill returned to the Lords on Monday, peers passed another amendment, based on Grieve’s proposals and tabled by Lord Hailsham, by 119 votes, a bigger majority than the first time the issue was in the upper house.Asked if May was confident about getting her version through the Commons, her spokesman said the Lords had agreed with the Commons on the majority of issues with the bill voted about on Monday, such as customs union membership and environmental protections. He said on Tuesday: “But we cannot accept the amendment on meaningful vote agreed in the Lords. Agreeing to amendable motions would allow parliament to direct government on its approach to exiting the EU, binding the prime minister’s hands and making it harder to secure a good deal for the UK.“It also does not meet the reasonable tests set out last week by the prime minister and the secretary of state for exiting the European Union that any new amendment must respect the referendum result, cannot undermine the negotiations or change the constitutional role of parliament and government.“Our original amendment struck the right balance between respecting the tests set out by the government as well as delivering on the aims of Dominic Grieve’s own amendment. That’s why we will be re-tabling our original amendment today and will look to overturn the Lords decision tomorrow.”Re-tabling the government’s amendment, which has been roundly rejected by Grieve and other Tory rebels, sets up a vote on the issue on Wednesday, when the ping-pong process return the bill to the Commons.Earlier on Tuesday, Grieve had said he and the other rebels were not trying to bring down the government, but said a meaningful vote before leaving the EU may help to avoid a crisis moment.Grieve was criticised in some newspapers over the weekend when he suggested he could “collapse the government” and said he woke up in a cold sweat thinking about it.Grieve said the new amendment was “a mechanism by which the House of Commons could express a view, without moving to a motion of no confidence, which could collapse the government.“All of us must hope this doesn’t happen. But there is a risk it will happen, and if we have no deal at the very end it is a serious crisis.”Several MPs have suggested Grieve’s amendment is unnecessary. The Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat said MPs would be “looking for a new government” if the current one failed to deliver a Brexit deal that could pass the Commons.Grieve said he did not want to leave such a situation to chance. “If we get to a situation where we are three weeks away from no deal … the idea that it’s a good moment to get a new prime minister, have a general election … it doesn’t seem to me a good moment, if it can be avoided,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4926721874b6ca5430473a8c4d66861e3322ac8/0_189_4688_2813/master/4688.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=350446116162d9eda2523dc677757ff7","title":"could coffee replace insulin injections for diabetics","story":"Scientists have developed an implant which releases diabetes medication when it senses caffeine in the bloodThe days of the insulin pen may be numbered. According to researchers in Switzerland, the future of diabetes treatment will not be a shot in the arm after a meal, but a shot of espresso instead.The scientists hope to transform the lives of diabetics who need regular jabs with an implant that contains hundreds of thousands of designer cells which churn out medicine when they sense caffeine in the bloodstream.Tests on diabetic mice showed that such an implant inserted under the skin could be triggered by the caffeine in coffee, tea or energy drinks to produce a drug that controlled the animals’ blood sugar levels. To raise the dose, the scientists simply administered stronger coffee.“You could completely integrate this into your lifestyle,” said Martin Fussenegger, who led the team at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. “You have a tea or coffee in the morning, another after lunch, and another at dinner, depending on how much drug you need to get your glucose back down.”The implant will not be ready for humans any time soon. Fussenegger believes it could be a decade before the necessary tests and trials are done to demonstrate that the approach is safe and effective. But if it does work, it could replace the regular injections that many diabetics require. “You could have your normal life back. The implant could last for six months to a year before it would need to be replaced,” said Fussenegger.Writing in the journal Nature Communications, the Swiss researchers describe how they modified human cells to make a diabetes drug called GLP-1. The drug stimulates so-called beta cells in the pancreas to produce insulin which in turn controls blood sugar levels.The designer cells contain a “gene circuit” that enables them to sense caffeine molecules as they sweep by in the bloodstream. When the cells detect caffeine, they react by manufacturing GLP-1. The implant is made up of thousands of gel-like capsules that each contain hundreds of the designer cells. “When you inject them under the skin, they stick together like caviar,” said Fussenegger. The gel capsules shield the cells from the immune system, but allow caffeine in and GLP-1 out.To see how well the cells worked, the scientists exposed them to drinks with varying levels of caffeine, from chocolate milkshakes and herbal tea to cola, black tea, Red Bull, Starbucks coffee, and a range of instant coffee pods. Herbal tea and chocolate milkshakes had no effect on the cells, but all the other drinks triggered them to make GLP-1 in varying amounts depending on their caffeine content. More than 400 people worldwide are affected by type-2 diabetes and controlling blood sugar levels is a crucial part of managing the condition. A treatment that calls for shots of caffeine will not work for everyone, but Fussenegger is optimistic. “It could be quite an improvement in everyday life for these people. I don’t know many who drink neither tea nor coffee,” he said.

At the end of the match I was certainly tired, but it wasn’t like I was completely off my feet.”“I won’t rule anything out. I won’t rule out playing Eastbourne and not playing Wimbledon. I wouldn’t rule out not playing a tournament next week and trying to get matches like in an exhibition tournament, as well, to get ready for Wimbledon.”Whatever he decides, not a soul in tennis – including the man himself – expected him to force Kyrgios to rise from his torpor in the first set and go to the the limit of his talent only three days after coming within a few points of beating the world No\u0026nbsp1 Roger Federer in the semi-finals on the grass of Stuttgart.It was an extraordinary performance by Murray, another odd one by Kyrgios – and not just because the Scot was coming back a month after his 31st birthday. On form and fitness, this should have been a stroll for the 23-year-old Australian, ranked 21 in the world, against an opponent who only five months ago was lying on an operating table in Melbourne hoping his long-time confident, Dr John O’Donnell, had successfully scraped clean the detritus gathered around the ball joint of his left hip.He had – but the anxiety lingered until precisely 4pm on Tuesday, when, in the first round of the Fever-Tree Championships, he returned to the day job. Playing in comforting sunshine on the Centre Court in front of nearly 10,000 enraptured fans – as well as probable millions on TV – the most stubborn Scot since Rob Roy ignored all internal and external pressure before Kyrgios hung on to win 2-6, 7-6 (4), 7-5 in two hours and 39 minutes.Beforehand, Murray said: “I have zero expectations.” Afterwards, happy to have defied predictions of a wipeout, he gave his conqueror and friend a hug at the net, relieved and happy to have come through his first public examination since Sam Querrey put him out of the quarter-finals at Wimbledon last summer.There was much for Murray to be satisfied about. His court management and instincts were excellent. Until tiredness kicked in, the ball left his racket with a pleasing thump and his movement was more spritely than anyone had suspected. If there was a hint of the limp, it was one only a surgeon could detect.He took a while to trust his body in measured rather than frantic runs for wide balls. But he grew in confidence against an instinctive shot-maker who is always keen to keep the points short. It took Murray five minutes to thrash the first of 16 aces, and 35 minutes before he allowed himself a “Come on!” and a fist pump, to celebrate a break for 4-2. Kyrgios’s will wilted. Murray’s rose – lifted again when a double-fault gifted him the first set in 41 minutes.The second set was tight all the way to the tie-break, where Kyrgios’s huge serve got him over the line. Yet, after 11 months away, Murray resisted the ennui that was slowly enveloping him.Kyrgios said later: “It was a very awkward match for me because I was thinking the guy hadn’t played a match in a year, and I was getting smoked in the first set. I was, like, this is not going to be a good look if I lose.“It wasn’t anywhere near his highest level, but I wasn’t expecting anything less. I knew he was going to compete. His serve, rhythm and all that will take time to come back. I thought he played OK. Maybe he got a bit nervous at times. He would have never doubled on match point when I played him years ago. But that was his first match back. He returns unbelievable. His backhand is money. Everything is the same, really. He’s just got to get matches under his belt.”Even as Kyrgios began to control nearly every exchange in the closing moments – on his own serve and Murray’s – Murray (who is languishing outside the top 150 for the first time since August, 2005) stayed in the fight.He saved two match points in the 10th game, peppering Kyrgios’s forehand into submission. Kyrgios took his aces tally to 18 with some crazy serving, saved a break point and held for 6-5. A forehand inched long to give Kyrgios a third match point – and this time Murray brought the most compelling drama to a conclusion with a double-fault, a weirdly anti-climactic denouement. As Kyrgios said, it is great to have him back."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b358e75bf36056a80bbd6cde6482a34cc724f24a/22_383_4217_2530/master/4217.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd0ad4f1cdef6f9d2108fdd3ac88f609","title":"frankie dettori treble royal ascot","story":"For the second year running, Frankie Dettori was the big news on the opening day of the Royal meeting. The difference this time around was that he could pose for the photographers as well. Twelve months ago Dettori was ruled out for the week a few hours before the first race, but on Tuesday he seized centre stage at his favourite course as only he can.Calyx and Without Parole, Dettori’s partners for the Coventry Stakes and the St\u0026nbspJames’s Palace Stakes, were short on experience and stepping into Group-race company for the first time. Both rose to the occasion impressively for their rider and his day was complete when Monarchs Glen took the concluding Wolferton Stakes to conclude an 87-1 treble, from the jockey’s only three rides.Dettori has now passed Willie Carson to take third place on the all-time list at the Royal meeting with 59 winners stretching back to Markofdistinction’s win in the Queen Anne Stakes in 1990. He is also now a strong favourite to finish the meeting as its leading jockey for the first time since 2004.“Packing a suitcase to go to Sardinia,” Dettori said, when asked what he had been doing on the same afternoon a year ago. Like any long‑term riding career, Dettori’s has had its disappointments and setbacks, some of which – a six-month ban for failing a drugs test in 2012 being the most obvious – were self-inflicted. But he is approaching his 47th birthday in December promising to ride for another five years and showing every sign that he will stick to it.With horses such as these to ride, why not? Calyx is the new favourite for next year’s 2,000 Guineas having seen off his field with a burst of speed a quarter of mile out that carried him clear and left rivals including Sergei Prokofiev, an early candidate for the best juvenile colt in Aidan O’Brien’s stable, racing for the minor honours.Without Parole, meanwhile, has progressed from a maiden at Newcastle last December to become a Group\u0026nbspOne winner. Dettori said that he would have preferred to wait a little longer but felt his hand was forced as U\u0026nbspS\u0026nbspNavy Flag, last year’s Dewhurst Stakes winner, turned for home with a three-length lead. He still got to the leader with something to spare, though he picked up a seven-day ban, which will rule him out of the Eclipse Stakes, and a £4,300 fine from the stewards for using his whip above the permitted level from the two-pole.“I had to move because Ryan Moore in front is always very dangerous,” Dettori said. “Then when I got to him, I looked up and thought, I’ve still got a furlong to go, I’m a sitting duck here. In fairness, Without Parole answered every call. He’s a lovely horse with a big future and that race made a man\u0026nbspof\u0026nbsphim.”All three of the winners on Tuesday were for John Gosden, the trainer who has given Dettori’s career a fresh lease of life in recent seasons.It seems that the jockey’s contract with Qatar’s Al Shaqab Racing operation will not be renewed when it expires next month, having already been reduced significantly in value this season. “Some of the trainers said: ‘Look, if you’ve got better rides, just kick on,’” Dettori said, while Peter Burrell, his business agent, said only that the rider is still available to ride for Al Shaqab “if\u0026nbsprequired”.Since he will be riding against the Al\u0026nbspShaqab colours here this week, it seems that Dettori will not be required beyond next month but Gosden’s burgeoning Newmarket stable seems sure to fill any gap.Aidan O’Brien left without a winner on Tuesday and in addition to Godolphin – who scored with Blue Point in the King’s Stand Stakes – he now faces serious opposition from Gosden, too.Without Parole is the latest young star to emerge from the yard and his form here suggested that he would have gone close in the 2,000 Guineas had he not been forced to miss the race with a foot problem.John Gunther, who bred and owns Without Parole, also bred Justify, the recent winner of America’s Triple Crown, but he insisted this was the best moment of his long racing life and this progressive horse is likely to continue improving for some months yet.After Dettori delivered Monarchs Glen with a well-timed challenge in the concluding race, attention turned to Wednesday’s card, when Dettori will ride Cracksman, the shortest-priced favourite of the week, in the Prince of Wales’s Stakes. If he can deliver on Cracksman too, Dettori will have made this year’s Royal meeting his own with three days to spare."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b77a587ff7936064a9b4f40a01cdc47176bcdd48/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?w=660\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf4c0bf260b8efaf2b247ada2ad0ff92 660w","title":"england v australia third one day international live","story":"England annihilated their own world record ODI score thanks to centuries from Jonny Bairstow and Alex Hales Australia had a bash at chasing it, but fine bowling from Liam Plunkett, Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali finished things in 37 oversSo there we go. Thanks for your company and comments 481, oh my days. Enjoy the rest of your evening. What a day! A phenomenal, ridiculous, ludicrous, filthy, sick, ill and frankly pornographic performance with the bat by England, followed by a very tidy bowling effort. After putting England in, Australia competed for a bit, but their batsmen continually got out when set, and the end, in the end, came pretty quickly. Australia have two more matches in which to avoid a whitewash - good luck with that, lads - while England players have places for India and the World Cup for which to compete.242 runs is both England’s biggest-ever winning margin, and Australia’s biggest-ever losing margin. A fearful symmetry. Rashid tries a googly, Stanlake chucks his gran’s kitchen sink at it, hauls himself out of his crease, and Buttler resolves the situation. “Plunkett is too injury prone to play any of the longer form of the game,” emails Andy Wilson. “Sad really. We should probably look for another 80mph trundler who can only take wickets in English conditions. Tried and trusted, my friend.”Ali tosses up a tempter, Richardson bounces down the track to murder it out of the ground, misses, and barely glances behind as Buttler removes the bails. 35th over: Australia 232-8 (Richardson 11, Tye 2) Target 482 The schdeulers appear to have missed a trick here it’s Scotland who should’ve got the five-match series, with Australia granted a charitable one-offer. It’s the way I tell ’em. Boom boom. Rashid spits one out the front of the hand, hits the seam, and when it keeps low, Agar, who’s made room, bumps it back down the track. It’s not a gimme, mind, and Rashid falls to his right, just about hanging on. 34th over: Australia 227-7 (Agar 24, Richardson 9) Target 482 Agar picks a slower one from the returning Plunkett and pulls it hard through midwicket for four Ponting explains that though he looks a bit awkward, he times the ball nicely and holds the bat a long way down the handle like Adam Gilchrist, which allows him to generate a lot of power. He and Richardson both then add a single, before he steps to leg, makes room, and absolutely shmices six over long on. That made an absolutely delicious knuck. 33rd over: Australia 215-7 (Agar 13, Richardson 8) Target 482 This is pretty slow now, three singles from the first three balls of the over, so let’s have a discussion: how many of this ODI side should be in England’s Test side? Are we really saying Eoin Morgan isn’t a likelier middle-order bet than various of the others who’ve had a shy at it lately? Is Plunkett not likelier to succeed overseas than the various medium-pacers who’ve been picked? Why are Westley and ilk better than Roy? 32nd over: Australia 211-7 (Agar 11, Richardson 6) Target 482 Wood keeps at it, as Ricky Ponting has a bash at explaining why Nathan Lyon is sitting at the side. He suggests that Head and Maxwell bowl a bit of spin, but class is class, especially when you don’t have that much of it. Two from the over. 31st over: Australia 208-7 (Agar 10, Richardson 4) Target 482 Agar drives into the off side for two, then slog-sweeps just wide of midwicket. Two more singles follow, and this is pretty sedate stuff. The required rate is a piffling 14.67.30th over: Australia 200-7 (Agar 3, Richardson 3) Target 482 Wood returns - to try and get this did, I shouldn’t wonder – but has to make do with economy. “So just a thought,” emails Matthew Share. “England’s top 5 batsmen made more today (in less than 5 hours) than the entire team achieved in both innings, put together, in three of the five Ashes tests played recently ... Christ.”I wonder about this sometimes. Imagine how many the one-day lot could thrash with a shiny new red ball and Test match fields. 29th over: Australia 197-7 (Agar 1, Richardson 2) Target 482 Australia haven’t made as thumby a fist of this as the score might suggest. The problem is that they’ve given wickets away when set, and England have better bowlers than they do the spinners and Plunkett have been especially good. Raashid prances in, and the batsmen take a single each what a fine bowler he’s become, and I really do wonder if he might’ve made it in Tests given a proper run. Are we seriously saying that Moeen and Bess are better than him? 28th over: Australia 195-7 (Agar 0, Richardson 1) Target 482 Richardson drives for one to get off the mark. What a grab this is! Maxwell slogs straight down the ground and it looks six all the way, but right on the fence, Plunkett runs around, floats into the air, and grabs with both hands. Belter. 28th over: Australia 194-6 (Maxwell 19, Agar 0) Target 482 Lovely start to the over, Maxwell opening the face to caress four past the keeper. Rashid drags one down so Paine pulls it to square leg ... where he picks out the only man in the deep. Hales takes a few steps to his right and pouches a straightforward effort. Classic spinner’s dismissal. 27th over: Australia 190-5 (Maxwell 15, Paine 5) Target 482 Rashid is enjoying himself here, while Nasser debates where Ben Stokes will go when he returns. Amazingly, it’s Hales under pressure - or not even under pressure, given there’s nothing he can do, beyond become a strike bowler, to preserve his position. 26th over: Australia 188-5 (Maxwell 14, Paine 4) Target 482 “Maxwell looks like he’s about to do something silly,” says Nasser. “But Australia need something silly.” And after two singles comes a scoop for six, then two more singles, and yon require rate is now 12.25. 25th over: Australia 178-5 (Maxwell 6, Paine 2) Target 482 Maxwell is chucking everything at everything, but Rashid’s over yields four singles and a leg bye. This is very nice bowling. Judging by the look on his coupon, Justin Langer will have some “banter” for Maxwell when he sees him next. Stoinis turned the ball to deep square, Maxwell called him back for a ridiculous single, Bairstow smashed in the throw and there we go. Fancy getting run out on this track. 24th over: Australia 173-4 (Stoinis 44, Maxwell 4) Target 482 My days, we’re nearly halfway and Australia need more than 300 runs to win. Stone the crows. Willey returns, and after an expensive opening spell, limits the batsmen to singles. “So what’s the previous highest ever winning margin (in runs) in an ODI?” asks Jason Kilby. “Not that I want to see the Aussie suffer or anything.”New Zealand beat Ireland by 290 in 2008.23rd over: Australia 169-4 (Stoinis 42, Maxwell 3) Target 482 Rashid rushes in and concedes just one from the first four balls, Roy ing brilliantly to save a boundary. But then Stoinis intimidates four through cover, making it five from the over, nearly seven fewer than needed. 22nd over: Australia 164-4 (Stoinis 38, Maxwell 2) Target 482 Stoinis drags a single to leg, then Maxwell does likewise. But it’s not enough, so Stoinis hoiks Plunkett from outside off, pulling uppishly and adding four, then next ball he leathers four over the top, doesn’t bother running, and when the ball plugs nearly looks silly, but it dribbles over the fence and it’s on! The required rate is now 11.45.“Perhaps they have Wood in the team because he’s good for having a laugh?” suggests John Starbuck. 21st over: Australia 154-4 (Stoinis 29, Maxwell 1) Target 482 I’m still backing England to nick this. 21st over: Australia 152-3 (Stoinis 28, Finch 20) Target 482 Stoinis takes a two and one, then Finch waits for him and biceps one down the ground for six. 20th over: Australia 143-3 (Stoinis 25, Finch 14) Target 482 Finch has had enough, accepting two leg byes before lifting Plunkett over square leg with osmium wrists for six. Four more byes follow, a miserable sling down leg side, and suddenly Australia are back in the hunt. “‘I think England might win this,’” emails Damien Clarke, quoting me back to myself. “Please amend this to a definite. I need sleep, and if you say it will be so, I can go to bed.”I reckon you’re good, but don’t blame me when Maxi knocks off the runs in three overs.19th over: Australia 130-3 ( Stoinis 24, Finch 8) Target 482 Rashid is on for Moeen and rustles through a quick over conceding just three. And his last ball tempts Finch forward without an apparent plan, a leading edge dropping just short of the bowler’s e. Er, this is running away from Australia now. “Dont judge Wood by his average,” advises Paul Johnston, “judge him by his economy. He’s never had a year where his economy has averaged more than 6 an over. He’s even got 13 dots in this game. He doesn’t take many wickets but he’s hard to get away. Thats his main contribution to this team.”I’ve no problem with Wood in this format, but I was hoping he’d offer something more in Tests then he does. 18th over: Australia 127-3 ( Stoinis 22, Finch 7) Target 482 Plunkett continues as Rashid gets loose, a sentence which puts me in mind of the below, one the great forgotten hip-hop tracks - any more for any more? Five from the over, and Australia just can’t afford one bowler sending down a decent spell. 17th over: Australia 122-3 ( Stoinis 19, Finch 5) Target 482 Stoinis gets going by getting down on one knee and marmalising six into the crowd at wide long on the catch is taken very smartly indeed. Five singles follow, and Australia needed that. Drinks. 16th over: Australia 111-3 ( Stoinis 10, Finch 3) Target 482 Little-known fact: Stoinis was once called Stonis, until he visited Stamford Hill I think that defines “ niche”. Anyway. Another useful over from Plunkett, five from it. “I think the biggest thing from this series is that England’s spinner is back in form,” emails AB Parker. “Considering how underwhelming the other options that have been tried are, him getting back into form can only be a good thing.”Definitely - like Buttler said, and I think Moeen also said, getting dropped when it’s been in the post for ages can be relieving. I think we need to see more of Leach and Bess, but in this format he’s indispensable. 15th over: Australia 106-3 ( Stoinis 7, Finch 1) Target 482 Finch gets off the mark second ball, then Stoinis gets down for a reverse sweep well in advance and tickles four fine. Marsh decides he’s got no option but to attack Moeen, so looks to hammer him back over his head - and does - but the bat spins slightly in his hand, he doesn’t get all of it, and Plunkett snaffles and snaffle, right on the fence. I think England might win this. 14th over: Australia 100-2 (Marsh 24, Stoinis 2) Target 482 Plunkett replaces Wood, who’s now bowled half of his allocation, and I can’t imagine Stoinis fancies getting acclimatised while he’s banging them in. Hard lines old mate - as Harry Kane might say, “It is what it is”, something it has in common with every single other thing on this planet, apart from Transformers. An excellent opening over, this - Australia manage a leg bye and two singles from it. 13th over: Australia 97-2 (Marsh 23, Stoinis 1) Target 482 Stoinis gets off the mark right away, playing down into the ground and towards cover, then Marsh adds a further single. The required rare is now 10.40. Head, given away. Dear oh dear. Moeen tries a full one and Head plays a nothing shot, prodding a simple return catch. It’s not enough to get set to chase this, you need to get stuck in. 12th over: Australia 94-1 (Head 51, Marsh 21) Target 482 It’s gone a little quiet in the middle, Wood testing Head with boomp-ah he doesn’t do a great job of evading it either, but just about manages it. But after conceding just one from his first three balls, a wide and two twos keep Australia in the hunt, and the second of them, cracked into the covers, raises Head’s fifty. This is really good stuff from the tourists, who might have just chucked bat at everything but instead are making a serious attempt to get the runs. 11th over: Australia 87-1 (Head 47, Marsh 21) Target 482 On comes Moeen, who hustles through precisely the kind of over England were after, ceding just four singles. Is he now a one-day specialist? I know this is a hasty thing to say, but it seems like he’ll need at least two spinners to fail before he gets another shy. “Move on from him for Tests?” says Jamie of Mark Wood. “I don’t disagree, but he’s even worse at ODIs. His record is awful, he’s expensive, and he doesn’t take wickets. They’ve shown huge faith in him for no good reason, and now he’s not even particularly quick.”I think they’ve had good reason to persevere - he’s showed signs - but it’s hard to see how it happens for him now, and the gradual improvement England will have hoped for doesn’t seem to be happening. 10th over: Australia 83-1 (Head 44, Marsh 18) Target 482 After a single to each batsman, both from decent balls - Head defends and Marsh inside-edges - Head carts him from outside off through midwicket. At what point do England start to wonder? Amazingly, they could kind of use a wicket here - England were 79-0 at this stage. 9th over: Australia 75-1 (Head 38, Marsh 16) Target 482 Have a look! Marsh twinkles down, making room, and powers six over Root’s head. Australia have no choice but to set about him, except he repsonds well and concedes just four singles. Still, that’s above the required rate of 9.98. 8th over: Australia 65-1 (Head 36, Marsh 8) Target 482 Willey offers width and Head slashes to where third man once was for four. Two wides are then generously offered, bookending a single, another single arrives when Marsh bashes to cover, and then Head opens the face for four more. Australia are doing alright, you know. “I ducked the day at Antigua when Viv scored the fastest ever Test ton,” tweets @east_indies, “and twenty years later left the WACA at lunchtime to do Xmas shopping only to miss Gilly almost matching Viv...”7th over: Australia 52-1 (Head 27, Marsh 6) Target 482 On comes Joe Root, and Marsh milks a single - can you milk a bowler’s first delivery? - before Head gets down on one knee to launch a drive over extra cover. He doesn’t get all of it, but gets enough to add four, and four singles follow. The rate sneaks up to 10.00 Australia are clearly employing the wickets in-hand method, so they can win via slog at the death.

In another, he raises his fist and flips over his cap to reveal the hand-scrawled message: “Communism will win.” The images, posted later in 2017, drew vitriol and even death threats. Now the second lieutenant who became known as the “commie cadet” is out of the army with an other-than-honorable discharge. Top brass at Fort Drum’s 10th Mountain Division accepted Rapone’s resignation on Monday after an earlier reprimand for “conduct unbecoming of an officer”. Rapone said an investigation found he went online to advocate for a socialist revolution and disparage high-ranking officers and US officials. The army said in a statement only that it conducted a full investigation and “appropriate action was taken”. An unrepentant Rapone summed up the fallout in a tweet on Monday that showed him extending a middle finger at a sign at the entrance to Fort Drum, accompanied by the words: “One final salute.” “I consider myself a revolutionary socialist,” the 26-year-old said. “I would encourage all soldiers who have a conscience to lay down their arms and join me and so many others who are willing to stop serving the agents of imperialism and join us in a revolutionary movement.” Rapone said his journey to communism grew out of his experiences as an army ranger in Afghanistan before he was accepted into the US Military Academy. And those views only hardened during his studies of history as one of the academy’s “Long Gray Line”. He explained that he took the offending selfies at his May 2016 West Point graduation ceremony and kept them to himself until last September, when he tweeted them in solidarity with the NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who was taking heat for kneeling for the national anthem to raise awareness of racism. Many other military personnel also tweeted in favor of Kaepernick, although most were supporting free speech, not communism. West Point released a statement after Rapone posted the photos, saying his actions “in no way reflect the values of the US Military Academy or the US Army”. And the US senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, called on the secretary of the army to remove Rapone from the officer ranks. “While in uniform, Spenser Rapone advocated for communism and political violence and expressed support and sympathy for enemies of the United States,” Rubio said on Monday, adding: “I’m glad to see that they have given him an ‘other-than-honorable’ discharge.” One of six children growing up in New Castle, Pennsylvania, Rapone said he applied to West Point, which is tuition-free, because he couldn’t afford college. He was nominated out of high school by the then US representative Jason Altmire in 2010. “He was an honors student, an athlete, a model citizen who volunteered in the community,” recalled Altmire, a Democrat. “During the interview, he expressed patriotism and looked just like a top-notch candidate. There were no red flags of any kind.” Rapone was not accepted to West Point, so he enlisted. He was deployed to Afghanistan in 2011 and was assigned as an assistant machine gunner in Khost province. “We were bullies in one of the poorest countries on Earth,” Rapone said. “We have one of the most technologically advanced militaries of all time and all we were doing is brutalizing and invading and terrorizing a population that had nothing to do with what the United States claimed was a threat.” Towards the end of his deployment, he learned that West Point fulfils a certain quota of enlisted soldiers every year. Despite his growing disillusionment about the military, he applied and got in. “I was still idealistic,” he said.” I figured maybe I could change things from inside.” In addition to classic socialist theorists such as Karl Marx, Rapone says he found inspiration in the writings of Stan Goff, a retired special forces master sergeant who became a socialist anti-war activist. While he was a cadet, Rapone’s online postings alarmed a West Point history professor, who wrote Rapone up, saying his online postings were “red flags that cannot be ignored”. Rapone was disciplined but still allowed to graduate. Greg Rinckey, an attorney specializing in military law, said it was rare for an officer out of West Point to receive an other-than-honorable discharge. He added that it was also possible the military academy could seek repayment of the cost of Rapone’s education because he did not serve the full five-year service obligation required upon graduation. “I knew there could be repercussions,” said Rapone, who is scheduled to speak at a socialism conference in Chicago next month. “Of course my military career is dead in the water. On the other hand, many people reached out and showed me support. There are a lot of veterans both active duty and not that feel like I do.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/24a2561f5c37964dd323606a33b250bb62be9a69/0_498_4424_2655/master/4424.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6458f37b48a6b9aeb1696dacfcb9e324","title":"italy coalition rift roma register matteo salvini","story":"Matteo Salvini shrugs off critics who say policy reminiscent of fascist pastMatteo Salvini vowed to turn “words into action” in his drive to root out and expel thousands of nomadic Roma from Italy as he shrugged off critics who said the far-right interior minister was adopting illegal policies reminiscent of the country’s fascist past.Salvini, who has seen a jump in his approval ratings in the little under three weeks he has been in office, has called for a new census of Roma and for all non-Italian Roma to be expelled as part of his . He also praised on Twitter the demolition of an “illegal” house used by Roma in Turin - which had been ordered by a local council controlled by Salvini’s League party - even as he was condemned by rival politicians and a top Jewish leader.Salvini’s move against the Roma comes amid a hard line against migrants into Europe, which last week saw him to refuse to allow a ship carrying more than 600 people rescued from Mediterranean from docking in Italy, forcing it to ert to Spain.The developments in Italy have caused the first major rift between Salvini and his Five Star Movement coalition partner. Luigi Di Maio, the leader of the anti-establishment M5S, called Salvini’s order for the creation of a new Roma registry “unconstitutional”. A similar census pitched by the former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi was blocked by an Italian court.It was also lambasted by Noemi Di Segni, the president of Italy’s union of Jewish communities, who said the proposal recalled the fascist race laws of the late 1920s and 1930s. The former centre-left prime minister Paolo Gentiloni also tweeted his disgust, saying: “Yesterday the refugees, today the Roma, tomorrow guns for all.”At first, Salvini seemed prepared to back down from his new policy but in a tweet on Tuesday afternoon he promised to stand by his call for mass expulsions.“I don’t quit and we’re moving forward,” he said in a tweet. He also pointed to a 2012 proposal by politicians in Milan, which included a call for a census of the Roma community in the city. That register, according to an article in Corriere della Sera, was part of a project to help families and children overcome “discrimination and the denial of dignity” and opposing “irregularity and illegality”. Salvini said such proposals were deemed good when they came from the left, but racist when they were proposed by him. “Italians and their security comes first,” he wrote. The row is the first sign of a potentially serious split between Salvini and Di Maio, who has been overshadowed in the first weeks of government and appears eager to rein in the far-right leader. The two parties – Salvini’s League and Di Maio’s M5S – are both populist, but the League has tended to be much more outspoken about its xenophobic and racist attitudes towards migrants and non-Italians.Salvini’s intense focus on immigration and “foreigners” has collided with M5S’s priorities of economic fairness and labour policy. The Roma community has long been a target of Salvini, whose rise to prominence often involved press appearances at Roma camps, which he has frequently threatened to raze. Few minorities are treated with as much contempt in Italy as the Roma, who face prejudice and stereotypes that are deeply ingrained in the social consciousness. On Monday Salvini ordered the census and the removal of all non-Italian Roma – which he called an “answer to the Roma question” – and said he wanted to know “who, and how many” there were. “Unfortunately we will have to keep the Italian Roma because we can’t expel them,” Salvini said on Telelombardia.Salvini is on record as having praised Benito Mussolini, the Italian fascist leader, and his new policy has sparked comparisons by the centre-left Democratic party to ethnic cleansing rules introduced in the late 1920s that also targeted the Roma.“The interior minister does not seem to know that a census on the basis of ethnicity is not permitted by the law,” Carlo Stasolla, president of the Associazione 21 Luglio, which supports Roma rights, told the Ansa news agency. “We also recall that Italian Roma have been present in our country for at least half a century and sometimes they are ‘more Italian’ than many of our fellow citizens.”Francesco Palermo, a former senator in Italy and human rights expert who has defended the rights of Roma, said it would be legally impossible to pursue the creation of an ethnic-specific census and expulsions as Salvini described, because the issue had already been taken up by Italian courts in the past, where it was rejected.But he said the bigger problem was that the reaction to Salvini was generally positive, and that his popularity was growing despite the extreme nature of his positions.“It is very simple and very scary. Except for intellectuals and certain journalists, most people would say there is nothing wrong with this, and that is the tricky point. Salvini knows this. It is a just a means to get political support,” Palermo said.He added that reactions would be different if Salvini was targeting other groups of people who face discrimination, but that racist views about the Roma are “innate” among many people in Italy.Salvini’s actions were also denounced by Roberto Speranza, a lawmaker for the leftwing Freedom and Equality group, who said he had reported the interior minister for inciting racial hatred. “Enough is enough,” Speranza said.About 4,000 Roma live in state-sanctioned ghettos in Rome, according to a 2013 report by Amnesty International. These out-of-city ghettoes consist of pre-fabricated containers or mobile homes in fenced-off areas, often without adequate sanitation or clean drinking water. Inhabitants are excluded from other social housing despite many having lived in Italy for generations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5de203bf3bb65ded1559e73419481e8b934d4b45/40_0_1013_608/master/1013.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93daba6b3d8439c52b0d563ce0b20a84","title":"saudi backed yemeni forces capture hodeidah airport","story":"Military advance comes after UN envoy fails to broker ceasefire with Houthi rebelsSaudi-backed Yemeni government forces have captured the airport at Hodeidah and have started preparations for the more complex task of capturing the city and its port nine miles (15km) to the north. The port is critical to the supply of aid to the rest of the famine-struck country.Confirmation that the airport on the southern outskirts of the city had been seized after three days of fighting came from both TV pictures and eyewitness accounts. At least 40 Houthi fighters who had held the airport were killed, but most retreated into the city, preparing to fight a potentially intense street-by-street campaign that could endanger tens of thousands of civilians.The military advance came after the UN special envoy for Syria, Martin Griffiths, left the Yemeni capital, Sana’a, after failing to broker a ceasefire that would have seen the port taken under UN control. Griffiths provided a closed-door briefing to the UN security council by satellite link on Monday, but departed Sana’a without speaking to the press.The security council has been ided over whether to demand a ceasefire, and Russia, its current chair, gave a downbeat assessment of the chances for a diplomatic breakthrough after the meeting. Most western states oppose the Iranian-backed Houthi takeover of Yemen, but also assert a military solution to the civil war is not possible.The Saudi and UAE forces that are providing military support to the campaign by the Yemeni government led by Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi to win back control of the port insisted Houthi surrender had to be unconditional, rejecting proposals that the rebels remain in the city, but the port could be placed under UN control. The port is currently functioning.The UAE insists it has elaborate contingency aid plans in place if the battle for the port is either prolonged or leads to damage to its infrastructure, so interrupting the supply of food, water and fuel.But the International Rescue Committee said these assurances were little but “a publicity stunt meant to draw attention away from the undue suffering the attack is causing”.Amanda Catanzano, the aid agency’s policy director said: “The so-called relief plan announced by the Arab coalition in Yemen must be seen for exactly what it is a justification to launch an attack that will have catastrophic consequences. The modalities for the delivery of this plan are vague, and the plan alone will not address the underlying causes of conflict in Hodeidah, nor the level of humanitarian need that will be created by a siege or attack on the port and the city itself.“Nobody following this war for the past three plus years can believe that the Saudi coalition has any intention of prioritising the wellbeing of Yemeni civilians. The Hadi government, backed by this coalition, has been in control in Aden and other areas in southern Yemen for three years, yet, innocent Yemeni civilians living in these areas continue to suffer from a total lack of basic healthcare and critical life-saving services.”According to the International Organisation for Migration, 76,000 people have been displaced across the 13 districts of the Hodeidah governorate since the Saudi-led advance began. The numbers that have left the city itself is put as low as 6,000, but many exit routes have been blocked."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3536326.1529420607!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"why irish universities are in thrall to neoliberalism","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe market model of higher education was criticised by President Michael D Higgins recently. Photo: iStockIn a remarkable speech delivered recently, as he joined academics and historians at the launch of the Cambridge History of Ireland, President Michael D. Higgins spoke out against the market model of higher education.Taking unflinching aim at research ratings and rankings, the President criticised metrics as an “ideological fad” of the university.The reliance on any quantitative measure in the presentation of academic work, he said, is not a meaningful contribution to knowledge or understanding.Rather, it is “a conforming bending of the knee to an insufficiently contested neo-utilitarian mediocrity”.The President’s words carry their typical rhetorical force and in the context of higher education in Ireland they resound as both significant and timely.Most importantly, the President’s words question the power of the inidual within the institution, and so inspire the central questions of this piece: if research metrics are an “ideological fad”, who exactly are the perpetrators of this ideology?How complicit is the lone lecturer or researcher? And what, if anything, is their power to resist?Reflecting a broader international trend in higher education, the Irish university is increasingly in thrall to the behemoth of neoliberalism.Its response to a dramatic fall in public funding has involved a turn to economically-driven practice as the only way to survive.Thus, the Irish university no longer boasts autonomy from social or political agenda. It no longer sanctions contemplation as the underpinning of intellectual life.On the contrary, the Irish university exists at the troubled epicentre of utility and enterprise. It is continually anxious about the “competitiveness” of its departmental faculty and the “satisfaction” of its student cohort.It is evident, moreover, that this market model has arrived to stay. There will be no turning of the educational tide and no reversal from neoliberal to liberal.Rather, what we are witnessing in Ireland is a global and irreversible shift – in the words of Ronald Barnett, from “a university-in-itself” (committed to teaching and scholarship and edification of selves) to “a university-for-itself” (committed to performance and productivity and competition against others).At the extreme end of Barnett’s spectrum, the downsides for universities are well rehearsed.In terms of research, publishable work devolves from considered dialogue to selfish CV-building. Complexity and nuance diminish to simplicity and impact. We become “calculable rather than memorable” in the words of sociologist Stephen Ball. And in terms of teaching, neoliberal students become “customers” buying a “university experience” they “invest” in their degree and in their “work- ready” skill set.In its erosion of the university as ideal, this transactional language is deeply damaging. It obstructs the liberal priorities of free expression and robust exchange. Indeed, it obstructs the very heart of educational relationship in its distinctive capacity for transformation as well as care.We recognise the dominance of this neoliberal model – and yet, taking our lead from President Higgins, we recognise also our potential to resist it. As inidual academics, we must consider the possibilities of our own profession.We must trust in everyday practice as a locus for agency and reform. This is not a rejection of accountability nor a nostalgia for a university that never was. Rather, it is a recognition that the university is a whole organism and not a machine of efficient parts. It is a recognition that the university deserves better.We would say that there are three parts to this “better”.Firstly, academics must push back against the discourse that is given. It is always a challenge to silence the neoliberal buzzwords, to think outside the stifling discourse of “publication profile” or “research agenda”. These loud terminologies silence quieter ideals of contemplation and scholarship – and yet we must resist the temptation to think only within their confines. Seeking our own expressive language, we must consider what it truly means to educate and to live well.Secondly, we must connect scholarship to action. If the agency of academia is a matter of frank and risky speaking, it is a matter, also, of aligning practice with theory and so claiming integrity for our own work.We cannot write about social justice without working for its everyday implementation. We cannot critique neoliberalism and return to neoliberal practice behind our office door.In making these claims, we are of course conscious of the precarious moral ground that we currently occupy. But we would call for all those in positions of privilege, ourselves among them, to acknowledge their autonomy as well as their power. Critique can take the form of published scholarship, but it can also take the form of lived practice and solidarity.Finally, and most importantly, we must care for our insecure colleagues and call out the toxicity of hourly-paid work.The President closed his speech with reference to the early career academic who bears the hardest consequences of the neoliberal model.It is well known that these colleagues suffer from unreasonable working schedules and radically variable pay. They do not enjoy the respect nor the security of their permanent peers.Indeed, early career academics exist in a strange professional in-between, often less privileged than the students they teach. “Theirs is a cause”, the President said, “that requires persistent advocacy within the university”.Calling for careful reflection as well as considered practice, Mr Higgins has proved himself a crucial voice for the contemporary university.His perspective is that of the internal critic and it is all the more valuable for being so. In encouraging inidual academics to work towards community – and in encouraging permanent professors to enact “solidarity and care” – his words are a touchstone for us all.Dr Áine Mahon and Dr Shane Bergin are based at University College Dublin’s school of education"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3536047.1529403342!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ryanair overreacted says cork man removed from ibiza flight","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRyanair has called for a two-drink limit per passenger and no airport alcohol sales before 10am. Niall CarsonPA WireOne of the men removed from a erted Ryanair flight on Saturday for allegedly causing a drunken disturbance on the aircraft has described the airline’s reaction as “a disgrace” and “over the top”.Niall Harrington from Cork said he was one of three men taken off a flight traveling from Dublin to Ibiza on Saturday after it erted to Paris Beauvaisover concerns the crew had about the behaviour of some of a 20-strong group. Mr Harrington told Cork radio station Red FM the three people removed from the flight were part of a 20-person stag party on a flight from Dublin to Ibiza. He said a problem arose when his friend opened small bottle of vodka on the flight. This man was asked by a flight attendant to put it away, which he did, but he took it out later.“There was no disruptive behaviour. It was just good fun.”In a statement Ryanair said a “flight from Dublin to Ibiza (on June 16th) erted to Paris Beauvais after three passengers became disruptive inflight. The aircraft landed normally and the passengers were removed and detained by police upon arrival, before the aircraft continued to Ibiza. We will not tolerate unruly or disruptive behaviour at any time and the safety and comfort of our customers, crew and aircraft is our number one priority. This is now a matter for local police.”Mr Harringtondescribed subsequent reports of drunken misbehaviour by the group on the plane as “fake news”. “It was not like that at all.” Mr Harrington said when he heard the flight had been erted to Beauvais airport he thought it was a joke. He was shocked when French police boarded the flight and took away his friend. Minutes later the police returned for Mr Harrington and another friend who had been sitting with the man who opened the vodka.“Everyone was in total shock. It was pretty intense when the police came on.”He said he heard an air hostess say to the police “get the fat guy with glasses”. This was a reference to one of the other men, not the man who had opened the vodka bottle, who had asked why the others were being taken off the flight, Mr Harrington said.The three men were taken to a room where they were asked for their side of the story. Within an hour they were released and told they could go. The three men then got a taxi to Charles de Gaulle airport at a cost of €140 from where they got a flight to Palma and from there on to Ibiza.They have since been contacted by Ryanair to tell them they are now banned from the airline so they will now have to find a flight on another airline to get home on Tuesday. It is expected the three people removed from the flight will fly to Belfast and then take a coach or train to Cork. Mr Harrington was adamant there was no shouting and no unruly behaviour from the group.“We had a couple of pints at the airport, that was all.” He said the group had travelled from Cork to Dublin at 3am on a coach on which there was no alcohol. “There was no real messing, just people having a laugh among themselves.“Before we knew it the plane had landed and guys were coming up with guns in our faces.“Other people on the flight could not believe what happened. We’ve met some of them here in Ibiza.”He described Ryanair’s reaction as over the top and a disgrace. He said the airline was now trying to justify the fact that they erted the flight.“I asked if it was necessary to do this for one person. But we were guilty by association.”Mr Harrington asked other people on the flight to contact Ryanair to complain about the airline’s reaction. Ryanair responded yesterday by calling for significant changes to prohibit the sale of alcohol at airports, such as a two-drink limit per passenger and no alcohol sales before 10am.The Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) has described the Ryanair’s suggestion of restrictions on the sale of alcohol at airports during he morning as “highly draconian”.“The behaviour of some iniduals on the Ryanair flight in question was clearly unacceptable,” a spokeswoman for the DAA said on Monday. She pointed out that Dublin Airport had “worked in the past with Ryanair and other airlines, the Irish Aviation Authority, the gardaí and airport police on a joint education campaign to stress that such behaviour in totally unacceptable and will not be tolerated at the airport”.The spokeswoman said the airport would continue to work “with its airline customers and all other agencies in relation to this issue and will again remind the licence holders in its bars and restaurants of their responsibilities in this area”.However, she said Ryanair’s suggested response was “a highly draconian one that would affect all passengers because of the behaviour of a very, very small minority of airline travellers”. Ryanair’s chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs, has said the airline might consider not selling alcohol on flights before 10am.Mr Jacobs told RTÉ’s News at One he believed alcohol was involved in the incident, but said it was rare that a flight had to be erted. He said not only were the remaining passengers on board the original flight delayed and inconvenienced, but so too were 180 passengers in Ibiza awaiting a return flight.He called on the DAA to introduce a system where people have to show their boarding pass to buy alcohol (as with duty free purchases), with a limit of two drinks. This would require only a small amount of effort, and he felt that the vast majority of people would be happy with such an arrangement.

Photograph: Dan KitwoodGetty ImagesTwo out of three British voters who backed Brexit would prefer to see a hard border in Ireland than for Britain to remain in the EU customs union, according to a new poll.Only one in three British voters said they could not accept a different status for Northern Ireland after Brexit and six out of 10 Leave voters said that leaving the EU was more important than keeping the United Kingdom together.The poll by Conservative peer Michael Ashcroft found that, given a straight choice between a hard border and remaining in the customs union, 41 per cent of all voters would choose a hard border compared to 32 per cent who would remain in the customs union. Leave voters would choose a hard border by 66 per cent to 10 per cent and Conservative voters would make the same choice by 67 per cent to 14 per cent.Remain voters would stay in the customs union rather than see a hard border by 55 per cent to 21 per cent and Labour voters would make the same choice by 47 per cent to 25 per cent.More than nine out of 10 unionists in Northern Ireland, and three out of four Conservatives in Britain, agreed that the Border issue is being “deliberately exaggerated by politicians and others to suit their own political agenda.”Writing in the Daily , Lord Ashcroft said that most British voters thought Brexit was taking too long, with Leave voters often blaming those who want to soften or delay Britain’s exit from the EU.“Given these views - impatience with the process, determination for the UK to operate an independent trade policy, and the suspicion that Brexit opponents are deliberately throwing up hurdles - it is not hard to imagine how Leave voters would react if told the UK would not be taking back as much control as they hoped because of the Irish border, an issue they believe is being blown out of proportion,” he wrote.Only one in three voters in Britain said it would be completely unacceptable for Northern Ireland to have a different status in the EU from England, Scotland and Wales. Three in 10 said such an outcome “would not be ideal, but would be acceptable as part of a deal to get a sensible Brexit arrangement”. And most British voters said that they did not have a view about whether Northern Ireland should remain in the UK, saying it was for the people there to decide.Lord Ashcroft’s poll found that, asked to choose between keeping the UK together and leaving the EU, 63 per cent of British voters would leave the EU, compared with 27 per cent who would keep the UK together. Among Conservative voters, 73 per cent would choose leaving the EU with just 22 per cent saying they would keep the UK together. Labour voters would choose leaving the EU over keeping the UK together by 50 per cent to 34 per cent.“Those who have pondered Brexit’s consequences for UK union have usually focused on the resentment felt in places where majorities voted to remain in the EU,” Lord Ashcroft wrote.“But there is another risk: that a question like the Irish border, which most Leave voters see as a relatively minor practical issue that could be resolved, should prevent the majority getting the Brexit they think they voted for.”Lord Ashcroft conducted separate polls with 3,294 voters in Britain, 1,666 in Northern Ireland and 1,500 in the Republic, along with focus groups in a number of towns and cities.A majority of voters in Northern Ireland said they thought Brexit had made Irish unification in the foreseeable future more likely, a view shared by just four in 10 in the Republic. Asked how they would vote if there was a border poll tomorrow, 49 per cent of voters in Northern Ireland said they would vote to stay in the UK, while 44 per cent would vote for a united Ireland.In the Republic, 35 per cent of voters said they would like to see a united Ireland in the next few years but 56 per cent said it would not be practical or affordable in the immediate future.Voters in Northern Ireland were more pessimistic about their own future than they were when they looked across the Border at the Republic. 64 per cent said Northern Ireland was on the wrong track, compared to 25 per cent who thought it was on the right track. But 55 per cent of those in Northern Ireland said the Republic was on the right track, compared to 35 per cent who said it was on the wrong track.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

We don\u0027t want to be closed in on ourselves, he said. The report was released ahead of the Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops, which will cover the topic “Young people, the faith and vocational discernment”, and will be held in October this year. The Synod’s primary aim is to make the whole Church aware of her important and not at all optional task of accompanying every young person, without exclusion, towards the joy of love, said the Cardinal. The Instrumentum laboris document, which was published in Italian, also said pre-synodal meetings had welcomed young people from other Christian confessions, from other religions and even from non-believers. It was a sign that the young welcomed with gratitude, because it showed the face of a hospitable and inclusive Church able to recognize the wealth and contribution that can come from each for the good of all, it said. Pope Francis has been widely regarded as having more progressive views on issues such as marriage and sexuality than his predecessors. Last month a sexual abuse victim claimed he was told by Pope Francis that God had made him gay.Juan Carlos Cruz, a victim of Chile’s most notorious abusive priest, Fernando Karadima, said: He told me ‘Juan Carlos, that you are gay does not matter. God made you like that and he loves you like that and I do not care.However, last week the Pope also said that opposite-sex couples were the only ones able to form families. The Catholic Church\u0027s catechism says that homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered and contrary to the natural law. Vatican City and Holy See\u0026#39Oxbridge white blokes\u0026#39 like Monty Python have had their day, says BBC comedy boss\u0026#39Minor explosion\u0026#39 at Southgate underground station sparks mass evacuationTrump blames the Democrats for family separation policyDuke and Duchess of Sussex make Royal Ascot debutHarrow schoolboy \u0026#39provoked fatal punch\u0026#39 court rules as attacker is spared jailInside the Erdogan stronghold that turned out a challenger threatening to topple the Turkish strongmanNHS surgeon hid his HIV from bosses sparking nationwide alertMacron and Merkel put on united front as they move to resolve EU problems, but deep isions remainComment: MPs debate cannabis – while Labour goes to potCannabis users smoke openly as calls mount for drug to be legalisedBristol\u0026#39s mayor removes portrait of Edward Colston from office saying she cannot bear to have him looking at her Isil fanatic who planned to assassinate Theresa May caught after two-year MI5 operation, court hears Comment: Cannabis is already effectively legal in Britain – and it isn\u0026#39t going wellJudge rules fracking is not banned in Scotland, despite ministers saying it wasComment: The cannabis industry wants to make big money, no matter the consequences for society.

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.Mada\u0027in\u0026nbspSaleh\u0026nbspnear Al-Ula\u0026nbsphave survived for 2,000 yearsThis is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Ahmed\u0026nbspis descended from a long line of imamsStanding in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Tombs in Mada\u0027in Saleh were decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century with Greek, Roman and Persian symbolsThe ancient Biblical city of Dedan is situated on the lip of an oasisCliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes such as elephants, mushrooms, and sealsAncient Dedan inscriptions.

Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen.

Holes in the rock floor denote a sacrificial spot from the time of the DedanitesDeploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra. It was built using stones from those cities. They can be seen fortifying the occasional doorway.Ahmed leads the way down an empty street to the house where his parents used to live – collapsed beams, upturned crates. He shows me the mosque, erected over the spot where the Prophet Mohammed stopped in 630AD, and with a goat bone drew in the sand the direction of Medina Ahmed’s uncle was the last imam.Iranians are angry with Israel and Saudi Arabia, not just TrumpSaudi Arabia to build giant $9bn oil complex with French company TotalSaudis \u0027to cut off Qatar\u0027 with canal, nuclear dump and military baseSaudi Arabian Prince toured Hollywood and Harvard on trip to USAnd a modern inscription: the name “Charles”, scratched on the oat-coloured mud wall not, as momentarily I’d hoped, by Charles Doughty, but by Prince Charles (in 2015, with his key), and below it the Islamic translation.During the Islamic period, Al-Ula, or El-Ally as Doughty knew it, became an important station on the haj road south, and marked the last place where Christians were permitted to travel.\u0026nbspIbn Battuta described how pilgrim caravans paused here for four days to resupply and wash, and to leave any excess baggage with the townspeople “who are known for their trustworthiness”.“I hope we are still doing our best to be like that,” Ahmed says. “You can try, if you want, to leave something.”The only thing I left behind after my four days here was an urge to come back.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They then saw a high-speed flare get thrust out, escaping from the rim of the black hole. Scientists have seen black holes killing and swallowing stars. And the jets have been seen before.But a new study shows the first time that they have captured the hot flare that comes out just afterwards. And the flare and then swallowed star have not been linked together before1623 Dog-sized horned dinosaur fossil found shows east-west evolutionary ide in North AmericaA British scientist has uncovered the fossil of a dog-sized horned dinosaur that roamed eastern North America up to 100 million years ago. The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1723 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain.

The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.2023 Earth could be at risk of meteor impactsEarth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occur2223 Researchers discover \u0027lost world\u0027 of arctic dinosaursScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”.

It is the first withdrawal from the bank, which was built in 2008.1423 Scientists find exactly what human corpses smell likeNew research has become the first to isolate the particular scent of human death, describing the various chemicals that are emitted by corpses in an attempt to help find them in the future.1523 Black hole captured eating a star then vomiting it back out Astronomers have captured a black hole eating a star and then sicking a bit of it back up for the first time ever. The scientists tracked a star about as big as our sun as it was pulled from its normal path and into that of a supermassive black hole before being eaten up. They then saw a high-speed flare get thrust out, escaping from the rim of the black hole. Scientists have seen black holes killing and swallowing stars. And the jets have been seen before.But a new study shows the first time that they have captured the hot flare that comes out just afterwards. And the flare and then swallowed star have not been linked together before1623 Dog-sized horned dinosaur fossil found shows east-west evolutionary ide in North AmericaA British scientist has uncovered the fossil of a dog-sized horned dinosaur that roamed eastern North America up to 100 million years ago. The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1723 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits. Some characteristics are more common in women, while some are more common in men, and some are common in both men and women, according to the study1823 Life on Earth appeared hundreds of millions of years earlier than previously thoughtLife may have come to earth 4.1 billion years ago, hundreds of millions of years earlier than we knew. The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.2023 Earth could be at risk of meteor impactsEarth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occur2223 Researchers discover \u0027lost world\u0027 of arctic dinosaursScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”2323 A team of filmmakers in the US have made the first ever scale model of the Solar System in a Nevada desertIllustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.Chlorophyll-a is present in all plants, as well as algae and photosynthetic bacteria, and scientists long assumed that there was a “red limit” on photosynthesis.Astrobiologists have used this supposed limit to gauge whether complex life could be evolving on distant planets in other solar systems.However, some photosynthetic bacteria known as cyanobacteria have another trick up their microscopic sleeves.\u0026nbspResearchers found another form of chlorophyll working in communities of these creatures growing in shaded conditions in “bacterial mats” in Yellowstone National Park and inside rocks found on Australian beaches.In near-infrared light, the chlorophyll-a systems of these bacteria shut down and a different variety – chlorophyll-f – begins operating in lower energy conditions “beyond the red limit”.Junk food-loving bacteria, not extra weight, cause arthritisProfessor Rutherford and his team tested these abilities by placing cyanobacteria communities into cupboards fitted with infrared LEDs.“Finding a type of photosynthesis that works beyond the red limit changes our understanding of the energy requirements of photosynthesis,” said Dr Andrea Fantuzzi, co-author of the study that was published in the journal Science.“This provides insights into light energy use and into mechanisms that protect the systems against damage by light.”Besides broadening the search for aliens, the discovery could help scientists genetically engineer crops that can survive in a wider range of light conditions.Dr Dennis Nurnberg, the first author of the study, said: “I did not expect that my interest in cyanobacteria and their erse lifestyles would snowball into a major change in how we understand photosynthesis.\u0026nbsp“It is amazing what is still out there in nature waiting to be discovered.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It can range from seeing a child wearing the same shirt for a few days, or noticing that they haven’t washed when they get changed for PE. We won’t stand by if we know people are in need,” she said.“It’s not always an impact on families that are on benefits – it can be self-employed families or those made redundant. More and more households are falling on hard times.“It’s becoming part of my year on year budgets. We try to look at the budget very carefully to put that money aside to allocate towards these products. Staff are even buying extra bits to distribute it to families when they go shopping.“I didn’t come into the profession to see children suffer.

We know that the best route out of poverty is through employment, and since 2010 an extra three million people are now in work and 300,000 fewer children are living in absolute poverty.

While thousands were asked to come to UK to help rebuild after the war, the Home Office is showing them nothing but disdain when they are heroes. I want this government to show respect for those who helped the UK off its knees and an amnesty for the Windrush generation, whichever country they are from.”\u0026nbspIn one case, 73-year-old Indian grandmother Raj Rani Bhanote, who has lived in the UK for 55 years, was stranded in the US for four days after being blocked from boarding a plane back to Britain.Ms\u0026nbspBhanote was questioned by British Airways check-in staff as she tried to board a flight from Arizona after visiting relatives. They claimed not to recognise the stamp on her Indian passport, designed to prove her right to remain in the UK.Staff contacted the Home Office, which claimed she was not a British resident, and she was not allowed to board the aircraft. It took four days for the government’s\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbsptaskforce to intervene so she could return home.\u0026nbspMs Bhanote, who has three children and four grandchildren in the UK and worked as a\u0026nbsppost office assistant, told The Independent she felt “terrible”, adding: “I spoke to someone on the phone who refused to speak to my family and could not understand why they were behaving in such a disrespectful manner towards me.”Her son,\u0026nbspArun\u0026nbspBhanote, has since written to his MP to request an investigation by the Home Office into what he described as “racist maladministration and xenophobic calamity”.Satbir\u0026nbspSingh, chief executive of the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), said the case was a “disturbing but sadly all-too-common occurrence”.“Cases like this show just how incredibly complicated, rigid and inhumane our immigration system has become,” he said.\u0026nbsp“It’s a relief that the\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbsptaskforce was able to help in this case, but it also shows the need for such remedies to be available to everybody who faces poor decision-making either at the Home Office or at the border.”It comes as the government announced that a\u0026nbspday celebrating the Windrush generation and their descendants was\u0026nbspto be held annually, after it emerged a large number of\u0026nbspBritish\u0026nbspCaribbean\u0026nbspnationals had been wrongly targeted by immigration officials in the UK.But Alessandra\u0026nbspSciarra, from Lewisham Refugee and Migrant Network, which supports migrants and refugees in south London, said they had seen at least a dozen cases of non-Caribbean Commonwealth citizens encountering\u0026nbspsimilar issues\u0026nbspin the past six months.“They extend to people from different countries it’s much more widespread.\u0026nbspWindrush\u0026nbspis just the tip of the iceberg,” she said.Ms Sciarra\u0026nbspsaid one of their cases involved a 65-year-old Indian man who was born in Uganda and became a British protected person after fleeing persecution to the UK in 1972.\u0026nbspDespite living here since, working and building a family, and never encountering any issues with his immigration status, he has recently been unable to find work due to issues with his documents.“In the 46 years he has been living in the UK, he has integrated successfully into his community in Lewisham. His wife and adult children were all recognised as British citizens,” she\u0026nbspsaid.“But recently Mr Khan lost his job and began looking for employment again just prior to retirement. He faced numerous issues in this process, as many employers asked him for a proof of his right to reside and work in the country.”Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said one of her constituents, of Ghanaian descent who has been in Britain for over 50 years, had recently contacted her after had been threatened with deportation.The Labour MP said: “The Windrush scandal goes way beyond the people that stepped off Empire Windrush or even all those from the Caribbean. Everyone from the Commonwealth who came here before 1973 could get caught up in the scandal, including deportation or detention.“These are not isolated mistakes. They are a product of the government’s ‘hostile environment’ policy, and Theresa May’s instruction to ‘deport first, appeal later’. Until these end, the scandal will not go away.”The Home Office declined to disclose the exact number of non-Caribbean cases​​ the taskforce was dealing with.Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East, said his office received on average three cases a week – or around 150 a year – from Indian nationals who have lived in the UK for more than a decade but are now denied their rights and in some cases threatened with deportation.“It is not just Windrush cases,” he said.\u0026nbsp“There is a systemic failure on the part of the Home Office to deal with cases promptly. Delay is being used as a substitute for decision-making.“There are a lot of people who are from India who have been in this country for 20 years, but are being held in a long queue being made to sign on and\u0026nbspcannot work, but are actually entitled to stay here.“As a result, people can stay for a very long time – as long as 20 years – and still not know precisely where they stand. Some inevitably\u0026nbspget removed without anyone intervening. They live in a subculture of society\u0026nbspand so are reluctant to come forward, but actually they do have the right to stay.”Mr Vaz raised concerns that the Home Office had “erted resources” from dealing with immigration cases from the Indian subcontinent in order to set up the Windrush\u0026nbsptaskforce.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UKThe ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

Most agreements at summits are struck beforehand by backroom officials, and previous pre-cooked Brexit conclusions have been approved within minutes by leaders.It marks an escalation in the language by the national leaders and a warning shot across the PM\u0027s bow after months of deadlock.The European Council expresses its concern that no substantial progress has yet been achieved on agreeing a backstop solution for IrelandNorthern Ireland.Ms May is also attending the Brussels summit – which is on the same day as the England vs Belgium World Cup match – but will be excluded from the section on Brexit. EU member states have since the start of the process said they do not want to negotiate with the PM directly, instead delegating the task to Commission chief negotiator Michel Barnier.The news comes ahead of a House of Commons showdown for the Prime Minister on Wedneday, where she could be defeated on whether the Government must offer a truly meaningful vote to\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbspon the state of talks at the end of the year – potentially opening the to her agreement with the EU being rejected.\u0026nbspMr Barnier warned on Tuesday in a speech in Vienna that the British government needed a dose of “realism” about what could be achieved in a deal between the EU and UK and that certain things would “no longer be possible” outside the bloc. He confirmed that Britain would not get direct access to EU-only criminal and security databases, the\u0026nbspEuropean Arrest Warrant, or be able to manage Europol or Eurojust after it left.Addressing “some in the UK”, he said: “They try to blame us for the consequences of their choice. Once again, we will not be drawn into this blame game. It will mean wasting time, and we don’t have time.”Talks have in part been deadlocked because the Prime Minister has limited room for manoeuvre in Westminster, with no majority for her party and hemmed in by Northern Irish unionists and Tory Eurosceptics on whom she relies to pass votes in the House of Commons.The UK earlier this month published a plan for a backstop solution to prevent a hard border in Northern Ireland, but EU officials immediately picked holes in the plan and said it raised more questions than it answered.A separate British government policy paper which will attempt to propose a long-term customs arrangement between the EU and UK as a whole has reportedly been delayed until July, after the June 28 and 29 summit. Next week\u0027s meeting is the last before the October Council meeting, which the EU says a deal must be agreed by in order to give time for ratification and approval.The draft European Council conclusions seen by The Independent say: “1) In light of the state of play presented by the Union negotiator, the European Council welcomes the further progress made on parts of the legal text of the Withdrawal Agreement.“2) The European Council expresses its concern that no substantial progress has yet been achieved on agreeing a backstop solution for IrelandNorthern Ireland. It recalls the commitments undertaken by the UK in this respect in December 2017 and March 2018, and insists on the need for intensified efforts so that the Withdrawal Agreement, including its provisions on transition, can be concluded as soon as possible in order to come into effect on the date of withdrawal. It recalls that negotiations can only progress as long as all commitments undertaken so far are respected in full.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

South Korea and the Pentagon announced they would halt the annual Freedom  military drill scheduled for August.In an unusual move, Chinese state media announced Kim\u0027s visit and said he would stay for two days. Previously China would only confirm Kim had visited after he had left the country. No other details were provided.A Kim trip to China to discuss his summit with Trump had been widely anticipated in diplomatic circles. China is North Korea\u0027s most important diplomatic and economic backer but has been angered by Pyongyang\u0027s nuclear and missile tests.Police tightened security along Beijing\u0027s main Changan Avenue, which leads to the Great Hall of the People where Chinese leaders normally meet visiting heads of state, and also outside the Diaoyutai State Guest House, where Kim stayed with his wife during his March visit to Beijing.Outside the east gate of the Great Hall, where foreign leaders are officially welcomed, authorities had erected a screen running the full length of the road, cutting off the view behind it.China has welcomed the warming of ties between Washington and Pyongyang, and offered to help.Beijing has been particularly pleased by Trump\u0027s announcement to suspend military drills, which China has long pushed for under its dual suspension proposal, whereby North Korea stops weapons tests and the United States and South Korea stop military drills, so both sides can sit down for talks.South Korea and the United States have agreed to suspend all planning activities regarding the Freedom  military drill scheduled for August, according to a South Korean defence ministry statement.A Pentagon statement confirmed the suspension and added that there would be a meeting between the secretaries of defence and state as well as Trump\u0027s national security adviser on the issue this week.North and South Korea agree to joint teams for Asian GamesUS and South Korea \u0027poised to halt war games within days\u0027Asia\u0027s fine balance of military power is about to change completelyTrump salutes North Korea general in exchange aired on state televisonMike Pompeo says no sanctions relief until North Korea denuclearises Last year, 17,500 American and more than 50,000 South Korean troops participated in the Ulchi Freedom  drills, although the exercise is mostly focused on computerized simulations rather than live field exercises that use weapons, tanks or aircraft.The U.S.-South Korean exercise calendar hits a high point every spring with the Foal Eagle and Max Thunder drills, which both wrapped up last month.The decision to halt military exercises in South Korea has bewildered many current and former U.S. defence officials, who only learned about it when Trump made his remarks after the Singapore meeting.Japan\u0027s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Tuesday there would be no changes to joint drill plans between the United States and Japan, both of which also engage in regular deterrence exercises against North Korea.The United States is in a position to keep its commitment to its allied nations\u0027 defence and our understanding is there is no change to the U.S. commitment to the Japan-U.S. alliance and the structure of American troops stationed in Japan, Suga said in a regular briefing.The Pentagon has yet to publicly release the cost of previous and future joint military exercises with South Korea, a week after Trump cited their tremendously expensive cost as a reason for halting them.Spending data for previous military exercises in Korea and elsewhere, however, suggest that the cost of a single exercise would be in the low or perhaps tens of millions of dollars in a U.S. military budget this year of nearly $700 billion.In response to repeated requests for cost data, Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Logan, said: We are currently evaluating the costs of the exercises.Calculating the cost of military exercises is a complicated process, often requiring data from different branches of the military and spread over several budgets over different years.Troops who would have been involved in the exercises would still require training and certification, which would still cost money, said Abraham Denmark, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for East Asia under President Barack Obama.To me, the idea of this as a cost saving measure doesn\u0027t really make much sense, Denmark said.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We are living longer, getting fatter and needing ever pricier drugs.Given those pressures, the health service badly needs reinvention — a cross-party rethink about what it should now be doing and how to fund it.CITING “human rights” worries to reject an amnesty for our veterans of the Troubles in Northern Ireland is cravenly spineless.What about the rights of old soldiers ­living in fear over action they took in the heat of battle four decades ago?This witch-hunt into them, while IRA killers have a free pass, is appalling.But instead of ending it, and risking a possible scrap with the European Court of Human Rights, Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley has refused.Too many Government ministers timidly surrender to civil service caution.They should just take the right side of the argument and brave any consequences.TORY Christopher Chope is out of his mind.The MP loves to scupper Bills he doesn’t think are thought through.But an “upskirting” law is entirely justified and has near universal support from the Government, politicians and public.A public that now thinks old Tories side with perverts.Great job, sir.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Working mothers are often the most motivated and dynamic workers in the room.And yet working mothers still get seriously bad press.The comments by Kelly Brook this week are a case in point.She said on TV’s Loose Women some working mothers use their children as an “excuse” to skip deadlines or miss work.She also said it’s unprofessional for women to talk about children in the workplace and that “professional” women never do so.Kelly — who doesn’t have any children — made the remarks during a discussion about whether it is a mother’s job to look after her sick children.I honestly wonder what her views are founded on.Since she started modelling when she was still a teenager, it’s hard to imagine she has ever worked any kind of nine-to-five job in an office.And has she ever employed any working mums? I don’t know for sure but I somehow doubt it.I think Kelly’s comments are just founded on prejudice.I also wonder why she didn’t include men in her evaluation of working ­parents.Funnily enough men, in my experience, are way more comfortable than many women about citing ­childcare or a sick child as the reason for their absence or lateness.And most working women I know would go to extraordinary lengths to avoid “blaming” their absence on their children.Either way, Kelly’s suggestion that it’s more professional for women not to mention their children is crazy.But with views like that flying around — from other women — is it any surprise that some women worry that if they mention their children at work they will be discriminated against?I certainly know women who go to work and feel like they have to “present” as being someone without children — for fear of losing out on promotion.But if we all pretend we don’t have kids we will never change people’s opinion.So the more women talk about the fact they are working mothers — and proud — the more perceptions will change.It’s important people realise there IS pressure on a working parent — and particularly on working mums.But that’s very different to assuming the pressure makes them unreliable.No doubt when Kelly Brook has children herself, she will realise all this.And I really hope she does have kids.Unlike Luisa Zissman, who said in retaliation to her comments that Kelly will “never have children” because of her “track record with men”.That’s mean-spirited and unfair.I am sure motherhood will be the making of Kelly, just as it is for so many other women.Having said all of the above though, I will say this: There is a difference between acknowledging that you are a working mother and banging on about your kids and their achievements to anyone who will listen.Don’t get me wrong.I often talk to other working mums whose kids are at the same stage as mine about whatever issues we are particularly grappling with.But no matter how wonderful your kids are, there is nothing more boring to most people than being shown pictures of kids they’ve never met and don’t know.In other words, it’s one thing being proud to be a working mother — but we should all avoid being baby bores.The fact is, breastfeeding is not for everyone. Nor does it necessarily come down to choice – sometimes it just ain’t going to happen, for a variety of reasons.If that’s the case women should be supported, not vilified and pressured.For what it’s worth, I tried breastfeeding – for about five minutes. It didn’t work for me and, having just given birth to another human being, I didn’t feel bad about that one little bit.After all, it’s my body and I’ll do what I like, thanks very much. No one was going to tell me I was letting my kids down by giving them formula and – guess what – they’ve turned out fine. ONE of the highlights of my year was attending a private lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace last Wednesday.I left feeling bowled over by how incredible she is, so engaging and knowledgeable on so many subjects, from working mothers to football.The other thing that struck me is how very human and down to earth she is.When we were comparing notes about our various family members and how quickly they grow up, I realised we were just talking woman to woman.It really was an extraordinary lunch with an extraordinary person. IN the wake of the allegations against Harvey Weinstein it is no surprise that large companies – especially those in the film industry – are absolutely terrified their staff might behave inappropriately.But the news that Netflix has banned flirting is pretty unbelievable.It has issued a series of guidelines for employees about how to behave at work.That includes a ban on film crews looking at anyone for more than five seconds and the suggestion that anyone who feels pestered at work yells: “Stop! Don’t do that again!”Employees are also not allowed to touch or hug people for too long.It’s not that I disagree with those guidelines – try locking eyes with someone for five seconds and you’ll realise it’s creepy.It’s the fact that Netflix feels the need to issue them.I guess the company executives think their employees are in need of guidance.But the rules they have set out look, to any right-minded person, like common sense.After all, most of us know if our attention is unwanted or if someone feels uncomfortable – we stop whatever is causing the issue.And if you need a set of rules like this to tell you how to behave then there is a problem.The fact Netflix has decided it needs to do this is, frankly, a terrible state of affairs.It’s also a bit ironic given how many of the shows it makes and airs are about rape, murder and other violence against women.I guess there’s an element here of Netflix wanting to be seen to be doing the right thing.But to my mind it’s a bit holier than thou – and the company has taken it too far.CAN it really be true that Niall Aslam quit Love Island because he is insecure about his ears?If so, that is so sad. What is wrong with our young people? Actually, I know the answer to that.I can honestly say that I was never worried about body issues and none of my friends were either – it simply wouldn’t have occurred to us to compare ourselves unfavourably to everyone else.I’m pretty sure this kind of insecurity, which is rife among our young people and getting worse, is a direct result of reality TV and social media. IN the same week it was revealed that a young girl wet herself rather than interrupt her gaming, new research has proved that video games are addictive in the same way as drugs and alcohol.So what can we do about this new epidemic?There is usually an age limit for these games – and that is often ignored.But the fact is, you can’t expect the Government to sort this out: It is a parenting issue.Technology has given us many positives over the years – but it’s also caused problems that didn’t exist a decade or two ago.And this is one of them.Parents, listen up.If you want to avoid children getting addicted to games, don’t buy them.Limit the time your children have on technology.Get involved with what they are doing online and don’t just turn a blind eye.The best thing you can do is get kids out of the house – active, busy and involved in sport.Also bear in mind that if you are lazy, they will be lazy.And if you spend all day, every day, looking at your phone, so will they.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Israel, America, the Tories and Brexit the next.Corbyn’s off limits, obviously, as Frankie thinks he’s “a real person”, but there’s a regular cast of soft targets, including Donald Trump, Richard Branson (“a c***”), Boris, Michael Gove, Ruth Davidson (“a bastard”) and usually a joke about Prince Philip dying, which I think we can put down to the host’s very obvious and well-deserved self-loathing.Prince Philip, after all, was mentioned in dispatches fighting real Nazis in World War Two, instead of just ranting about them to a couple of hundred students at the Edinburgh Fringe.At the age of 97, The Duke is also still a thousand times more unpredictable, off-message, edgy and funny than any of the people on NWO and, unlike Frankie, who has 11 scriptwriters, also comes up with his own material.The hatred and abuse of Israel is slightly harder to explain, though. Frankie claims it’s because “They break international law”, but then so do a lot of countries, including Russia, which even shoots down passenger aircraft.A stroke of luck then, you might think, that the BBC’s just screened Frankie’s two-part, pre-World Cup travelogue, Frankie Goes To Russia, where, unfortunately, he didn’t have time to raise the issue of the aircraft, but he did go on Moscow radio to denounce the British Empire (topical or what!).If you were expecting anything else, of course, you give Frankie Boyle more credit than his apparent cowardice and hypocrisy deserves.If you were also expecting laughter, then I applaud your optimism, but you’ll no more get it on NWO than on Have I Got News For You, or The Mash Report, or any of those other shows that have decided the right-on part of the world is untouchable and their own left-wing agenda is far more important than being funny.The BBC’s continuing claims of impartiality, on the other hand? Well, forgive me if I let out the hollowest laugh of my life, but they are really, darkly funny.Ha . . .— GIVEN the BBC’s endless, self-serving and grovelling tributes to the NHS are still very much ongoing, I feel it would be wrong, at this point, if I didn’t join in the birthday celebrations.For though it has its faults and is often criticised, it’s been there for us, healing the lame, curing the sick, becoming the envy of the world, a shining beacon to the entire universe, which makes me fall to my knees and give thanks for seven decades’ service at the mere mention of its sacred initials.Happy 71st, Bupa.All those liars who say they want fat, unattractive people on Love Island. The disturbing Trouble With Women revelation that Anne Robinson keeps a scrapbook of her old newspaper columns, when so many hamsters still go without decent bedding every night.And The X Factor giving a job not just to Robbie Williams, who’s won 18 Brit awards and five Ivor Novello awards, but also his wife, Ayda Field, who handed Emmerdale the NTA’s 2017 Best Soap award. There on merit . . .IF you have ever wondered why some people are so dementedly pleased to see the World Cup arrive, try watching daytime TV just before the ball-kicking tournament starts.I did last Wednesday and quickly fell down a QVC rabbit hole, where I discovered Amanda Holden has a neat line in selling stuff nobody actually needs but everyone seems to want.Suitcases that aren’t really suitcases, string chairs designed to look like a cat’s sphincter, rugs that would make a Moroccan fez salesman blush, machine-woven toilet roll baskets, lamp-shades so taut and expressionless they could sit on the Britain’s Got Talent panel, if you just pre-programmed them with a dirty laugh.Amanda’s exclusive landfill range has the lot. Piece de resistance, though, has to be her “glass infinity spheres”, which defy any sort of purpose or description, but she had a crack anyway.“They’re, uhm, a bit like those things in the ’80s and ’90s you put fingers and hands on.”Lava lamps? Tamagotchis? Les Dennis? Sadly, we may never know.The afternoon’s real curve ball, though, was introduced by QVC’s endlessly enthusiastic host Pipa Gordon, vis-a-vis lightbulbs: “Amanda, bayonet or screw?”Get back to you, Pipa. I’m just emailing a format idea to ITVBe.Sophie and Sadie both switching their lights off the moment 5ive’s Ritchie Neville burst into song on a celebrity version of Take Me Out.The One Show’s Alex Jones telling David Walliams: “You’re handsome . . . in a different way.”And a dreadful opening to the World Cup being elevated by the brilliant Spain versus Ronaldo game, ITV’s superior selection of pundits and Wrighty, very solemnly assuring us: “I think Suarez has got a big one in him.”—TUESDAY, Good Morning Britain calls in the big diplomatic hitter to comment on the US/North Korea peace deal.Singer Michael Ball: “I would feel better if it wasn’t those two having the conversation.“But there is nothing better than people talking, ’cos . . . ”’Cos love, love changes everything. Hands and faces, earth and sky.AFTER a relatively slow start, Love Island is now in the groove and I am totally immersed. To such an extent that I developed a really strong loathing for a couple of the contestants last week.Namely, Eyal, who’s as ruthless and possessive as the next smirking little berk who claims he’s “spiritual”, and Hayley, a venomous little madam whose description of herself – “I’m cute, funny, feisty, dozy” – is a million miles away from anyone else’s, unless the Theatre Royal St Helens is seriously short of dwarves next Christmas.Fortunately, she’s gone now and there are quite a few of the Islanders that I do actually like.Stationery-obsessed Jack, who has Dancing On Ice 2019 written all over him, top secret Josh, who can’t say too much about his job (taps nose) and Laura, who, like every Scottish woman ever born, is incapable of disguising her feelings, good or bad, and has a biological clock that’s ticking like a Countdown Conundrum.It’s the production that still sets Love Island apart, though, and the fact it’s the only reality show which would drop Beethoven’s Pastoral Symphony into the mix or have the wit to pay off the Alex/Eyal showdown with this news: “Megan had to choose between a man who saves lives with his bare hands and a boy who can walk up and down in a straight line while pouting.“There was only ever going to be one winner.”Brilliant television.Steve Wilson: “Portugal’s big man in the sky is on the pitch.”Alex Scott: “Croatia looked lustlackre.”Glenn Hoddle: “The Ref saw it so he must have been watching.”THIS week’s winner is Gemma Collins and Tiffany from Bride Of Chucky. Sent in by Connor David, via email.Picture research: Alfie Snelling.GOOD Morning Britain, Piers Morgan: “I love salad.”Good Morning Britain, Susanna Reid: “I’m totally neutral when it comes to politics.” (Dyed-in-the-wool BBC left-of-centre about everything).And Love Island, Alex on Megan revealing she’s a stripper: “I think that showed such character and strength.

and men thinking of wearing loafers without socks have be warned they will be turned away.Rupert Adams from William Hill said: Ascot have tightened up the dress code for the royal meeting and many of the millennial generation might not even own socks.The good news is we have 500 special edition socks in our shop on the high street which is close enough that you should not miss any of the action."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000414438912-e1529396107309.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"cambridge students may ball party end of exams","story":"The bright young things let their hair down in traditional fashion after the unis infamous May Ball.The bash sees male students don dinner jackets and their female counterparts sport ball gowns for a night notorious for its heavy drinking.Proceedings begin at Trinity Great Hall with a lavish five-course meal before the students take to the streets in droves.Its the biggest social event of the Cambridge student social calendar and was reliably raucous last night.Revellers partied through the citys streets -

meaning thousands of stressed students are likely to be disappointed with their actual results.This years guinea pig set of youngsters have been tasked with tackling new exams for many subjects.Some revisions came in last year, after a host of reforms from former Education Secretary Michael Gove aimed to toughen up the syllabuses, and 17 more subjects have been changed for this summer.Coursework has been largely done away with for many subjects and the grading changed to be deliberately challenging - with a new 9 to 1 grade system.This was to allow for easier differentiation between stronger and weaker pupils, cut the number of students getting A*s and to streamline the courses.Subjects that have been tweaked include science, geography, history and some languages.But for thousands of schoolkids across the country it has just made the exams harder and the amount of papers they have to sit skyrocket.Teachers have reported they feel they have to cover a huge amount of content for the reformed GCSEs, and pupils have complained they feel the pressure more than ever.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, told the : I think it’s fair to say there is quite a lot of anxiety from young people – they feel as though they are guinea pigs in a new system.“With the new grading system, there is a danger of this being of a lottery when it used to be an expertise.“They haven’t got the backlog of past papers and mark schemes and all those other things to hone their skills and advise students.”Tougher GCSEs are now graded from 1 to 9, with 9 being the highest mark.Coursework and assessment on a module by module basis have been replaced by end of course exams that contain much more challenging content.The exams have been designed to bring England into line with top-performing systems in the Far East and identify academic high-fliers for top universities.They were introduced following a damning 2013 study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.It found England was the only country in the developed world in which adults aged 55 to 65 performed better in literacy and numeracy than those aged 16 to 24. Ofqual, the exams watchdog, said the reforms were designed to raise standards and stay in line with what universities and employers will expect.But some subjects, like the Computer Science GCSE, which replaces Information and Communication Technology, is so much harder pupils are being put off.A report warned the number of girls taking up the subject has dropped, with boys from affluent families who are good at maths the most likely to study it.Department for Education spokesperson said: “We began the process of reforming GCSEs in 2011 to put them on a par with the best in the world so young people are being taught the knowledge and skills they need to prepare them for future success and deliver the skills Britain needs to be fit for the future.“This follows a clear message from employers that the old GCSEs were not preparing young people for the world of work or further study. Teachers and young people have responded well to the introduction of the new qualifications and we trust schools to provide the right support to young people during exam season.”Earlier this month we reported how students were left in floods of tears by this summers GCSE and A-level exams.They have even suffered panic attacks after a shake-up of the system saw some forced to sit over 30 papers.The changes saw 18-year-old vlogger Jade Bowler emerge from her biology A-level in floods of tears.The new exams has seen schools forced to hold early morning revision sessions and some have resorted to sending teachers to anxious pupil’s houses to make sure they turn up, according to The Sunday Times."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000414561556.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"royal ascot 2018 drinking races fans","story":"Well-heeled revellers kicked off the first day of the eagerly anticipated racing event with glasses of champagne and pints of lager as thousands flocked to have a flutter.Ladies donning colourful frocks and gents in top and tails were spotted racing to the Berkshire tracks many bars, as they enjoyed the highlight of the horse racing calendar.In a boisterous mood, some were happy to dance around and pose for photographers, while others preferred to enjoy their drinks on picnic blankets.Armed cops were spotted patrolling the event this morning, ahead of the arrivals of the Queen, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, and other senior royals.However, officers were also on the look-out for any violence between drunken punters – with 300,000 expected to attend over the four-day festival - after violence marred previous meetings at the historic course.In May video footage emerged of a mass brawl, where topless men were seen throwing punches outside a bar at Ascot.While a week later another man was filmed being kicked in the head during a fight at Goodwood races in Sussex.Goodwood chiefs are so sick of the booze-fuelled unsavoury antics that they have limited punters to buying fours drinks one time.However, it is not thought that Ascot has taken similar measures.Thames Valley Police said racegoers should not be alarmed by their heavy presence.Assistant chief constable David Hardcastle said: Aside from our duties protecting the Royal party, the public have come to expect a strong security presence at prominent events and occasions.People should be reassured and not alarmed by the security measures that are being put in place.The public provide our additional eyes and ears and I ask them to support my officers and racecourse security by remaining vigilant, keeping their belongings with them and reporting anything suspicious or unusual to staff or by calling 101."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000413616539.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"italy matteo salvini gypsy census roma question register","story":"Matteo Salvini, 45, who is the Federal Secretary of the country’s far right Northern League, said the measure would be done in a bid to expel any non-Italians.The former MEP, known as ‘Il Capitano’ told the TV station Telelombardia: Unfortunately we will have to keep the Italian Roma because we cant expel them.”Salvini, who heads the right wing, anti-immigration party added: Irregular [undocumented] foreigners will be deported via agreements with other countries.”He said the information would be used to form a “register” of the Roma or gypsy people as the current situation was “chaos”.Salvini said: “I’ve asked the ministry to prepare a dossier on the Roma question in Italy.”In a subsequent statement, Salvini said the government had no intention of setting up a separate archive for the Roma or taking finger prints, but wanted to protect Roma children who were barred from going to local schools by their parents.He added that he wanted to check how European Union funds aimed at helping marginalised communities were being spent.In a tweet, Salvini wrote: “Someone is talking about being shocked. Why? I am thinking of those poor children taught to steal and break laws.”He wrote on his Facebook page earlier today that I dont quit, and added he would put the Italians and their security first.It is not the first time Salvini has hit out at gypsies and has previously called for the camps to be bulldozed and claimed earlier this year the Roma people were “not happy unless they are stealing.”Salvinis comments drew an immediate barrage of criticism, with the centre-left Democratic Party (PD) saying his call revived memories of ethnic cleansing.Roberto Malini, from the charity EveryoneGroup, who campaign for minority group rights compared to the move to Nazi propaganda.He said: “These words, and the call for a register of gypsies, takes us back to the beginnings of Nazism.”Carlo Stasolla, of the July 21 Association, which supports Roma rights said: “The Interior Minister apparently doesn’t know that in Italy a census based on ethnic origin is not legal.”In the 13th and 14th centuries in the principalities of what was Moldavia and Wallachia they were classified as slaves.Spain conducted The Great Roundup of Romani in 1749 with the crown ordering a nationwide raid with able-bodied men interned in labour camps in an attempt of ethnic cleansing.Many European countries also followed a policy of forced assimilation with a number of measures including forcing boys into military service, forcing Roma to register with their local authority, banning marriages and even prohibiting wearing their traditional clothing or speaking their language.Norway in 1896 passed a law permitting the state to remove children from their parents and place them in state institutions with around 1,500 Roma children being removed from their parents.Persecution of the Roma worsened even further in Nazi Germany with gypsies subjected to genocide by Germany and its allies during World War 2, such as Benito Mussolini’s Italy.During the Romani Holocaust, known as Porajmos, gypsies were classified as “enemies of the race-based state” and rounded up and taken to the extermination camps.Along with the Jews, gypsies were also used as human subjects in often horrific experiments.The policy was extended to areas occupied by the Nazis during the war, and it was also applied by their allies, notably Croatia, Romania and Hungary.Estimates vary as to how many Roma were victims of the Holocaust with numbers possibly exceeding one million.Sybil Milton, formerly senior historian of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum has estimated the figure to be between 220,000 and 500,000.Tens of thousands of Roma, live across Italy, many in squalid shantytowns on the outskirts of major cities.Malini estimated there were around 70,000 Italian Roma in the country with between 30-40,000 non-Italian Roma, mainly from Romania.The country has 30 official camps along with around 30 more that are unlicensed. Salvini is part of a new populist coalition government that is in power with the anti-euro Five Star party which has called for the closure of the unlicensed camps and for the Roma children whose parents do not send them to school to be taken into care.In this year’s general election no one party won an outright majority with both the League and the Five Star Movement, led by Luigi Di Maio, emerging as strong political forces as the country lurched away from Matteo Renzi’s centre-left coalition.With no party able to form a stable government there followed months of protracted negotiations to find a solution.The new government was finally sworn in on June 1 and has started pursuing a populist, right wing agenda.It has already promised to deport hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants and stopping boats carrying rescued migrants from docking in Italian ports.Salvini recently prevented the ship Aquarius which was carrying 629 migrants from landing in Italy, forcing it to eventually dock in Valencia, Spain."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/nintchdbpict000369942946.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"home office blasted for releasing 15 year old orphan back into the hands of traffickers","story":"In a damning court judgement it was declared that staff under the-then Home Secretary had failed the Vietnamese boy - who hasnt been seen for almost three years - by not putting in place measures to keep him safe.The Court of Appeal heard that the boy was found in the back of a lorry in Kent in September 2015 with fifteen other young men or boys - six of whom were Vietnamese.Immigration authorities thought he was over 18 and he was detained, with plans to return him to Vietnam.But he told lawyers that he was just 15 and indicated he had been trafficked to the UK via Russia.Lawyers demanded that a package of arrangements should be put in place before he was released which would stop him falling back into the hands of his traffickers.Lord Justice Underhill said he believed that the material before the Secretary of State plainly justified a credible suspicion as at November 6 2015 that the young man was a victim of trafficking and also that he was at risk of being re-trafficked if proper protective measures were not taken.Despite this, he gave them a release address and was allowed to leave a detention centre.Police said he was later seen with another man at Gatwick railway station - and there was no record of him ever reaching the address given, which turned out to be a Buddhist temple.It was only four days later that lawyers found out he had been released.The Prime Minister has promised to make tackling modern slavery a key priority for her Government - but todays case happened under her watch while she was Home Secretary.Campaigners and whistle blowers have revealed dozens of cases of Vietnamese children who have been trafficked to the UK - many of them go on to work in makeshift drug factories growing cannabis.The anti-slavery commission highlighted the problem in a report in 2017, with 1,747 cases being referred to the National Crime Agency between 2009 and 2016.Official estimates suggest there are 20 to 30 million slaves in the modern world.Eight out of ten people trafficked every year are female and half are children.It is overwhelmingly likely that these children have been re-trafficked and are currently being exploited by the people who brought them here, the judgement said.The Courts judgement slammed officials for acting in breach of duty under the European Convention of Human Rights - and said they should have done more to protect him.The boy is believed to have been brought to the UK earlier that year by an agent, who approached him and told him he could earn more working abroad.But as payment for getting him to Britain, he would have to work - but he didnt know what the job was or for how long.Three other people who arrived with him have gone missing from care, and the whereabouts of others are unknown, and the lawyers acting on his behalf are concerned for his safety.The judge today said that the Home Office should look at the case and see whether any lessons could be learned from it.A Home Office spokesperson said of todays ruling.We are carefully considering this judgement.We are committed to doing everything possible to keep adults and children in our care safe, including those identified as potential victims of modern slavery.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The head was right at the bottom, so I didn’t see it at first.“I thought I could see the hint of a comb. And I just thought ‘oh god that’s not a chicken head is it?’“It was surreal. Then I saw its beak and eyes all still intact. It was almost stuck in this frozen silent scream.“With the beak open wide like that and it’s eye kind of looking at you, it made me feel sad.”Bonnie said she has still got the head in her fridge as she doesn’t know what to do with it.She added: “Obviously I know where meat comes from. That’s just the reality of it. But to have it right there in your face especially when I don’t eat meat is very confronting.“I gasped out loud when I saw it, and my son came running over to see what had happened.“He is a vegetarian by his own choice, and I really didn’t want him to see it as I know it would really scare him.“Luckily he didn’t see it as I hid it straight away. I’ve still got the chicken head sitting in the fridge.“I’m not sure what they wanted me to do with it or if I should take it back. But I know I won’t be buying chicken necks from Coles again.”A spokesman for Coles said: “Coles takes the quality of all our products seriously.

The bombs sank against the dam wall before exploding.The Möhne and Edersee Dams were breached causing catastrophic flooding of the Ruhr valley and of villages in the Eder valley.Two hydroelectric power stations were destroyed and several more damaged.

These things matter when you are 92.You have your favourite chair, tea cup and biscuits, and routine is important.Both of these women will have bonded during the overnight journey in the royal train to carry out engagements in ­Cheshire, with the Queen dispensing the solid, common sense advice she has learned the hard way after 66 years on the throne.They might be from ­completely different backgrounds and ­cultures but the Queen and Meghan do have a ­surprising amount in common.Obviously first and foremost they both share a deep love for Prince Harry, but they also have a real sense of duty and a desire to serve.Meghan has a lot more substance than the majority of self-centred young American actresses and, from an early age she has wanted to change the world for the better.This week she became an official partner in The Royal Foundation, joining William and Kate and husband Harry — all dubbed the “Fab Four” ­— to help charities close to their hearts.Meghan wants to make a difference. She doesn’t want to be just a clothes horse or to merely cut ribbons and unveil plaques, and I don’t believe she’d be ­content with just being a mum and virtual stay-at-home housewife like most upper-class wives. She wants to roll up her sleeves and get stuck in.Those who snarkily accuse her of self-promotion are missing the point.Meghan is canny enough to realise her new position in life means she will ­constantly be photographed and written and talked about.She knows that a new hairstyle or frock will steal the headlines but will hope people will also listen to what she has to say on poverty in Africa, equal rights for women and saving elephants.Meanwhile, her old life could be luring Meghan back to La La Land with news that her performance in Suits has been submitted for an Emmy award.A submission is a long way from a nomination, but it will be interesting to see if those in charge fast-track her into the awards category for best actress. ­Personally, I don’t think it will happen.Even Meghan would admit she wasn’t by any stretch of the imagination the best actor in Suits.If Meghan was nominated and ended up winning, it would be nothing more than a stunt to get some sort of seal of royal approval.Surely even the US entertainment industry wouldn’t be that cynical.Since Meghan met Harry, she has been compared to Grace Kelly, the Hollywood star who gave up her career to marry Prince Rainier III of Monaco.Unlike Grace Kelly, who wanted to go back into movies, I don’t see Meghan being in any way tempted back to her old life after landing the best role of all.That’s not a criticism because I admire her work ethic and single-mindedness — and I think her desire to be a force for good is genuine.The Queen is nobody’s fool and if she thinks Meghan is worth cultivating and training, the new ­American Duchess should have our approval, too.THE two new judges being wooed to join The X Factor could very well save this show’s rather tired-looking format.Robbie Williams is an inspired choice, bringing his own brand of cheeky humour but also a real empathy for all those seeking fame and fortune.I reckon, however, his wife Ayda could prove to be the real star.She’s funny, feisty and has proved to be a TV favourite during her appearances on Loose Women.Ayda won’t take any nonsense from the formidable Simon Cowell and, much as she loves Robbie, you can expect some straight-talking spats between them.Of course there are those who will say she’s only getting a seat on the judges’ panel because of her husband’s fame, but I reckon Ayda , left with Robbie, is more than up to the job and will be a much needed breath of fresh air on a panel that was looking increasingly bored and out of touch.ON World Blood Donor Day this week I repaid my debt to the NHS when my fantastic TV show team donated their very own blood (having already given their sweat and tears on a daily basis).I had to have a life-saving three pints of blood after a serious accident and, like every other patient who is given a transfusion, I am no longer allowed to donate my own.Where can I give blood? Here’s how to find a donation centre and how often you’re able to donateIt’s something that has made me feel very guilty, so I cannot thank my team enough – although there would have been even more of the precious life-saving blood if some of the boys who work with me and happen to be gay had not been banned from donating.Gay men who have had recent sex are not allowed to be donors, which surely is an edict that needs to be changed.There has to be a way to ensure safety without making gay men feel like pariahs.IN Hollywood, money talks and the box office dictates trends.So It’s good news that the all-female Ocean’s 8 has trounced the other male-dominated movies in the franchise, because it clearly shows moviegoers WILL happily pay to see films starring women in leading roles.Ocean’s 8 is a rather silly but hugely enjoyable spin on the heist movie with a satisfying end twist and decent parts for women – who are all too often usually “the wife” or “the best friend”.It shows that the appallingly bad all-girl version of Ghostbusters, a real stinker that bombed horribly, was just a blip.Hopefully, this will be the start of more big- budget films with kick-ass roles for women that aren’t twee or patronising.ALL my fellow Holby City fans know that surgeon Jac Naylor would make a polar bear shiver if she gave it one of her “looks”.She’s the ultimate ice maiden, although we have seen a little bit of a thaw in recent weeks on her return to our screens.In fact, Jac showed her human side when the character had a breakdown on screen, something that Rosie Marcel, who has played the character for 13 years, knows all about.Rosie told me that she suffered her own mental health problems after having a real-life breakdown on set.She suffered from depression and had to seek medical help.Rosie walked out of her house in her pyjamas and bare feet and even had the dark thought that her family would be better off without her.Luckily, she was given treatment and was able to get back to work, but it was a frightening time and demonstrates once again that mental health problems can hit anyone.I salute Rosie for being so open and brave about her struggle.FASTEN your seatbelts, it’s going to be a bumpy ride in Poldark when the admirable Rebecca Front sails into Truro harbour like a magnificent galleon as the formidable Lady Whitworth.This ghastly harridan is the mother of the monstrous Ossie Whitworth, who has made his reluctant wife Morwenna suffer the torments of hell and even had his wicked way with her sister.If you wondered how Ossie could be so self-centred, heartless and cruel, then all will be explained when his mother heaves into view.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Say it. Sorted.”Endless repetition probably cost her a million votes in last year’s catastrophic snap election and earned her the label “MayBot”.She did it again while hailing her long-overdue £380million-a-week Brexit boost for the health service.Her NHS treatment for diabetes helped her “get on with my job”, she said.Except, it didn’t. Her Type 1 diabetes deserves sympathy and understanding, but it has nothing to do with her job as PM.To lead is to choose. Mrs May chose to lead but suffers paralysis by analysis.Since achieving her dream of leading this country, Mrs May has failed to make the right choices at a pivotal moment in British history.As a sceptical Remainer, she was perfectly placed to steer Britain through the complex task of leaving the European Union.Her first act should have been to summon her Cabinet and tell them “Brexit means Brexit”, which means every minister and Whitehall mandarin must work their socks off to make it a success.And while staring Chancellor Phil Hammond in the eye, invite anyone who felt otherwise to find another job.Instead, she boxed herself in by triggering a rigid Brexit timetable, slapping £39BILLION cash on the table and inviting Brussels’ biggest bullies to do their worst.And they did. Any idea this would be a friendly divorce has turned to ashes. We are at war with Europe, if only by another name.This week we are likely to see their Commons cats’-paws, the increasingly triumphant Remoaners, take Mrs May and the UK to the brink of abject surrender.We are being forced to repeal the verdict of our biggest ever single-issue vote by screeching siren Anna “Suck it up” Soubry and hypocrite Tory lawyer Dominic Grieve, who yesterday said he and fellow rebels were prepared to bring down the Government if they are not granted a “meaningful vote” on the final Brexit deal.Obnoxious Soubry gives even Remainers a bad name, resorting to reckless slurs of “racism” even as her precious European Union is being torn apart by rows over uncontrolled mass immigration.She shrugs off the real grounds for scepticism about Brussels — its sneering contempt for democracy and the misbegotten euro, which has destroyed the job hopes of a generation of young Europeans.These were the failures which actually led to Brexit, long before Tony Blair flung open the door to 4million foreign migrants and German Chancellor Angela Merkel raised the stakes with a million more.It was Merkel, as much as Blair and David Cameron, who soured the public view of Europe’s Grand Project years before Brexit ever became a possibility.But while it is easy to condemn defeated Remoaners as sore losers, it is hard not to be impressed by their organisational zeal, which would do credit to Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxist militia.By stark contrast, all of those who voted Out — and won — are entitled to be outraged by the performance of the Cabinet’s victorious Brexiteers.What the hell have they been doing for the past 18 months?They have been caught flat-footed, ambushed in the night, bound and gagged by a richly funded, highly motivated mob of undemocratic contemptibles. They should be shot for sleeping on the job.Boris trumpets the occasional bugle call. David Davis threatens to quit once a month. Michael Gove is busy elsewhere. And Liam Fox?They never talk to each other, prepare strategy or organise tactics, let alone mobilise financial backing or communicate with 17.4million supporters. Do they too think we are all thick and racistNow we risk the horrifying prospect of remaining half-in, half-out of the EU, robbed of our vote, our hard-won rebate and £39billion in hard cash.The game may be lost by default to the dark forces of organised bureaucracy: The Civil Service, the BBC, EU pensioners such as Peter Mandelson and those faceless Eurocrats.We shot their fox in The Glorious Referendum, only to let them regroup and return as a pack of wolves with a scent of blood.They had to suck it up or risk choking on the toxic fumes.But I think it sounds more like the punchline to a particularly revolting joke which is unsuitable for a family newspaper like this.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government will publish a “statement of intent” outlining the first details of the “settled status” scheme, which will apply to Britain’s 3.4 million EU citizens if they want to stay.  Former Home Secretary Amber Rudd infamously claimed the process would be “as easy as setting up an online account at LK Bennett” - a posh shoe shop.  But what do we already know about the rights available to EU citizens in the UK - and how they’ll change? Here’s everything we know so far.  Britain and Brussels have agreed EU nationals can continue arriving, working and settling in the UK until December 2020. This will also apply the other way round. But it\u0027s not yet known what rights people will get if they arrive after that. It\u0027s been suggested EU citizens will get preferential immigration rights compared to people from the rest of the world, but that\u0027s not confirmed. What about EU citizens already in the UK?  More than 3million EU citizens already live in the UK. They spent months not knowing what would happen, but now it\u0027s confirmed. During 2018, the Home Office will launch an application system for EU nationals seeking to remain in Britain after Brexit. Those who have been in the country for five years by the end of 2020 will be able to apply for settled status - meaning they are free to continue living and working in the UK. People who have arrived by December 31, 2020, but do not have five years\u0027 residence, will be able to apply to stay until are eligible to apply for the status. What about British citizens who live in the EU now?  More than 1million British citizens live in the other 27 EU countries. They will have the same rights to stay there as EU citizens have to stay in the UK. But it\u0027s not clear if they\u0027ll lose the right to move around and settle in any of the other 26 EU countries. Perhaps for this reason, applications for foreign citizenship - especially in Germany - have soared since the Brexit vote. And it\u0027s worth noting that among the British citizens that have applied for French residency since the Brexit vote is....Lord Lawson, the former chairman of the Vote Leave campaign.

The social media giant\u0027s UK public policy manager Karim Palant sat stony faced as Labour\u0027s Helen Jones tore into him in Parliament. She told him: “If we feel we do not have enough time to question you this afternoon then we will recall you and if necessary we will issue a summons. You have given the impression that your company does not feel it has to be scrutinised and, frankly, that it has something to hide. In doing so, you have done them no service at all. Young men in your company may play games you do not play games with the House of Commons. I hope I have made that entirely clear and that we don\u0027t run up against this behaviour again.”  Mr Palant folded one had over another as he absorbed the humiliating dressing down, raising his eyebrows in shock towards the end.  Ms Jones, chairwoman of the Commons Petitions Select Committee, blasted: “Your company has indulged in behaviour towards this committee which we find totally unacceptable. On May 15 Facebook agreed to give evidence on June 5.  Then with three days\u0027 notice they informed us that they wanted to be here today with other companies, thus making sure we couldn\u0027t have two split evidence sessions we had intended. When our clerk said that wasn\u0027t acceptable, we were suddenly told that the member of staff who was coming had gone on annual leave – something which you will understand we treat with some scepticism given the circumstances. I am also aware that your company\u0027s behaviour to other select committees in this House has been less than helpful, taking a long time to send them information they requested, changing witnesses and so on. I want to make it very clear that your company will not be able to avoid democratic scrutiny, it is not acceptable to try and disrupt a committee\u0027s inquiry – and that you do not dictate the terms of engagement, elected members do.” Mr Palant was denied a chance to defend himself and vowed to write to the committee with “a correction to the record”. During the 101-minute session, Mr Palant and executives from Twitter and Google explained how they were trying to tackle trolls who target the disabled. But Labour MP Mike Hill said: “Some of our witnesses, including Katie Price, have told us they don’t get feedback when they report abuse. “Sometimes, as she said, they have to go and find out themselves what’s happened regarding abuse and whether it’s been removed.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn ready prime minister","story":"NewsJeremy Corbyn is ready to be Prime Minister, says Wales\u0027 First Minister and Welsh Labour boss Carwyn JonesCarwyn Jones backed the UK Labour leader for No 10\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByBen GlazeDeputy political editor21:00, 19 JUN 2018NewsJeremy Corbyn received the endorsement from one of the party\u0027s big beasts (Image: Getty)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJeremy Corbyn is ready to be Prime Minister, one of Labour’s most powerful politicians declares today.  Outgoing Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones backed the party’s UK leader for No 10 as the hapless Government struggles with its Brexit negotiations.  He is the right man to “reject the mess the Tories are making”, said Mr Jones, who steps down as First Minister and Welsh Labour leader in December after nine years. Asked if he thought Mr Corbyn was ready for Downing Street, he told the Mirror: “Yes I do.”  In an exclusive Mirror interview, he urged the Labour leader to work harder to attract older voters. And Mr Jones also fuelled claims he wants a seat in the House of Lords after he stands down. Endorsing Mr Corbyn for Downing Street, Mr Jones pointed to the party chief’s recent success in highlighting Brexit splits at the top of Government. He said: “I think he struck a very, very telling blow on the Prime Minister making the point about the weakness of the current UK Cabinet. “At the moment we have what seems to be several different Prime Ministers who are trying to run the country, and Jeremy would be a better alternative than any of them.”  Mr Jones has had a sometimes tense relationship with Labour’s London-based operation. There was widespread dismay at what Cardiff saw as Mr Corbyn’s lack of enthusiasm to campaign to Remain in the EU in the 2016 referendum. But he stunned critics at last year’s snap general election, denying the Tories a majority and boosting his own position. Asked how Mr Corbyn could win more support and propel Labour to office, Mr Jones urged: “He needs to stick to his guns - it worked. “It was a very curious election campaign, it started off very difficult and it changed when Theresa May launched her party’s manifesto - and it changed because Jeremy went out there and really thumped the tub and spoke to so many people.  “He got a lot of young people particularly on his side.” Mr Jones pinpointed two areas his UK counterpart needed to target to win power. “Firstly the Midlands, where we didn’t do well in the election, and secondly, we’ve got to work on a very strong package for older people because clearly older people – they didn’t as a rule vote for us, younger people did,” he said. “I don’t think we have to make a choice between the older and younger generation, so we really have to work hard as a party on offering a very good package for people who are a lot older.” Mr Jones announced his decision to quit as FM and Welsh Labour leader in April, amid ongoing criticism of his handling of allegations against former Welsh Assembly Cabinet Minister Carl Sargeant.  Mr Sargeant took his own life in November, days after being suspended by Labour. An inquest will examine the circumstances of his death. Speaking about his decision to resign, Mr Jones said the “time was right” and insisted he was quitting “at a time of my own choosing”, adding: “That in politics is unusual.” He hopes to be remembered as a politician who attracted huge foreign investment into Wales, and “as the person who moved Wales from being a country that had an Assembly with very limited powers to a proper parliament with proper powers that the people of Wales deserved – and that we used those powers in that people would have wanted”. But asked how he thinks he will be remembered, he admitted: “It’s for other people to judge, I suppose.” Mr Jones is tipped for the House of Lords after giving up his Bridgend seat at the next Assembly election.

She was the most famous woman in south America. But when drug lord Pablo Escobar met beautiful television journalist Virginia Vallejo they fell in love. His pursuit by the authorities and violent enemies made secrecy a necessity - but as rumours of their closeness circulated, the affair destroyed her career and almost cost her life. With Pablo I lose my reason, and with me he loses his head and then all that\u0027s left is a man pursued by justice and a woman pursued by the media who know and take care of and need each other, despite the pain caused by all the absences, all his crimes and her sins, Virginia later wrote in her book about the relationship.  Over the course of their tempestuous love affair Virginia would come to witness first-hand the bloodshed, fear and corruption that accompanied the rise of Escobar\u0027s crime empire. She had a ringside seat for the drugs, sex, wealth and violence and watched as her married lover went from rising politician who was loved by the poor to a desperate paranoid fugitive who was the most wanted man in the world until his death in a hail of bullets. Escobar - the criminal Escobar is widely regarded as a monster beyond belief. He masterminded the bombing of an airliner in which 107 people died, the murders of three presidential candidates, dozens of judges, journalists and politicians. And hundreds of innocent civilians were killed in scores of bombings. Yet in his native Colombia, Escobar was idolised by the poor because he shrewdly built them homes, roads, sports stadiums and provided thousands of jobs. When he and Virginia met in 1982, he was a young congressman with hopes for high political office and the source of his wealth was still a mystery. Still to come were the mass murders, violent shoot outs with police, political assassinations and thousands of deaths caused as a result of his business producing most of the world\u0027s cocaine.  In her book Virginia paints a picture of a strong, commanding and ruthless businessman a long way from the image of a fugitive rat hiding out in run down farms and barely seeing daylight which characterised the months in the run up to his death in 1993. Her portrayal in Netflix\u0027s Narcos The Netflix TV show Narcos alluded to the relationship with the character \u0027Valeria Velez\u0027, played by Stephanie Sigman, allegedly based on Virginia - although she is unhappy with the association.  She told the Mirror exclusively: My portrayal in Narcos  is as a pervert, and a criminal and corrupt journalist that in the end is tortured and killed.  The purpose of the script was to defame me brutally and rape me in front of millions of people.   Instead she has high hopes for the film of her book Loving Pablo, Hating Escobar , which stars Javier Bardem and Pen\u0026eacutelope Cruz.  As well as his dark side Virginia describes her former lover\u0027s generosity and free spending and details dozens of meetings including an extraordinary visit to one of the drug lord\u0027s jungle haciendas. Whilst at the house she visited his private zoo complete with elephants, hippopotamuses, rhinoceros, giraffes, zebras, camels, kangaroos and Appaloosa horses. And swimming in a river on his estate Virginia reveals a brush with death when says she got sucked into a whirlpool and was rescued by Escobar. She writes: Without a second thought he leaps into the water and reaches me in seconds. First, he uses words to calm me then, movements so precise they seem choreographed and finally, a strength that seems equal to whirlpool\u0027s to pull me out. And that confident, brave man snatches me from the arms of death as if I was a feather, as if that act were just one more responsibility of a gallant host, and as if he were immune to a danger that he brushes aside. At the time of the meeting Virginia says she had a boyfriend but his addiction to cocaine was to bring the relationship to an end - ironically bearing in mind she would soon find herself in the arms of the most famous dealer of that drug in history.  As a famous television host she was used to mixing with the wealthy elite and had a string of handsome suitors, but she was captivated by Escobar. It was by most people\u0027s experience of a romance an extraordinarily unusual relationship, with meetings between them conducted in secrecy and long gaps of up to three months with no contact as Escobar went to ground. When the couple met Virginia says she was still technically married to her ex-husband who was refusing to sign divorce papers. When Escobar heard about this he simply told her he would fix it within 48 hours. She writes: When I come home for lunch my housekeeper informs me my lawyer called three times. When I call him, he exclaims, \u0027Your husband called this morning, desperate to tell me he had to sign the divorce papers before noon, or he was dead. \u0027The poor guy was as pale as wax and shaking like a leaf he looked like he was about to have a heart attack. He almost couldn\u0027t sign his name.\u0027 The next day Escobar sent six men bearing huge bouquets of flowers to her apartment as a sign of his regard. She described how on one occasion Escobar turned up at her apartment with dozens of bodyguards who all insisted on coming to the front door of her apartment with him. She said she reacted so furiously to the invasion of her privacy that he always left them downstairs in future.  She said: Over the years I will see Pablo some 220 times, around 80 of them surrounded by an army of friends, followers, employees or bodyguards. But starting after that day he will arrive at either of our apartments or my hotel suite completely alone, and when we meet in his country houses, he will order his men to vanish before they see me. His extravagant lifestyle Her book of the affair contains some fascinating details of the trappings of Escobar\u0027s wealth including a description of a James Bond car full of gadgets. She recounts Escobar describing it: This button lets out a cloud of smoke that throws off anyone chasing you this one releases tear gas that leaves them coughing and desperate for water, that one pours oil so they slide in zig zag and go off a cliff this one drops hundreds of tacks and nails to puncture their tyres this is a flame-thrower that you activate after this one sprays gasoline that one sets off explosives, and on either side are the machine guns. And if all that fails to work, this last button emits a frequency that destroys the eardrum.  She described how he had a string of private Lear jets which he would use to summon her in or send her to New York to go shopping with thousands of dollars in spending money. Also how he had 14 passports all with pictures of him in different disguises so he could evade detection. Over the course of their relationship Escobar, who was married to wife Victoria throughout his affair, confided in Virginia about his business and introduced her to his business associates. But his confidences carried a potential cost as his enemies would have loved to access his secrets. To protect her he gave her a nine-millimeter Beretta pistol engraved with his initials with the instructions: I am going to teach you how to shoot yourself so you die right away. Protection He warned her she would be tortured if captured and only to shoot any potential kidnappers if they were unarmed and less than five in number. She writes: He shows me what to do, where to place my fingers and where, exactly, to put the barrel. Again and again he pulls the trigger, again and again he pulls the trigger until I can\u0027t stand the pain anymore and I learn not to let myself be disarmed. While I observe in the mirror images of our two naked bodies fighting for control of the gun, I can\u0027t help thinking of two Spartan wrestlers. He forces me to feel terror, then lose my fear, to take control, to imagine the pain... to die of love. The couple had a passionate physical relationship and on one occasion he asked her to write down what she felt when they made love. She writes: On our next encounter I give him five and a half pages, and I sit watching him, not looking away for a second, while he devours them. He tells me, \u0027But...this is the most salacious thing I have read in my entire life. Honestly... this\u0027ll give me multiple erections.\u0027 Virginia paints a picture of two people in love with the future full of possibilities until Escobar ordered the murder of Rodrigo Lara, the Colombian minister for justice, who had been targeting drug traffickers. His death shocked the nation and led to the Government approving the extradition law which would have led to Escobar being sent to the United States had he been captured alive. It led instead to Escobar\u0027s activities becoming increasingly violent and in turn him being sought even harder by the authorities.  As the authorities turned their attentions more on catching Escobar and his associates, Virginia began to get threatening phone calls. More negative stories appeared in the media about her links to Escobar and drug barons and her TV contract was not renewed. The glamorous TV host, who now lives in Florida, says she was deeply in love with Escobar but her feelings changed as he became more brutal. The turning point A turning point in their relationship came in November 1985, when guerrilla group M19, financed by Escobar, stormed Colombia’s Palace of Justice and held all 25 of the country\u0027s Supreme Court justices and hundreds of other civilians hostage. M19 opposed the government’s move toward extraditing Colombians to the US, a point on which the rebels and Colombia’s powerful drug traffickers, led by Escobar, agreed. Over the next two days, the Colombian army mounted an operation to retake the building and free the hostages.  By the time the crisis was resolved, almost all of the 30 to 40 rebels were dead, scores of hostages had been killed or “disappeared”, and 11 of the court’s 25 justices had been murdered.  Records for about 6,000 criminal cases were destroyed, including files for the criminal case against the cartel boss Escobar. Virginia wrote: I wonder if the man I had thought was the bravest of all has become merely the most cowardly of the monsters. I change my phone number, and with my soul shrunken by terror, I make the decision never to see Pablo Escobar again in my life. Overnight, I have stopped loving him. Goodbye Virginia did see Escobar again but the relationship was over and they had minimal contact.  In the book she describes the last time she saw Escobar in 1987: We stop a few feet from the hotel door, and we say goodbye forever. We both know it is the last time I will see him alive. He puts his hand behind my neck and kisses me on the forehead for the last time. In complete silence, he and I caress each other\u0027s face for the last time. With eyes full only of infinite absences, he and I look at each other for the last time.  He contemplates me a few seconds with those eyes that seem to contain every danger and announce every tragedy, his sad black eyes that seem to carry, every tiredness, every condemnation. And so that he will forever remember me as I always was, before I get out of the car I make a superhuman effort to swallow my tears, and give him my last, fleeting kiss, the last of my radiant smiles, my last couple of affectionate pats, and a look that can only offer him all those simple things that Billie Holiday\u0027s dreamy voice sang in I\u0027ll Be Seeing You. They would speak again on the telephone but Escobar had grown bitter and Virginia was scared for her life because of what she knew of his empire.

But when he returned home his mum Juliet Ryan spotted vile messages, including the n-word and other derogatory terms written all over the shirt. The boy, who does not want to be named, has been left shocked and shaken and police are now investigating. Mum-of-two Juliet, 47, said: In no way was this a joke of playful banter.

Juliet, who is CEO of a homeless charity, says her son is the only black pupil in his year and has suffered previous racial abuse at the school. She immediately complained to the headteacher who has launched an inquiry which will include a review of CCTV footage. It is understood the incident happened in the school\u0027s restaurant.

However 37 per cent believe their fantasy car is nothing but a pipe dream and are resigned to NEVER possessing such a vehicle. But when it comes to their next motor, the 2,000 drivers surveyed are in no doubt about the dream features it would have – including a panoramic sunroof, heated seats and sat-nav. Assisted driving tech such as parking sensors, automatic braking systems and remote start would be important too.  And for one in 10, a cup holder would be an absolute must. A spokesperson for Hyundai said: “As the research shows, many of us long to own a truly amazing car but unfortunately a vast number don’t think they ever will. “Of course, this doesn’t stop us wondering what our dream car would – or will – be like and clearly we have pretty fixed ideas of what our next car would at least have.” Preferences also differ somewhat according to age with 18-24 year olds especially keen that their next car features tech such as Bluetooth, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Whereas those aged 48 plus are more concerned with features which improve safety and aid driving such as demisting mirrors, automatic braking systems and parking sensors.  Interestingly, men and women want very similar things when it comes to their next car – although the number one requirement for men is air conditioning while parking sensors are a must for females. The findings emerged as it was revealed 35 per cent of those polled buy the first car they go to see when shopping for a new motor. And around one fifth will only check out two vehicles before making a decision. The research also identified the factors we take into account when purchasing a new motor, with price at the top of the list. Factors such as reliability and fuel type are also popular among those polled, in addition to fuel economy and CO2 emissions.  On the flipside, it also emerged that there are certain things that annoy people about their current cars. The most common being scratches and dents, size, how much it costs to fill up with fuel and how slowly it accelerates. Others are fed-up with smelly air con, poor visibility out of the rear window and being unable to get the radio to work. Amid this, four in 10 have bought a car and regretted it later.  Carried out through OnePoll , the research also found the typical motorist has owned six cars to date with their first one costing \u0026pound1,596.10 on average.  In contrast, their current vehicle on average costed \u0026pound11,313.28.

Jamie Elliot was over the limit when he started driving the propelled vehicle with a passenger on board in the early hours of May 29.  A court heard how the 18-year-old had been out drinking when he took the golf buggy from the nearby Catterick Golf Club in North Yorkshire and attempted to take it into the drive-thru, which is over a mile away. The incident received widespread coverage after North Yorkshire Police posted a picture of the buggy and described it as the most unusual job of the night. Elliot admitted one count of driving while unfit through drink and was handed the 12-month driving ban and ordered to pay a total of \u0026pound235 in fines and court costs on Tuesday.  He was told that by magistrates in Northallerton that, should he complete a rehabilitation course by the end of January next year, the length of the ban would be reduced. Prosecutor Sarah Tyrer told the court how officers first arrived at the scene when they were informed by staff at the McDonald\u0027s that they had spotted Elliot in the buggy. Mr Elliot confirms that he had taken the golf buggy from the Catterick Golf Course, Ms Tyrer told the court. The prosecutor also claimed that the teenager would have had to have opened a secure shed in order to access the vehicle and had therefore been given a caution for taking without consent. When he was taken to a nearby police station, Elliot was breathalysed and gave a reading of 47 micrograms of alcohol for every 100 millilitres of breath, the legal limit being 35.

Ex-MP for Beckenham Brian Cooke sparked outrage when he branded the three men - one aged 19, two 23 - as common scum and criminals.  They were named on the London street art scene by their tags of Lover, Kbag and Trip, and the families of two of the victims - Harrison Scott-Hood, 23, and Alberto Fresneda Carrasco, 19 - have paid tribute to them.

The men were believed to have been hit by an overnight freight train as they spray-painted walls at a vandalism hotspot - the cans were found littered on the track, alongside their bodies, at 7.30am yesterday. Furious critics hit back at Mr Cooke, with one responding: What a horrible \u0026amp disgraceful thing to say. They\u0027re people\u0027s sons, show some respect.  Another added: Three lives lost, undoubtedly a traumatised train driver...shame on you for such reckless and thoughtless comments and opinion on a tragedy spare a thought for their families before you type. It is not the first time the former MP has found himself in hot water after sharing his outspoken views - he was suspended from the post in May this year after branding a former mayor a two-faced s***.

He arrived in the city with his friends at the end of 2011, in time of the Olympic Games.  Our most emotional memories of him was the basketball final between the United States and Spain.  As a child he played football in a local team in London, his heart was divided between Everton and Sevilla.  From a very young age, his passion was to draw. He was ready to study graphic design at the London College of Communication (LCC) from September.  In recent years, he showed interest in the world of fashion and came up with a brand with his own designs.  Another of his hobbies was buying clothes in charity shops and reselling it on the internet. He had a special eye for business.  His absence has left a deep hole in the family.  His mother Isabel, his father Carlos and his bothers Miguel, 21, and Julio, 14, appreciate the support and ask that their privacy be respected in these specially sad times for us and for the city.

That means in their tot\u0027s first 12 months, exhausted mums and dads will sleep 59 per cent less than the recommended eight hours a night, losing the equivalent of 50 nights of kip. It also emerged a typical parent spends 54 minutes per day trying to get their baby to sleep, adding up to almost 14 days in their first year. Furthermore mums and dads will also pace the equivalent of two miles while rocking their baby each day and night, totting up to 730 miles – the equivalent of 28 marathons – over a 365-day period. The study also found with the average new-born waking three times a night when they first arrive home, sleep deprivation can take an emotional toll on relationships.  More than two thirds of British parents believe they have got into arguments with their partner purely as a result of their baby’s poor sleep habits. Steve Reid, CEO and Co-Founder for sleep technology brand Simba, which commissioned the study, said: “As a new parent myself, the fallout from sleeplessness as a parent can be overwhelming and can push you to the limits, which is why we’ve been meticulous in crafting the new Simba Hybrid\u0026reg Cot Mattress. “Sleep nourishment, plays a vital role in the recuperation, growth, immune system, brain development and learning of a child and having put the cot mattress through rigorous independent testing, the results speak for themselves.  “Nine out of 10 babies fall asleep faster on a Simba, with three out of four sleeping longer too – gifting parents with a much-needed additional hour of sleep every night. “When your baby sleeps well, you sleep better and that sets everyone up for the day. Investing in the right mattress is just as important for babies as it is for adults.” The study also found 23 per cent of those polled believe the lost sleep in their child’s first year at home led them to behave \u0027slightly unusually\u0027.  In their sleep-deprived state, 11 per cent have hallucinated something which wasn’t really there, and 44 per cent have completely forgotten what they were saying mid-sentence. Eight per cent have even forgotten the name of their baby. Sixty-four per cent look back on their first year as parents and are \u0027amazed\u0027 they were able to function through it all as well as they did. In those early months, one third of new parents believe warm milk is the best remedy for settling a restless baby.  Thirty two per cent found their little one slept best when they were rocked to sleep in their arms, and one in five got their baby a comfort blanket to keep them cosy while they snoozed. Hope Bastine, resident psychologist for Simba said, “We spend hours poring over the nutritional value of food because we know it’s essential for baby’s development. But how often do we pause to consider the nutritional value of a well-balanced home?  “Sleep is an equally rich nutrient in a child’s formative years. And the ingredients of your nursery and getting it ‘night-right’ can mean the difference between a happy day and a grisly one.” Steve Reid added, “Testing has revealed the Simba Hybrid\u0026reg cot mattress is 400 per cent more supportive than other leading high street cot mattresses. “And with Simba babies waking on average once less each night, we’re also confident that your new-born will be getting quality slumber. “Everyone deserves the best night’s sleep. We’ve applied the same big thinking and Simba engineering prowess that people love, and re-imagined it for the smallest and most sensitive members of the family, ensuring bones and bodies are completely supported right from day one.” "},{"url":null,"title":"not football fan here how","story":"AdvertorialNot a football fan?

THAT tournament in Russia which is dominating the airwaves will see 32 teams take part in 64 matches over the course of more than a month. That\u0027s a lot of joy if you love the sport… and a lot of matches to avoid if you don\u0027t. But let\u0027s not complain or grumble - let’s see this as an opportunity instead. For those who don’t love football, the international tournament presents the perfect chance to sample the lovely and amazing things on offer right here in the UK. Avoid: 24 June, England vs Panama  Unlike England’s opening match against Tunisia, their second match is at the weekend on a Sunday afternoon. This of course means excitement will be at fever pitch and the country will be talking about little else. For someone with less interest in football, that means escape will be necessary. And the spectacular beauty of the Lake District could be the solution - it gives you soul-nourishing views and less chance of having to watch a football match.  We recommend Scafell Pike in Cumbria. It\u0027s the highest mountain in England at 978m above sea level and an area of unbelievable beauty with countless campsites and other places to stay. We can\u0027t promise you\u0027ll avoid the football entirely, but there\u0027s a fair bet you can if you want to. Ideal for hiking, canoeing and climbing there\u0027s loads to do in the Lake District and lots of beauty to see. It\u0027s worth doing some water-based activities in the lake at the foot of Scafell Pike - it\u0027s England\u0027s deepest lake at 258 feet.  Mind you, it\u0027s dwarfed by the depth of Lock Morar in Scotland, which is 1,017 feet deep. It\u0027s worth mentioning that the deepest a human has dived in scuba gear is 1,090 feet! See, you\u0027ve already forgotten about the football and you haven\u0027t been yet...  Don\u0027t forget to take: The Aerobie Squidgie Disc , \u0026pound5.50, for a non-football activity to keep the family entertained. For camping you can’t beat the Halfords Vis a Vis Tent which is now \u0026pound60, was \u0026pound150 (save \u0026pound90). It\u0027s perfect for families or groups of friends, with two separate bedrooms and a living area which provides some extra space for your essential kit.  Avoid: 28 June, England vs Belgium  Instead of sitting through England’s final group game, why not visit Wales instead? After all, the Welsh aren\u0027t in the tournament this time around, so they\u0027re likely to be as keen to ignore it as you. We specifically love the village of Llanwddyn, below, which, in the 1880s, was forever submerged when a new reservoir was created in the Vyrnwy valley. The purpose of Lake Vyrnwy was to supply Liverpool with fresh water, which is something it still does to this day. It\u0027s also a nature reserve and offers amazing access to nature - perfect for a picnic.  Look out for the gothic straining tower, which filters the water before it heads off toward Liverpool. There are also a number of RSPB hides around the lake, from which you can spot some of the birds which inhabit the area. You\u0027ll also find loads of excellent picnic spots to watch the world go by. A road runs around the perimeter of the reservoir too, which is often used by runners and could easily be great for a family bike ride, if everyone is confident on the road.   Don\u0027t forget to take: Picnics are a lot better when you’re comfortable, so grab the Halfords XL Waterproof Picnic Blanket for everyone to sit on - now half price at \u0026pound10. Remember to take the Plastic Plates , Bowls , Plastic Set of Tumblers and Cutlery – all half price at \u0026pound3 each.    If you’re interested in cycling the road, the Carrera Parva Hybrid Bike will see you up even the toughest of hills, thanks to its larger 27.5 wheels and 21 speed Shimano Tourney gears. It\u0027s available in both men and women ’s configurations and is only \u0026pound210 (save \u0026pound90).    For the kids, good choices are the Apollo Kinx Junior Hybrid Bike ,  which has a cool floral design- or the racer red Apollo Vortice Junior Hybrid Bike . Both are currently reduced to just \u0026pound104 (was \u0026pound130, save \u0026pound26) and the Shimano 18 speed gears will let them fearlessly tackle every hill they encounter.  Avoid: 2 \u0026amp 3 July, potential England game in Last 16  Should England qualify from the group stage and make it to the knockout stage of the competition, this is where the wall-to-wall football coverage will go into overdrive, making it nigh on impossible to avoid discussion of England’s prospects. Instead, perhaps you should consider some of England\u0027s amazingly beautiful woodland.  Swinley Forest in Berkshire contains a set of exciting mountain bike trails that are fun for the whole family. There are three routes in total: a green for beginners, blue for more advanced cyclists and a red for proficient mountain bikers. It\u0027s the ideal day out for anyone who likes cycling more than football. An adventure playground and spaces to build your own fort finish off this ideal location for family fun.  Don\u0027t forget to take: Make the most of the Swinley Forest mountain bike trails on the Carrera Sulcata Mountain Bike - available for both men and women now \u0026pound340, was \u0026pound425 (save \u0026pound85). A hefty cycle offroad is going to make you really ready for a hearty lunch.   The kids will have no trouble keeping up on the Carrera Blast Junior Mountain Bike , \u0026pound260. It\u0027s a great choice for kids graduating up to their first mountain bike, with its lightweight junior fit Carrera alloy frame for a light and easy ride.   Alternatively, the Carrera Luna Junior Mountain Bike with 24 wheel is \u0026pound232, (was \u0026pound290, save \u0026pound58). It has a lightweight frame with 21 speed gears and a Suntour Alloy M3020 suspension fork to help take on all terrains.  Avoid: 6 \u0026amp 7 July, quarter-finals  Many experts expect England to reach the last eight of the tournament, which would make this their biggest match of the competition - and an excuse for a national festival of football. If that’s not for you, down in Cornwall, below, there are plenty of places to enjoy the outdoors, and specifically the beach. Usually free of TVs and thus the football, these beaches are a haven for the non-sports-fan, and the soft sand and crashing waves make it the ideal place to swim during the day and barbecue a little later.  Check before you light the charcoal but many Cornish beaches allow non-gas barbecues, as long as they are raised off the ground on legs. It\u0027s also often a requirement that you wait until the early evening to light up, so as not to annoy day visitors. Be considerate with the cooking and remember to take any mess home with you.  Some beaches allow cold ashes to be placed in a rubbish bag next to a bin, but please check with the council first.  Don\u0027t forget to take: The Halfords Briefcase BBQ , above, is the ideal companion for this trip and is currently half price at \u0026pound7.50. It folds up into a compact, convenient unit that will cook up more than enough food for a small family. Keep your sausages and pork pies beautifully cool in the Halfords 40 Litre Coolbox , at just \u0026pound85, was \u0026pound110 (save \u0026pound25).  Avoid: 10 \u0026amp 11 July, semi finals  If England reach this stage, the country will be officially consumed by football fever. Like the Welsh, Scotland\u0027s national football team also didn\u0027t qualify this year. Therefore it\u0027s quite likely that avoiding it will be a lot easier north of Hadrian’s Wall. It\u0027s hard to imagine a place more relaxing than the Scottish Highlands. The best thing to do is enjoy the sights and play some games. Go armed with a frisbee and bundles of energy and you’ll have an amazing time breathing in clean, football-free air.  From camping to log cabins, there\u0027s loads of places to stay and countless walks, bike rides and distillery tours (there are eight in the area) to take.

Punters posed for the cameras with ladies dressed in floral outfits and brightly coloured fascinators and gents sporting top hats and elegant suits. Many faced breathalyser tests and bag searches as organisers seek to clamp down on anti-social behaviour this year. Ascot management also scrapped the practice of roaming alcohol sellers in the stands and enlisted trained sniffer dogs to monitor attendees. There has also been a crackdown on beer sales and an increased stewarding presence. Organisers also installed ‘drug amnesty boxes’ for the safe disposal of illegal substances at the popular annual event which runs until Saturday. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex joined the Queen at the huge sporting event and presented the winning trophy for the 4.20pm race, the St James\u0027 Palace Stakes, to jockey Frankie Dettori after he galloped to glory on Without Parole.  Royal Ascot 2018 LIVE results: Prince Harry and Megan Markle visit plus news, tips, schedule and full racecard     The couple were seen holding hands in the winner\u0027s enclosure and Frankie kissed Meghan\u0027s hand as he accepted the trophy. The couple waved to the crowd as they were seen arriving on the royal carriage procession alongside Edward and Sophie, the Earl and Countess of Wessex. The Queen headed up the procession, standing out in a buttercup yellow coat dress, alongside daughter Princess Anne in blush pink. The Duchess wore a white Givenchy dress for her racing debut - Clare Waight Keller of the French fashion house designed her wedding gown - with a monochrome Philip Treacy hat.  They also joined the Queen, Prince Charles and Camilla and Princess Anne at the annual event - but Kate and Wills - who recently welcomed their third child - were absent. Ahead of the big race at 3.40pm racegoers poured into the venue dressed to the nines. Kelly Brooke was among the crowd, sporting a football themed hat from Ladbrokes to celebrate England’s football hopes.  The star of the bookmaker’s latest racing ad campaign, says: “I really want to show my support for the Three Lions and by wearing this gorgeous Ladbrokes hat designed by Ilda Di Vico, I think I have done just that.” The hat features a Bobby Moore figure holding aloft a Jules Rimet trophy and was designed by milliner Ilda Di Vico. Sir Cliff Richard was also seen among the celebrity stars at this year\u0027s racing spectacle - showing off in a grey suit and top hat. Among a host of other celebrities at the races were ex-WAG Lizzie Cundy, 48, who rocked a white feathered number and lace dress and former glamour model Jackie St Clair, 54, worked a floral theme.  Good Morning Britain\u0027s Kate Garraway rocked a fitted trouser suit, which she combined with a dramatic hat, while co-star Charlotte Hawkins won the fashion race in a 1950s-style green number, which was enhanced with a black, netted beret. Royal Ascot is renowned for its strict dress code and this year men must wear socks or risk being turned away from the famous race meet which is one of the highlights of the social calendar. With the UK having enjoyed good weather in the past few months the fashion for wearing shoes without socks may have crept into Royal Ascot.  This year\u0027s visitors sported an array of fashionable outfits - with ladies arriving in pastel pencil dress, brightly coloured stripy skirts and even a four of diamonds inspired dress. Rupert Adams from William Hill said: Ascot have tightened up the dress code for the royal meeting and many of the millennial generation might not even own socks. Punters traditionally have a bet on the colour of the Queen\u0027s hat and while the bookies thought she\u0027d opt for blue, she stood out in bright yellow with a blue flower.   Last year there was a massive gamble on the Queen wearing blue as she wore blue to the state opening of Parliament before travelling to Royal Ascot, but she changed into another coloured outfit for the race meet. The Queen spoke about her fondness for Royal Ascot in her foreword for the official programme: My family and I greatly look forward to Royal Ascot.  As the royal meeting has evolved in recent times, it remains one of Britain\u0027s finest sporting occasions with 300,000 racegoers enjoying the unique heritage of Royal Ascot every year, and many more people watching at home. Tradition and innovation sit comfortably together, over five days of racing. International competition is a compelling feature in the modern era, and it is always a delight to welcome horses and jockeys from around the world to this wonderful racecourse.

Donning flamboyant hats and high stilettos, race-goers were snapped sharing laughs, drinks and romantic moments. Some were spotted walking around barefoot and a few had a snooze in the grass. Others supped straight from the Champagne bottle as they toasted a very British day out.  Meghan Markle and Prince Harry were also at the famous venue to congratulate jockey Frankie Dettori after he won the St James\u0027s Palace Stakes.   The Duke of Sussex watched on as his new wife was pecked on the hand by Dettori, on the first of the five-day event this afternoon. The royal couple were presenting the jockey - who has been suspended after over-using his whip - with the glittering trophy following the 4.20pm race. The former actress and animal lover could be seen smiling and joking with the three-time British champion, before he lent in to plant a peck on her hand as they greeted one another. But husband Harry looked less than impressed, only finally cracking a smile after the winner let go of his wife\u0027s hand and lifted his prize.  The crowds of revellers also appeared to be having fun, with one woman appearing to have given up on her glass as she gripped a bottle of what looked like Champagne. Another lady was snapped appearing to help her friend out as she nearly fell over. Meanwhile, the excitement seemed to have got a bit too much for quite a few race-goers, who were pictured having a lie down on the grass.

Harvard researcher Matthew Sachs came to the conclusion after combining the results of his experiment with that of existing studies into the same subject. Sachs monitored the heart rates and skin conductance of subjects who listened to three of their favourite pieces of music. Intensity of lyrics, rising pitch, harmonic intervals and collective crowd singing emerged as the key factors in delivering the shivers.  Using the information Sachs created an equation: Pgoosebumps = CF (Sc + Id+Ap). CF recognises the cognitive factors and Sc is the social and environmental context such as the collective experience. Id stands for the individual differences such as the engagement with the music and Ap is the music’s acoustic properties, or the rapid increase or decrease in volume. Pgoosebumps is the percentage chance of getting goosebumps.  Sachs’ study was carried out to mark the launch of Barclaycard’s Entertainment partnership with Live Nation, which sees sponsorship of eight festivals across the summer and exclusive event perks for cardholders including 10 per cent back on festival pre-sales and many other benefits. Sachs said: Many studies have attempted to investigate what causes the emotion we feel while listening to music, but these have typically taken place in a lab setting. We’ve never before been able to explore how multiple factors influence the likelihood of experiencing goosebumps in a real-world context.  It’s hugely exciting to be able to explore the physiological correlates of aesthetic emotions for the first time during live performances this summer.” Barclaycard also carried out a survey to accompany the study. The results show seven in 10 Brits think goosebumps are a marker of great live entertainment, but only 16 per cent of us understand where the physiological phenomenon comes from. But the majority of Brits (71 per cent) think getting goosebumps is the top sign of a great live entertainment experience. It also emerged the emotional effect of a live music experience is also enhanced by being among friends (41 per cent), singing along with the crowd (41 per cent) and watching your favourite artist perform (40 per cent). The research also revealed while 71 per cent of Brits have experienced the chills during live entertainment, 13 per cent incorrectly believe that romantic attraction is actually the key cause of goosebumps – with almost one in 10 putting the sensation down to simply feeling cold (nine per cent).  Although 60 per cent of Brits associate goosebumps with the feeling of excitement, the new theory suggests that a personal relevance to the song, collective crowd experience and a rapid increase or decrease in volume are more important when it comes to delivering the shivers. Time of day is also a significant factor, with over half (56 per cent) of respondents feeling more goosebumps after 5pm than at any other time during a live music performance, with the optimum time for a goosebump moment identified as 6.37pm. Rock music was voted the genre most expected to cause goosebumps (31 per cent), followed by pop (29 per cent) and Indie (seven per cent). House tunes (six per cent) and classical symphonies (five per cent) complete the top five.  What’s more, Brits believe that watching their favourite band perform (28 per cent) is more likely to deliver the shivers than getting married (27 per cent), with only the sight of their new born child expected to create a greater goosebump-inducing moment (40 per cent). And it appears old flames burn the brightest for Brits, as over a tenth of respondents admit their most treasured memory of a great live music experience includes their ex or someone they used to date (11 per cent). Die-hard fans don’t need anyone by their side, with five per cent enjoying their best live music experience while on their own. Daniel Mathieson of Barclaycard, said: “Most people can identify with getting the chills while enjoying live entertainment, but very few actually understand the theory behind it. In just the first phase of our study, our goosebumps theory will finally provide some understanding of what causes the incredible phenomenon and makes live music so captivating.” "},{"url":null,"title":"worlds best home competition final","story":"NewsWorld\u0027s Best Home competition final shortlist includes breathtaking romantic Notting Hill townhouse and fairy tale French mansionThe top ten luxury homes, that are all up for sale, have been shortlisted as part of the HGTV Ultimate House Hunt in the Global Homes category\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAbigail O\u0027Leary13:18, 19 JUN 2018Updated14:25, 19 JUN 2018NewsThis Cape Town home in South Africa, with mountain views and its own koi ponds (Image: Caters News Agency)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThese are the stunning houses shortlisted for World\u0027s Best Home finals, including a romantic Notting Hill townhouse and fairy tale French mansion.

Michael Wright, 33, claims the man was hassling counter staff inside the shop - with his hand suspiciously inside a brown McDonald\u0027s carrier bag. The brave stay-at-home father peered inside the bag and said he saw the man\u0027s finger on the trigger of a loaded 9mm hand gun - nestled between a burger and chips. Fearing the man could whip out the gun at any minute, he quickly came up with a plan after talking with the cashier at the Circle K petrol station. Dad-of-four Michael, from Grovetown, Georgia, USA, started filming and calmly ushered the man outside while Circle K staff secretly phoned the police.  In the footage, Michael can be heard talking about having some french fries with the agitated man as he walked back and forth inside before allegedly dumping the bag of food - and gun - in a bin outside. Michael then pulled the bag out of the bin, showing a \u0027loaded gun with a full clip\u0027 of bullets fall out on to floor. Police swooped on the man after the incident at the store Grovetown, GA, at around 9:20pm on Saturday. Officers later confirmed a man had been charged with one count of carrying a concealed weapon and one possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.  Shaken Michael said: It could have easily turned out very differently and it goes to show that a calm approach is often better. I did think about wrestling the gun from the guy, but I\u0027m glad I didn\u0027t. Michael said: When I got to the counter the clerk softly stated he had a gun in the McDonald\u0027s bag. I quietly asked another guy there if we should act before he does anything. I whispered that I would grab the gun and he could help me take him down - but he basically left me to it and that\u0027s when I started to record. I was not going to leave him with the lady at the counter because I knew he was just waiting for me to leave.

Terrified kids are heard sobbing “Mami” and “Papa” in the eight-minute clip before an agent says: “Well, we have an orchestra here. “What’s missing is a conductor.” And a six-year-old girl from El Salvador begs a guard to let her call an aunt amid the chaos caused by Donald Trump’s zero tolerance policy on illegal immigrants.  Through her tears she pleads: “My mommy says that I’ll go with my aunt and she’ll come to pick me up there as quickly aspossible.” The children are among thousands separated from their parents in Texas after being held trying to enter the US from Mexico.  Trump has tried to blame the Democrats for the cruel situation, claiming his rivals refuse to work with him to revise immigration laws. But the separations are due to his policy.  There is no law stating children should be taken from parents, even if entering illegally.

Sasikumar Vasan, from the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, was enjoying a calm evening with his two friends, a man and woman, on the popular Sinquerim beach in Goa - a major tourist destination for beach lovers worldwide. The trio were sitting near a rocky stretch adjoining a creek which empties into the sea taking selfies when suddenly they were hit by a strong wave. While the waves pushed the other tourists further onto the bowl of the rocks, Sasikumar was swept away into the water.  Heartbreaking video recorded by other tourists show the moment his friends are pushed into the rocks while Sasikumar is taken by the strong waves. The friends, yet to be identified, somehow get back on their feet and carefully climb to safety, not realising Sasikumar is not following them. After somebody alerts them, the man looks behind to realise Sasikumar has been swept away. The two stand shell-shocked for almost 20 seconds, frantically looking at the sea to spot him before realising he is gone.  Police inspector Jivba Dalvi said: Two of the three tourists managed to come out but their friend was swept away by the strong waves. The victim\u0027s dead body was fished out later. In a similar incident which also occurred near a rocky outcrop at Baga beach, located in North Goa, a strong wave pulled Dinesh Kumar Ranganatha, 28, also a native of Tamil Nadu, into the sea, resulting in his drowning on the same day. Dinesh\u0027s body was fished out from the sea almost an hour after the tragic incident happened.

He was Andrew Buttar, president of the Dundee Charity Football Association and, importantly, an official of one of the clubs already on the go in the city – Our Boys.Buttar felt that by joining forces with one of their big local rivals, East End, a new club representing the city as a whole would be capable of doing it proud at national league level.Perhaps surprisingly given the strong tribal nature of football even at that time and the fact an earlier attempt at amalgamation was thrown out by members of the clubs, within a month of him publicly airing the idea they’d met and put together an application for Scottish League membership.So it was that on June 12, 1893, at their AGM, the new Dundee Football and Athletic Club was admitted to the league.In doing so they beat off competition from Cowlairs and, more notably an Edinburgh-based outfit going by the name of Hibernian – whatever happened to them?With just two months to the start of the new season, there was plenty work to be done and, less than two weeks after the league vote, a committee, of which Buttar was vice-president, had been formed to run things.A home for the team had also to be found and, when hopes of playing at Carolina Port were dashed by another local side, Strathmore, obtaining the lease for it, Our Boys’ home at West Craigie Park, a ground that lay roughly between Albert Street and Morgan Street, was earmarked.Work to get it ready for the national league was hastily arranged and carried out. At the same time the committee set about putting together a team capable of competing at a higher level. For the most part that involved picking the best performers from East End and Our Boys, though Scotland cap Sandy Keillor and a team-mate from Montrose, goalie Billy McKie, were also brought in.So it was that, on August 12, barely three months on from the bid to form the club had gained real momentum, Dundee ran out to face Rangers at West Craigie Park on the first day of the new Scottish League season.The Gers were already a well- established league outfit and had secured their first title just two years earlier, so for Dundee to come from two goals down to earn their first league point from a 3-3 draw was a creditable performance.On top of the result, further vindication of the decision to move to the big stage came in the shape of a healthy 5,000 turnout for the game.After a-not-unexpected defeat at eventual champions Celtic the following week, a first win came in the second home game at the end of August when Renton were edged out 3-2.The 18-game campaign would yield a further five wins and two draws for an eighth-place finish and, although that meant they had to apply for re-election, the bid was successful. That first season also saw the team switch to first choice home Carolina Port, the ground many fans still believe was their original home.And if that first campaign couldn’t quite be described as auspicious, it was a start and the beginning of an eventful next 125 years.n Tomorrow – The Managers.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/keepers-collage-300x180.jpg ","title":"csaba laszlo delighted as dundee united move to fix up giant goalkeepers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United have filled the void in the first line of their defence by fixing up two giant goalies from European football.With Harry Lewis back at Southampton after his year-long loan and Deniz Mehmet out for six months with a knee injury, it was no secret the Tangerines were in the market for goalkeepers.Now they’ve moved for Swiss goalie Benjamin Siegrist and Slovakian keeper Matej Rakovan.

It’s a phrase to alert the teachers.”The father-of-two believes the needles fell out of wheelie bin which was lying on its side next to the paraphernalia.He spoke to his children, daughter Kiyann, 12, and Kelvin, to warn them about the needles and waited for council staff to come and safely dispose of them.Graeme, who works for Scotmid, said: “I think one of the bins had blown over, and there were about 30-odd needles lying on the ground. Children were coming out of school around 4pm, and there are three schools near here so a few kids walk past.\u0026#8220I waited and told any children coming past to go on to the pavement on the other side, as the needles were also on the road itself.”Gregor Murray, the council’s education convener, said: “The children were involved in an environmental project to clean-up the area around the school.“The ‘cookies and cream’ phrase was something they were told to shout out if they found anything like needles, broken glass or other hazardous things. I welcome anything like this schools are doing to make the children safe.”David Baxter, Dundee branch secretary of teaching union the Education Institute of Scotland, welcomed the procedure, saying: “The teachers’ objective is to keep children safe and I think, in Dundee, they do a really good job of that. It seems a very sensible thing that a teacher has done.”A council spokesman warned the public not to lift a discarded needle themselves, and a 24-hour response line could be called to remove the potential danger, on 01382 433063.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united agree deal for austrian defender","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United have agreed a deal to sign midfielder Christoph Rabitsch, according to reports in Austria.The 22-year-old Austria is said to have signed a two-year-deal at Tannadice after leaving Wolfsberger in the country\u0026#8217s Bundesliga.Rabitsch will be Csaba Laszlo\u0026#8217s seventh summer signing as United look to get back to the Scottish Premiership at the third time of asking.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united linked with audacious move for aberdeen striker rooney","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United have been linked with an audacious move for Aberdeen striker Adam Rooney.The 30-year-old, who has scored 85 goals in the Scottish top-flight for Inverness and Aberdeen, was out of favour last season at Pittodrie and the Tangerines are reportedly eyeing up a sensational move to bring him to Tannadice.United boss Csaba Laszlo is on the lookout for a targetman to complement the signing of striker Nicky Clark as he aims to build a side capable of winning the Championship next campaign.Whether Rooney would be willing to drop to the second tier when other Premiership clubs would surely be interested remains to be seen.Should Dons boss Derek McInnes make him available for transfer, the queue to snap up the goalscoring Irishman would be a long one.Last season, Rooney made 27 appearances, scoring nine goals, though many of his run-outs were from the bench.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ex dundee defender jon aurtenetxe linked with move to leeds united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee full-back Jon Aurtenetxe has been linked with a surprise move to Championship side Leeds United.The troubled English giants recently appointed former Chile and Argentina coach Marcelo Bielsa as their new manager.The 26-year-old left-back enjoyed the best spell of his career under the enigmatic Argentine, known as ‘the Madman’, at Athletic Bilbao, reaching the final of the Europa League in 2012.Aurtenetxe left Dundee after a season at Dens Park.

last season to top the table but fell well short of champions St Mirren.This time around, it promises to be even more difficult with two teams coming down from the Premiership.Starting with those two,

Ferguson are determined to make their first chance in management a success.County will be a tough nut to crack for most teams in the Championship.Inverness CTCaley Thistle were expected to be Dundee United’s main challengers last season but got off to an awful start.Boss John Robertson turned things around and a late surge almost saw them into the play-offs.Expect that good form to continue in the new campaign.DunfermlineAllan Johnston’s 2017/18 team has been ripped apart with players leaving left, right and centre.With a lot of work to be done in the transfer market at the moment, another finish in the play-offs looks unlikely but Johnston has a history of getting his sides into the top four.FalkirkFormer Dundee manager Paul Hartley is slowly making the Bairns side his own after big

He played 11 times for Poland while Czachowski picked up 45 caps.The ‘Mad Monk’ Grzegorz Szamotulski, Lukasz Zaluska and Rado Cierzniak were all top goalies at Tannadice while Jaroslaw Fojut had a decent spell in 2014-15. They have 15 caps between them.SenegalJust their second appearance at a finals since they exploded on to the scene in 2002 by beating world champions France in the opener in South Korea.The West Africans would love to repeat their run to the last eight then and will fancy their chances of getting out of this group.Star player: Sadio Mane.Local link: French-born Morgaro Gomis played more than 200 games for Dundee United over two spells.Now 32, Gomis plays in Malaysia but picked up two international caps with Senegal in 2009 while at Tannadice.Yet again Scotland won’t be there but, with just one sleep until the big kick-off, all eyes are now firmly fixed on the World Cup in Russia.The action starts tomorrow when the hosts take on Saudi Arabia in Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium.Tonight the Tele’s build up concludes with our lowdown on the final section, Group H, possibly the least fashionable of all the groups, hipsters apart.Trying not to leave you feeling too left out by the Tartan Army’s absence, we’ll also provide a local link, tenuous or otherwise, to each participating nation.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7934519.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Singer Annie Lennox  sad and disappointed  after second Art School blaze","story":"                          SCOTS singing legend\u0026nbspAnnie Lennox said she was,\u0026nbsp\"sad and disappointed\" after Glasgow School of Art suffered its second major fire in four years."},{"url":null,"title":"Charred-out ruins  shattered glass and a devastated O2 ABC  What   s left of the Glasgow School of Art","story":"                          FIREFIGHTERS surveyed\u0026nbspthe scale of the damage to the world-renowned Glasgow School of Art three days after it was devastated by a massive blaze."},{"url":null,"title":"First look    6 43m homes project finally unveiled in Glasgow   s East End","story":"                          GLASGOW\u0026rsquoS East End has received a multi-million pound boost as families start to move into a new housing project."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7942034.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Ex Scots TV presenter on trial accused of putting hand down woman s trousers and touching her bottom","story":"                          A WOMAN has told a court she has nothing to gain from accusing former TV presenter John Leslie of sexual assault."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7942329.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Baby joy for Celtic couple as news revealed on social media","story":"                          CELTIC star Nir Bitton and his wife have revealed they are expecting their second child."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/6970465.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Ed Sheeran donates belongings to charity shop -

That will be the case here and it\u0027 important that there\u0027 a sense of ownership of citizens in the city.\"He said the aim of the group, which had met 14 times over the last three-and-a-half years, was to create an international-class attraction which drew people to Inverness rather than being something people simply saw when in the Highland capital.LDN Architects will look at the Bridge Street site to help create a masterplan by autumn prior to public consultation. A Highland Council spokeswoman said the local authority would become the landlord of any occupants or tenants.\"There will be no changes to the buildings until consultation has taken place, apart from any minor repairs which a landlord would be responsible for,\" she said.Tuesday 19 Jun 2018 9:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116213.jpg","title":"Chelsie is delighted with her pageant debut","story":"\u0026nbspMISS Scotland finalist Chelsie Allison says she remains proud of her achievement, despite being pipped to the title at the final hurdle.The social work student, from Kirkhill, finished just a point behind winner Linzi McClelland at Friday\u0027 showpiece event.Chelsie (20), who was taking part in her first-ever pageant, said she loved the experience and now has her sights set on returning for another shot at the crown.\"I am very proud of how well I did,\" she said.\"There was only one point between myself and Linzi so that was quite frustrating, just because it was so close.\"I didn\u0026rsquot even think I would get as far as I did.\"It was the first pageant-type event I had ever done and I really enjoyed it.\"I thought it would be quite stressful but it wasn\u0026rsquot at all like that.\"You don\u0026rsquot really have any time to think about that, which is probably a good thing.\"As soon as the show started it was just go, go, go.\"The organisers have already asked me to go back again in the future and that\u0027 something I\u0026rsquod be really keen to do.\"The top three girls get to go for a photoshoot with some of the sponsors.

GREATER sense of empowerment for residents of one of the Highlands\u0026rsquo most deprived communities is being promised as part of a new plan for the area.The South Kessock and Merkinch locality plan, launched this week, details measures to boost quality of life there.Drawn up by the Inverness Community Partnership (ICP) \u0026ndash a body bringing together representatives of a range of bodies including Highland Council, police and NHS Highland \u0026ndash it includes proposals to improve support for school leavers and provision for unemployed people looking to move into work, as well as plans for a new family science event and a community clean-up.As part of moves to develop \"stronger connections for local voices\", as well as improving participation by young people and schools in community planning, there are also proposals for a new focus group drawn from local residents to support the ICP\u0027 work.This is off the back of evidence that residents have \"little confidence that their voices are heard\".Marked by lower than average incomes and a lack of qualifications in young people leaving school, in 2016 the average life expectancy in Merkinch was just 66 years \u0026ndash compared to 82 in the affluent Crown area, barely a mile away.The report stated: \"Community partners recognise that, in order for health and wellbeing interventions to be effective, they need to be delivered in the local community in partnership with existing community projects and activities.\"We recognise that our best chance of achieving success is to put people and communities at the centre of our planning and delivery processes.\"We will work with the people to tackle what matters most to them and will make a positive difference to their lives and to the community.\"Notwithstanding this, it also means that we recognise that communities can and do achieve great things for themselves.\"We need to harness such achievements and increase the level of influence and sense of control that people have over decisions and services across the locality.\"The plan also raises the possibility of support for residents to take direct control of a range of community assets.Council city centre manager David Haas said: \"We have talked to all the local communities to find out what people want to see improved and help the great work that\u0027 already being done in these areas by existing groups.\"We want to give them the encouragement to do more.\"It\u0027 down to us to listen to what people want and give them a helping hand to create the community they want.\"Dell McClurg, chairwoman of Merkinch Community Council, said it was ironic that it was apparently not told of the launch event \"until it had already started\" but agreed: \"There needs to be more help for the people who are already working at the coal-face in the area.\"She said: \"It\u0027 important that the people who live and work here are listened to.\"We live here and we know what works in this area.\"We just need the right level of support.\"Highland councillor Bet McAllister (Inverness Central) said: \"Things are really moving forward in the area and people seem happy with where we are going.\"As councillors, we need to be out there speaking to the community, and letting people know that they can come to us.\"Many strands of the plan are due to get under way imminently, with moves to review current provision for unemployed people set to start in August. The findings will be used to determine future actions.Longer term plans for a \"bespoke early leavers programme\", which includes ensuring all early school leavers have an individual work coach, are set to be in place by July next year.Tuesday 19 Jun 2018 9:36 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04111000/04111983.jpg","title":"New school campus is given the green light","story":"AMBITIOUS plans to create a badly-needed new school campus in a growing Inverness neighbourhood have been given the green light to the delight of community leaders.Highland councillors approved proposals to transform the existing Merkinch Primary School and nursery into a facility fit for the 21st century including all-weather sports pitches which will be available to the local community.It will also incorporate the Merkinch Family Centre which will relocate from its base in Coronation Park.The school is presently housed in cramped accommodation in a 132-year-old category B-listed building with extensions plus portable classrooms in the playground.Under the plans, which are broadly supported by the community, a new two-storey extension in a contemporary design will be built to accommodate the primary school and nursery.There will also be an adjoining single-storey double height sports block, play areas, informal/social courtyard spaces and garden areas.The relocated family centre, school dining hall and community sports studios will be housed in the original school building which will be refurbished while previous extensions will be demolished.Inverness Central councillor Richard Laird outlined the challenges of the development site when he spoke at the council\u0027s south planning applications committee meeting on Tuesday.\"To describe this as simply expanding a new school understates what the council is seeking to do,\" he said.The SNP representative said the integrated campus would provide services from the very early years right through primary school.Cllr Laird felt the designs addressed a range of existing issues including the grassed playing area which he described as an \"unusable bog\" at certain times of the year plus road safety concerns over traffic on Telford Road where the present school entrance is located.He also felt the location of the proposed two-storey extension in the centre of the site presented no risk of overshadowing Carse Road.\"I think what we have is a very elegant solution to a number of challenges,\" he said.\"This is a project which has almost unanimous support in the Merkinch community.\"Speaking after the meeting, fellow ward councillor Bet McAllister was \"over the moon\" the plans had been given the go ahead.\"It will make a huge difference to the community,\" the Labour representative said.\"It is a lovely school. Unfortunately, it is very small and it gets very over-crowded.\"The children and teachers deserve a place to meet modern-day learning needs while the outdoor facilities will benefit the whole community.\"I think everyone will be delighted.\"Dell McClurg, chairman of Merkinch Community Council, also welcomed the news but had reservations over the loss of some open space which will be replaced with all-weather pitches.\"We need a new school but I think there should be an ad hoc area for children to go and play and kick a football about for half-an-hour,\" she said.\"They don\u0027t always want organised football matches.\"David Paulin, Active Merkinch manager, said informal green spaces would still exist while more sporting activities could be available.\"This creates separate play areas from casual use areas which can end up covered in dog mess and covered in rubbish,\" he said.Tuesday 19 Jun 2018 9:36

That’s why it’s so important that we ensure they understand the strength of feeling in Aberdeen.”The protest will start at 6.30pm, at the Queen’s Road entrance to Rubislaw Quarry.A decision will be made on Thursday at 10am in the Town House.A Carttera spokeswoman previously said the new development would “breathe life” into the area.She said: “Aberdeen is currently at a crossroads with oil investment but with the new football stadium, AWPR, Nigg Harbour, the Music Hall refurbishment, Art Gallery extension and new AECC, the city is already taking bold steps to invest for future generations.“Approval of this development would be another significant and complementary contribution towards that.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/35721710_958182864386268_4797971862590062592_o-851x564.jpg ","title":"images show behind the scenes at aberdeen air traffic control","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew images taken by staff at Aberdeen\u0026#8217s air traffic control have been shared online.The series of pictures shared by the National Air Traffic Services (NATS) on Facebook give a rare glimpse at the technology required to monitor all planes and helicopters flying in the north-east.Inside the tower, two images show the banks of screens and desks air traffic controllers would use to monitor the region\u0026#8217s airspace.Other images show helicopters parked up outside at the airport.And a final image shows the view from the top of the control tower over Aberdeen\u0026#8217s airfield late at night.The images were shared on Facebook as part of NATS #TowerTuesday project.(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]  if (d.getElementById(id)) return  js = d.createElement(s) js.id = id  js.src = \u0027https://connect.facebook.net/en_GB/sdk.js#xfbml=1\u0026version=v3.0\u0027  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs)}(document, \u0027script\u0027, \u0027facebook-jssdk\u0027))Here are some amazing shots taken from our NATS employees in Aberdeen #TowerTuesday ✈️Posted by NATS on\u0026nbspTuesday, 19 June 2018\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"photographer uses 113 year old camera to capture poignant images of north east lifeboat crews","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA photographer aiming to create an archive gallery of every lifeboat station in the UK has made his way to the north-east.Jack Lowe\u0026#8217s Lifeboat Station Project is an attempt to photograph all of the 238 lifeboat stations in Britain.Last week he made his way to the north-east, visiting Macduff, Fraserburgh and Buckie.As well as using modern cameras, Jack has also been photographing each location using an 113-year-old camera.The vintage camera uses glass plates, rather than film, to keep the image.The glass plate is then processed \u0026#8211 with the result shown below.Describing the image, photographer Jack Lowe said: \u0026#8220Certainly one of the most poignant crew photographs I’ve made so far — the RNLI Fraserburgh volunteers on Thursday with their statue, a memorial to the three major disasters suffered at this lifeboat station.\u0026#8221The same process was used to capture this image of the Macduff lifeboat crew unloading their boat from the back of a flatbed truck.Jack has been travelling across the UK in a refurbished ambulance \u0026#8211 which also doubles as his dark room \u0026#8211 with the aim of photographing every lifeboat station in the country.Fraserburgh was his 106th lifeboat station.He said: “For a trip like this to work, I think you need a map, a story and an interesting vehicle – I purchased my ambulance on eBay after another buyer fell through.“I have had a passion for photography and lifeboats since I was eight-years-old and, after wanting a mid-life change in direction, I came up with the idea to photograph all of the 238 stations.“The Lifeboat Station Project is one of the largest of its kind and I hope to do a full exhibition of all the images once it’s complete.”\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"meek cards albatross to move into the hunt at royal aberdeen","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMost of us could not dream of hitting two irons to a par five green – but Canadian Sam Meek’s second shot on the sixth at Royal Aberdeen found the cup.The University of Nevada student’s albatross was the talk of the historic city course, which is main host of this week’s Amateur Championship.Meek teed off on the 487-yard hole with a four iron and only knew something special had happened with his 240-yard five-iron approach when spectators around the green started shouting and clapping.Meek, 19, eventually finished with a two-under 69, leaving him right in the thick of things.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade.

This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity.

These had a variety of riding and control of paces challenges including an unusual off piste element using the quarry area of the field.Judge Debbie Hay Thorburn was very impressed with the independent riding of the youngest members who tackled all the tasks with confidence and determination. The show jumping catered for all ages and abilities and there were exciting jump-offs to entertain spectators. In fact many of the passing ferry passengers stopped to watch from the road.The new timing equipment, purchased with aid of a grant from Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust, was in full use by judge Mairi Henderson and made for more professional accuracy in timing aspects.The final Grand Prix had only two competitors but it was a masterclass of style and competence from Jojo and Katie which made it a joy to watch.As usual the event ended with some fast and exciting games and after the field was cleared there was the prizegiving in the Pony Club’s brand new blue tent.The Junior Trophy for the day was won by Louise Ralston from Campbeltown and Iris McMillan from Tayvallich took the Senior Trophy for a second year while the non-members trophy was won by Andrea McShannon.Pony Club PonyClass 11 Frazer Prentice, Firefly2 Louise Ralston, Nero3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceClass 21 Willow Ryan, Ryan2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, ColeyClass 31 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Katie MacKay, Eva3 Josephine Boase, ValerieClass 41 Andrea McShannon, Nicole2 Julie McLeish, Eclipse3 Shelagh Oakes, Pery4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyShow JumpingStars of the Future \u0026#8211 Lead Rein1 Louise Ralston, Nero2 Frazer Prentice, Firefly3 Rory Shaw, Libby4 Jake Rowan, AliceStars of the Future1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Zoe Prentice, Cowal3 Isla McShannon, Coley4 Willow Ryan, RyanNewcomers1 Iris McMillan, Conker2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Michelle McAloon, Eclipse4 Catriona Ryan, DoneyDiscovery1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Andrea McShannon, Nicole3 Katie MacKay, Eva4 Michelle McAloon, EclipseGrand Prix1 Josephine Boase, Valerie2 Katie MacKay, Eva\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 07/06/18, 4:46 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.This week\u0026#8217s photograph comes from Jacqui Barker of Tarbert.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

They won a throw-in deep in the Glasgow Red Star half, taken by Craig Aitken. After playing a neat one-two with Woody Hoad, Craig sent in a teasing cross for Keiran Caskie to glance past the Glasgow Red Star keeper.Lochgilphead introduced Jamie Stewart and Ciaran Gibson who helped freshen things up and work hard to close the game out.Special mention to subs Lee Harris, just returning from injury, and the ever reliable Calum Paterson.At the end of the game the Lochgilphead boys were presented with the League Cup and also the League Championship for 2004 age group teams to make it a double celebration.With three games still left to play the boys are looking to make it through the season with only one league defeat.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

Both professional and amateur artists in the area are encouraged to make use of the exhibition to display their work.The overriding aim of the exhibition, since its beginning in 1967, has always been to foster interest in locally-produced art and to give people from the community the opportunity to let others see, appreciate, and maybe buy their works.Organisers wish to thank the Army Cadet Force for permission to use their building.Details about how to enter exhibits will appear in adverts in the Argyllshire Advertiser, Facebook and on the exhibition website.

Along the way she meets a gruff innkeeper played by The Late Late Show host Craig Ferguson, who could offer another chance for love.Locals to Argyll will spot The George Hotel as Lord Howard Awd’s (played by Craig Ferguson) Inn that Annabelle takes refuge in when she falls for the Scottish landscape. They may also spot Lochgilphead’s Argyll Street, which was packed with trucks on Wednesday June 13 for filming, and Icon Hairdressing which was the setting for another scene.To get into the mood for the movie, listen to Kathie Lee Gifford’s single \u0026#8216Love Me To Death\u0026#8217 which is now available on iTunes.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters week 24","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 16/06/18, 5:23 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe Now[Usual Science Matters logo]The battle for survival between native red and invasive grey squirrels has been ongoing in the UK ever since our ancestors introduced the grey species from North America in 1870s.With the species competing for resources and the greys carrying squirrel-pox virus, which is harmless to them but lethal to reds, the contest seemed to be tipped in the greys\u0026#8217 favour.But in nature such rivalry is likely to be influenced by more complex interactive networks than just two species. Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"working to preserve the yarns of yesteryear","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/06/18, 6:00 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowPeople across Argyll and Bute are being encouraged to take part in a unique project that will help to preserve tales about the area for future generations.Argyll and Bute Youth Services is calling on people of all ages to help gather stories, film clips, photographs and objects about the area to celebrate the uniqueness of Argyll and Bute.The Digital Storytelling Project is part of the national Year of Young People and aims to bring together our younger and older generations to share their stories and folklore tales of yesteryear.Argyll and Bute Council’s policy lead for education, Councillor Yvonne McNeilly said: \u0026#8216This is not only a great way of capturing precious stories about the area, but it’s an excellent opportunity for a mix of generations to work together.\u0026#8216Argyll is teeming with folklore tales, from giant serpents and mermaids being spotted on our coastlines in years gone by, to stories of haunted caves and bloody battles \u0026#8211 we’ve got a lot to talk about.\u0026#8216The Year of Young People is all about bringing generations together and celebrating our young people.

South Ayrshire councillors will launch a bid to scrap their own controversial rule, the Post can reveal. We told last week how the three-year-old policy is being labelled a threat to small businesses. Now councillors are ready to intervene in the row. Labour’s Phil Saxton, who represents Troon, is to table a motion before colleagues calling for a rethink.  He said: “The word we’re looking for here is compromise. “I don’t think the relevant detail was considered when this policy was first introduced. “The ability to enforce something like this will always be very difficult.” Cllr Saxton is now expected to lead calls for a ‘mixed’ smoking zone outside cafes or bars which use council-owned pavements. He said: “We could look at 50 per cent of the tables smoking and 50 per cent not. “I don’t think that’s an unreasonable solution. “Right now I’m looking at gathering support and hopefully the vote will go our way.”  That vote is scheduled to take place on June 28 when the council holds its last full meeting before the summer recess. It’s understood members are currently divided on the issue, which was introduced under the council’s last administration. The new move comes as the Post reported last week how furious cafe bosses said their business was under threat because of the “crazy”council law. Nino and Karen Pajovic insisted a smoking ban outside their Cafe Le Monde premises in Ayr was costing them thousands Said Nino: “A compromise along these lines would be perfect and is surely the common sense approach.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"brave mum set skydive charity","story":"NewsBrave mum set to skydive for charity for inspirational nephewJoanne Dunlop, of Ayr, will jump from a hair-raising 10,000ft at Skydive St Andrews.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet10:32, 15 JUN 2018NewsMegan Mcphearson and Joanne Dunlop\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA brave mum is set to take to the skies for her inspirational nephew.

Villagers - and residents across the greenbelt in Muirhead - mounted a stiff rearguard action after a bid to get it zoned for housing. For the first time it emerged a developer WAS behind the plan, rather than, as was insisted, South Ayrshire Council officers just selected it as a prospect. Senior SNP councillor Craig Mackay said on Tuesday it was now “highly unlikely” it would make the next stage. And he told Troon Community Council : “No decisions have been made and we are not out of the woods yet with the Muirhead-Loans site yet. “But on the basis the available land pretty much matches what we need for new housing over the next five years, there should be no need for any release of greenbelt sites. “It is highly unlikely it will be built on.” We revealed the secret plan for the soggy 30 acre field in October, which would link the medieval clachan to the town of Troon. It sparked an emergency meeting of Loans Community Council and the public packed out Troon Community Council meetings.  And at the time town councillor Peter Convery said: “That ground is sacrosanct and it should never have been suggested for the local plan.” Planners were promoting the sight, saying the “layouts of both settlements turn their backs twoards each other at the moment and this doesnt create an attractive approach to either of them.” Councillor Mackay said the house sites currently available “pretty much” matched the demand. And he revealed South Ayrshire Council has now taking a slightly different approach from the developer-led schemes. He added: “Brownfield land will be prioritised even though that is not as lucrative for developers.” Councillor Mackay also revealed a developer had been circling on the Loans site - despite insistence from council officers there was no developer. He said:”Planning officers gave assurances there was no developer.. but there was.”  The breakthrough has been hailed by David Chalmers, chairman of Loans Community Council. He said: “It is obviously encouraging hearing Councillor McKay’s statement that development be allowed on the greenbelt between Loans and Muirhead is unlikely to be adopted in LDP2. “We will, of course, anxiously await SAC’s verification of this which we understand will not be until nearer the end of this year. “Every praise should be given to the overwhelming response given by the residents of Loans and Muirhead - a 367 signature petition and 246 letters - which clearly demonstrated the level of feeling against.” South Ayrshire Council said the process to publish the new Development Plan was still active. A spokesman said: “There are a range of issues that are suggested, discussed and determined. This is a very thorough process to ensure that all stakeholders are given due consideration. As a result, we’ll only be able to give assurance of what is included in, or excluded from the proposed plan when a report is considered by the Council later this year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12699200.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/JS153590781.jpg","title":"new arrivals bring light parents","story":"NewsNew arrivals bring a light to parents\u0027 livesWe wish all the best to the new happy families, and any other recent newborns.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet16:42, 13 JUN 2018NewsNew arrivals\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA number of new arrivals have been welcomed to Ayrshire.

And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Mum and baby left shaken after crossing near miss in Selkirk","story":"POLICE are trying to track down a driver who narrowly missed hitting a mum and her baby on a pedestrian crossing in Selkirk.\nThe woman was carrying her 12-week-old son when the driver of a 4x4 vehicle ignored a red light.\nAlthough both the 35-year-old woman and her child escaped unhurt, officers want to trace the near-miss driver.\nConstable Lesley Shiell told the Border : \"Fortunately, no one was injured during this incident, but it left the mother quite shaken, as the car passed relatively close to where she was crossing with her son.\n\"The driver\u0027s failure to observe the red light could have resulted in a very serious collision and we are treating this matter very seriously.\"\nThe incident happened around 11.15am last Thursday (June 7) on the High Street.\nThe mother and her baby were using the pedestrian crossing outside the County Hotel.\nPolice believe the driver of the old-style 4x4, who was heading north towards Galashiels, is around 30 to 40 years old.\nPC Shiell added: \"Anyone who was on Selkirk High Street on Thursday morning and witnessed what happened, or who can help us identify the male driving the 4x4 car is urged to contact police immediately.\"\nAnyone with information can contact Selkirk Police Station via 101 and quote incident number 1327 of the 7th June.\nAlternatively, an anonymous report can be made to the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Innerleithen Principals revealed for St Ronan   s Games week 2018","story":"INNERLEITHEN has announced its Principals for this year\u0026rsquos St Ronan\u0026rsquos Border Games and Cleikum Ceremonies.\nHamish Easton, a P7 pupil at St Ronan\u0026rsquos Primary School, was unveiled as the school\u0026rsquos Dux Boy last Friday and will represent Saint Ronan in Innerleithen\u0026rsquos Cleikum Ceremonies during Games Week.\nThe youngster, who lives in the town\u0026rsquos High Street, will have many duties to perform during the celebrations.\nAnd he was delighted to have been chosen.\nHamish said: \u0026ldquoI was very proud and pleased because it is a great opportunity to represent the school and town.\nMeanwhile, Clara Pirie, also in Primary 7, was selected as Dux Girl and will play a leading role in the ceremonies and throughout the week.\nClara, who lives at Kirklands with her family, told us: \u0026ldquoI have always admired the Dux Girls and longed to become one.\n\u0026ldquoWhen Mr Belleville read out my name it was like a dream come true.\nJoining the Duxes as representatives of the school at Games Week this year will be Lantern Bearer Harry Campbell (Primary 2) as well as Monks and Sash Girls from primary three upwards...\nP3 \u0026ndash Sash Girls: Sophie Cotter and Katie Rendle\nMonks: Kian Lynas and Owen Thomas\nP4 \u0026ndash Sash Girls: Elly Baker and Erin Glendinning\nMonks: Angus Henderson and Jack McGinn\nP5 \u0026ndash Sash Girls: Murron Coltman and Carys Leslie\nMonks: Robbie Jackson and Sonny Turner\nP6 \u0026ndash Sash Girls: Sarah Whiteford and Freya Wilson\nMonks: Calum Bauld and James Belleville\nP7 \u0026ndash Sash Girls: Sasha Lamb and Ava Thomson\nMonks: Ally Birks and Billy Birks\nThe announcements were made by headteacher Keith Belleville at a special assembly which was attended by Standard Bearer Elect Jamie Boyd, his Lass Rosie Graham along with their supporters, Principal Guest Craig Glendinning and Games Committee officials, headed by chairman Alan Patterson.\nFollowing the ceremony, every pupil in school was treated to a barbecue and Caldwell\u0026rsquos ice cream.

Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest.\nOn Friday morning the 26-year-old joiner led his town with both authority and calmness as Souters celebrated and honoured their historic traditions.\nYet the countdown couldn\u0027t have been more nerve-racking or distracting.\nDelays in Selkirk town centre renovations meant a reshuffle of vantage points for the iconic Casting of the Colours ceremony.\nAnd on the eve of the Common Riding itself, Storm Hector rampaged through the Royal Burgh tearing down bunting and leaving a trail of destruction and debris.\nIf the build-up wasn\u0027t distracting enough, a thoughtless thug spent the Nicht Afore the Morn spray-painting graffiti on landmarks including the War Memorial.\nBut just a few hours later the 2018 Standard Bearer remained the picture of calm as the sun gently rose on Friday morning.\nThe weather had relented, the debris had been cleared, the bunting had been restrung, and the vandalism was covered.\nAnd as Souters frae a\u0027 the airts linked arms and belted out the songs they\u0027d learned as children, all the woes were soon forgotten.\nSelkirk shone as it always does on Common Riding morning.\nAfter returning the Burgh Flag, Standard Bearer Forrest told us: \"I have been calm all week and even managed to get a good three hours\u0027 sleep last night.\n\"I\u0027m not sure how I manage it, but I don\u0027t get nervous at all, and despite everything that has happened, for me the Common Riding couldn\u0027t have gone any better.\n\"I\u0027ve loved the build up and I have loved every second of being Standard Bearer - I don\u0027t think the smile has left my face since the minute I got up this morning.\"\nWhether it was the four years he served as an Attendant - behind James Cheyne in 2009, Douglas Gunn in 2010, Gavin Henderson in 2012 and Kieran Riddle in 2017 -

Standard Bearer Forrest.\nThe Flute Band\u0027s Rouse Parade set the tone for a day few will forget.\nHundreds gathered at the War Memorial to honour the brave sons of Selkirk who didn\u0027t come home.\nAnd as the First Drum was sounded at 6am in the Market Place, the hundreds who do come home year after year from far off lands burst into song.\nHer Bright Smile has rarely sounded so good.\nThe build-up had well and truly begun.\nAnd by the time Standard Bearer Forrest was officially installed by Lady Busser, Dylis Wheelans, on the balcony of the Victoria Hall the hundreds had grown to thousands.\nA total of 281 riders followed the 2018 Standard Bearer doon the Green, across the Ettrick and up the Linglie.\nEveryone one of them was safe oot and every one of them returned safe in, some two-and-a-half hours later.\nOfficial reports later confirmed only three minor falls occurred throughout the entire procession.\nAs Standard Bearer Forrest, duly assisted by his Attendants Craig Monks, Robbie Reilly, Thomas Willmott and Liam Cassidy, led the cavalcade beyond Tibbie\u0027s towards the Three Brethren, beneath in the ancient streets of Selkirk the Hammermen, the Weavers, the Fleshers, the Colonials, the Merchants and the Ex-Soldiers began to muster ahead of their march to the Toll.\nAll the pomp and ceremony, headed by the trusty Silver and Pipe bands, brings out the best in this small rural burgh.\nIt\u0027s a place where pride and passion go hand in hand with smiles and laughter.\nSongs are sung, friendships rekindled and customs observed as the crowds patiently await the Coming in of the Burley.\nAnd they didn\u0027t have to wait long at Selkirk\u0027s northern most entrance as Standard Bearer Forrest, aboard the grey-dappled Lizzie, arrived to a cacophony of cheers and shouts of encouragement.\nProud parents, Ann and Rob, as well as girlfriend, Emma Pearce, were the first to offer him their congratulations as a well-deserved breather is taken at The Toll.\nAnd, in time-honoured fashion, his mounted followers made their own spectacular galloping return to the auld toon.\nJoyce Wright, representing the Ladies section of the Rig Committee, presented the traditional riding crop to Standard Bearer Forrest before he remounted to conclude his duties.\nAnd what a conclusion it is.\nThe Casting of the Colours pays homage to the heroic Fletcher, who returned from Flodden with a captured English banner and defiantly cast it around his head before dying.\nTo Up wi\u0027 the Souters Standard Bearer Forrest brought his ceremonial duties to an end with an impeccable cast.\nReflecting on his day, Peter told us: \"Being Standard Bearer was everything I knew it would be and more.\n\"I enjoyed the Marches - really enjoyed it - and my horse Lizzie was great.\n\"You think it can\u0027t get any better then it does. Coming in at The Toll was unbelievable and the Casting was something that will live with me forever.\n\"It has been a truly amazing day and I\u0027d like to thank everyone who came out and supported me.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Casting their places in history","story":"SELKIRK Common Riding is undoubtedly a festival steeped in tradition and commemoration.\nBut it is also a day of contrasts for the followers as well as the ones lucky enough to take part.\nFrom the high-adrenaline riders returning at the Toll, the ecstasy and elation is quietly absorbed by reflection and respect as the colourful procession heads into town.\nBeneath silver skies the rearranged scarlet plinth within the Market Place awaited not only Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest, but the six accompanying Standard Bearers selected by the town\u0026rsquos ancient Societies and Associations.\nTo the growing thrum of expectation, as the hidden clock ticked past eleven, all seven gathered beneath the steps to await a brief minute or two that will live with them forever.\nSince the tragic cast of a blood-soaked English banner more than 500 years ago, this re-enactment both commemorates and celebrates, defiance and pride in equal measure.\nAnd as the Silver Band leads the way with Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters, each Standard Bearer in turn re-enacts and relives this defiant and proud act.\nStandard Bearer Forrest, as he had been all morning, was assured and relaxed as he turned the Royal Burgh Standard above his head.\nIt was as deserved a cheer as any Standard Bearer has received as he smiled, waved and made his way from the gaze of five-thousand eyes.\nCollege lecturer Mark Easson \u0026ndash a painter by trade \u0026ndash resumed where Standard Bearer Forrest had left off. Armed with the Incorporation of Hammermen Banner, the 49-year-old showed a steady hand and perfect timing to provide an impeccable cast.\nHis smile was as deserved as the loud cheer that followed him down the steps.\nFletcher himself was a weaver before that bloody battle in 1513, and Michael Pepper made sure the fabric of the historic Corporation continued unblemished for another year.\nThe 27-year-old textiles worker may have looked a little nervous but as his cast continued his smile grew. Again, the appreciation was richly deserved.\nFormer farmer Jackie Johnston brought experience with him as he provided a perfect cast of the Incorporation of Fleshers Flag.\nIf there were nerves, they didn\u0026rsquot show as the self-employed excavator took it all in his stride, even managing a thumbs-up to the conductor of the Silver Band before dismounting.\nWhile the other Standard Bearers have enjoyed several weeks\u0026rsquo of practice under the guiding gaze of those who have gone before them, Colonial Standard Bearer Alisdair Piercy has been using two broom-handles taped together with an old Scotland flag in his garage in Toronto.\nBut casting the colours is in his blood - the 39-year-old was following in the footsteps of his father, Drew, and grandfather, Archie, by casting the colours.\nAnd the 2018 Colonial Standard Bearer was perfect in every way as he cast the striking yellow banner above his head.\nFollowing the ceremony Alisdair revealed: \u0026ldquoI watched the casting so many times when I was a boy growing up in Selkirk.\n\u0026ldquoBeing up there was amazing \u0026ndash I was ready to start but when that drum sounds it hits you right in the heart.\n\u0026ldquoI was trying not to listen to the band and keep counting in my head, like I\u0026rsquod been told, and I think it worked.\nThe wave and grin from Alisdair were deserved as he savoured every moment on the scarlet plinth.\nOne Standard Bearer who is more familiar with the new-look Market Place than most is architect Stuart Davidson.\nThe 37-year-old dad-of-three has been heavily involved in the ongoing redesign of the town centre.\nStuart was a picture of concentration throughout most of his faultless cast, only allowing himself a huge smile of relief during the final bars of Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters.\nArguably the most poignant of all is saved for last.\nFormer KOSB Martin Young brought with him all the military discipline and reliability you would expect as he carried the Ex-Soldiers\u0026rsquo Association Flag onto the scarlet plinth.\nThe father of two, who is a now a traffic policeman, provided another faultless cast with the Union banner before leading this close-knit community in two minutes of silence and reflection.\nWith the centenary fast approaching of the end of the Great War, the sacrifice made by so many is being brought even

impact it can have on people\u0026rsquos health and well-being.\nThe new law will address longstanding and specific health concerns around the effects of excess alcohol consumption.\nIt is estimated

This legislation will make an important contribution to addressing this issue.\nOnce enacted, the new law will allow Welsh Ministers to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol supplied in Wales.\nIt will make it an offence for alcohol to be supplied below a minimum price made up of that minimum unit price, the strength of the alcohol and its volume, specifically targeting cheap, strong alcohol.\nThe legislation will target and aim to reduce the amount of alcohol being consumed by hazardous and harmful drinkers, whilst minimising impacts on moderate drinkers.\nThe level of the minimum unit price for this purpose will be specified in regulations made by the Welsh Ministers following a consultation this year. The new minimum pricing regime is currently expected to come into force in summer 2019.\nThe Welsh Government will issue guidance and work with retailers, local authorities and trading standards to prepare for implementation.\nAnd there will be a full, ongoing evaluation of the Act once implemented and this information will be used to review the effectiveness of the policy.\nIn Scotland, the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) Act was passed in June 2012 and began in May this year after the supreme court ruled it did not breach European law.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date()a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0]a.async=1a.src=gm.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\u0027script\u0027,\u0027//www.google-analytics/analytics.js\u0027,\u0027ga\u0027)ga(\u0027create\u0027, \u0027UA-72310761-1\u0027, \u0027auto\u0027, {\u0027name\u0027: \u0027pacontentapi\u0027})ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027referrer\u0027, location.origin)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension1\u0027, \u0027By Rod Minchin, Press Association\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension2\u0027, \u0027110882c1-b218-4e60-9ef2-260d51b10d5e\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension3\u0027, \u0027paservice:news,paservice:news:uk\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension6\u0027, \u0027story\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension7\u0027, \u0027composite\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension8\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension9\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.send\u0027, \u0027pageview\u0027, { \u0027location\u0027: location.href, \u0027page\u0027: (location.pathname + location.search + location.hash), \u0027title\u0027: \u0027Wales passes law introducing minimum price for alcohol\u0027})\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Explosion reported at London Tube station","story":"Police have been called to reports of an explosion at a London Tube station.\nA small number of people have had to be treated at the scene in north London, British Transport Police said.\nOfficers were called to reports of a minor explosion and \u0026ldquopeople running at\u0026nbspSouthgate Tube station shortly after 7pm on Tuesday.\nWe remain at Southgate Tube station in London following a reported minor explosion.

Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

Colin Beattie\u0027s comments follows a \"positive meeting\" with health bosses in the wake of patients\u0027 concerns about the service at the enlarged practice in the Musselburgh Primary Care Centre.  The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.  Mr Beattie said: \"There is no doubt that there are issues around patients\u0026rsquo communication with the surgery, particularly at peak times. I was pleased that the surgery has recognised this and was in a position to give me a briefing on the situation.\"  He said doctors were now up to their full staffing level of 14 and an additional four staff members to take phone calls were in the process of being recruited.  During the visit, Mr Beattie had the chance to discuss other new initiatives which were \"positively transforming the surgery\".  He said: \"While much work seems to have been done, more still has to be achieved to improve the service to patients.  \"I am confident that Riverside and East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership are seriously addressing their remaining issues and I will be keeping in close contact going forward to ensure that my constituents receive the service they should expect.\"  He added that the practice was looking at introducing an online appointment booking system, which it is anticipated would reduce phone calls to the practice.  Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":null,"title":"Fund in memory of much-missed Jess Mackie helping others","story":"              A MEMORIAL fund set up following the tragic death of a caring 14-year-old girl is on target to reach \u0026pound10,000 raised.  Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.  But Mr Smith insists he was just a young man doing a job.  He said: \u0026ldquoI didn\u0026rsquot know how the war was going, I didn\u0026rsquot read anything about the war. I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhen we came back my mum was overjoyed, she got three sons back uninjured.  Last year, Mr Smith returned to the Normandy beaches on a British Legion tour organised for veterans. He said: \u0026ldquoI wasn\u0026rsquot involved in the D-Day landings the people that were are the heroes."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7252400.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"  39 Important progress  39  at Knox Academy  say inspectors","story":"              A SECONDARY school which came under fire from Government inspectors last year has made \u0026ldquosome important progress.  Education Scotland visited Knox Academy in Haddington at the end of 2016 and told parents that the school needed to \u0026ldquorevisit its \u0026ldquovision and values.  The inspection report, which was released in March last year, highlighted a number of areas in which the school could improve. \u0026lsquoLeadership of change\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquolearning, teaching and assessment\u0026rsquo were ranked as \u0026lsquosatisfactory\u0026rsquo, while \u0026lsquoensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion\u0026rsquo was described as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo.  Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.

The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.

However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.

They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees. People do not want to see the club close.  Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council confirmed the land was earmarked for leisure and recreation use in the Local Development Plan and any deviation from that would require planning permission for a potential change of use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7297144.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington hosts world record attempt for the Slosh dance","story":"              HUNDREDS of people are set to lace up their dancing shoes in a bid to break a world record.

S6 pupil Ella Higgins said: \"When I first read the script, I immediately loved it and was desperate to perform it.  \"I\u0026rsquove never read or seen anything that fully demonstrates how much resilience is needed to survive in high school as a teenage girl to the extent that this play does and it covers so many issues and scenarios that many girls do experience in real life.  \"This play is such an important and well written piece. I feel so proud to be performing it at the final and I hope we do it justice and get it the recognition it deserves.\"  Holly Edwards, another S6 pupil, said: \"The play is extremely relevant and gives a taste of real life and what really goes on at schools that have such a large social media influence.  \"The competition means a lot to us as a group and the thought of getting to the final is so exciting, we want to show people what this play is all about. After all our hard work we are all so happy to be in the final!

Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington pub seeking new owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

The alcohol side of the business was discussed at a recent meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board in Haddington.  An increase in the display of alcohol of 8.8 square metres was proposed and given the green light by the committee\u0026rsquos councillors.  A detailed statement was provided to the committee which outlined the revamp both inside and outside the shop.  It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality. This will transcend all ranges and lines including alcohol.  \u0026ldquoWhilst alcohol is very much ancillary to the overall offer, there is a desire to incorporate premium wines and craft beers.  In a bid to prevent items being stolen, members heard how various measures were being taken to cut down on the chances of theft.  New CCTV has been installed throughout the store, while various bottles of alcohol are only accessed through a member of staff opening a locked cabinet.  Similarly, a number of \u0026ldquohigh value lines, including alcohol and various cuts of meat, are on \u0026ldquosmart shelves which sense when an item is lifted and alerts a member of staff through a pager.  Musselburgh is the company\u0026rsquos first of its so-called \u0026lsquoClapham-style\u0026rsquo stores in Scotland.  Neil Hayes, Iceland\u0026rsquos merchandising and format development director, said: \u0026ldquoRefurbishments on this scale are only possible if we close the stores for a time and I am grateful to all our customers in Musselburgh for their patience. I am sure that they will feel that it has been worth it when they experience the new store."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7946777.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Wales passes law introducing minimum price for alcohol","story":"              The cost of cheap, strong alcohol is set to rise in Wales after the National Assembly passed a new law introducing a minimum price.  The Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Bill is part of the Welsh Government\u0026rsquos wider efforts to reduce excessive drinking, recognising the impact it can have on people\u0026rsquos health and well-being.  The new law will address longstanding and specific health concerns around the effects of excess alcohol consumption.  It is estimated to lead to nearly 55,000 alcohol-related hospital admissions a year, costing the Welsh NHS more than \u0026pound150 million annually. In 2016, there were 504 alcohol-related deaths in Wales.          Delighted @assemblywales has approved the Public Health (Minimum Price for Alcohol) (Wales) Bill.          This legislation will make an important contribution to addressing the availability of cheap, strong, readily-available alcohol.          More here: https://t.co/CaYQctrIQd pic.twitter/Mb9IfDY1XL          \u0026mdash Vaughan Gething (@wgcs_health) June 19, 2018  The legislation supports the Welsh Government\u0026rsquos strategy to address hazardous and harmful drinking by tackling the availability and affordability of cheap, strong alcohol.  Following approval by Assembly Members, the Bill will become law once it has received Royal Assent.  Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom very pleased the National Assembly has given its seal of approval to our landmark legislation.  \u0026ldquoLast year alone, there were over 500 alcohol-related deaths and nearly 55,000 alcohol-related hospital admissions in Wales, with the direct health care costs attributable to alcohol amounting to an estimated \u0026pound159 million.  \u0026ldquoBut even more of an issue is the devastation that lies behind these figures.  \u0026ldquoDevastation for families, impacts on communities, and consequences for our NHS staff and support services as they all cope with the aftermath of alcohol-related death and disease, every day.  \u0026ldquoThis legislation provides us with an opportunity for a step change. It gives us a chance to do more to address alcohol-related harms.  \u0026ldquoAnd ultimately, it gives us a chance to do more to try to save lives. This legislation takes a sensible, targeted approach to a very real and evident problem in Wales today.  \u0026ldquoBut it will be supported by a range of additional actions being taken forward to support those in need \u0026ndash forming part of the Welsh Government\u0026rsquos wider Substance Misuse Strategy.  \u0026ldquoWales, like so many other western countries, has a problem with cheap, strong, readily-available alcohol. This legislation will make an important contribution to addressing this issue.  Once enacted, the new law will allow Welsh Ministers to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol supplied in Wales.  It will make it an offence for alcohol to be supplied below a minimum price made up of that minimum unit price, the strength of the alcohol and its volume, specifically targeting cheap, strong alcohol.  The legislation will target and aim to reduce the amount of alcohol being consumed by hazardous and harmful drinkers, whilst minimising impacts on moderate drinkers.  The level of the minimum unit price for this purpose will be specified in regulations made by the Welsh Ministers following a consultation this year. The new minimum pricing regime is currently expected to come into force in summer 2019.  The Welsh Government will issue guidance and work with retailers, local authorities and trading standards to prepare for implementation.  And there will be a full, ongoing evaluation of the Act once implemented and this information will be used to review the effectiveness of the policy.  In Scotland, the Alcohol (Minimum Pricing) Act was passed in June 2012 and began in May this year after the supreme court ruled it did not breach European law."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7947066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Explosion reported at London Tube station","story":"              Police have been called to reports of an explosion at a London Tube station.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.

The 53-year-old has gone on trial accused of putting his hand down a woman\u0027s trousers and touching her bottom as they danced at her hen night in Atik nightclub in Edinburgh last June.  The woman, who cannot be identified, said she saw Leslie when they entered the club and recognised him from television, particularly Blue Peter.  Leslie is on trial at Edinburgh Sheriff Court under his real name John Stott and denies the charge.  The accuser was the first to give evidence and said she had spoken to Leslie during the night about football, some of his ex-girlfriends and speculation he could appear in TV programme Celebrity Big Brother.  While dancing with friends and a stag party later in the night she said Leslie approached her and said \"be careful, you\u0027re getting married\".  She said she thought he was being \"protective\" and suggested they dance together.  Leslie had a hand on her waist and she had a hand on his shoulder, the court heard.  The woman said: \"We\u0027d been going in circles then he pulled me closer.  \"I did feel uncomfortable but thought I was maybe reading too much into it.\"  She said she gave her friend \"a look\" to make her aware she was uncomfortable, adding: \"After that I felt his hand go down my trousers at the back.  \"I didn\u0027t know how to react. I made even more of a look to my friend because I knew I needed to be out of that situation.\"  She said Leslie touched her skin but was not sure if he had put his hand beneath her underwear.  The woman told the court a friend pulled her away and then danced briefly with her hen party to \"pretend it hadn\u0027t happened\".  She added: \"But then I got really upset so moved to the booth.\"  \"I asked my friend something like \u0027why did he think he could do that or what did I do to make him do that?\u0027\"  She went outside with a friend and her sister-in-law who said they should tell someone, the court heard.  She said they told a female bouncer and later a police officer at the nightclub who took her to a station to make a statement.  CCTV of the pair dancing in the busy club was played to the court and the woman said it could not be seen exactly when the alleged incident happened.  Asked by fiscal depute Fiona Nairn how she feels now, the woman said it had impacted on her relationship with her husband, friends and work.  She said: \"It\u0027s been one of the toughest years of my life when it should have been the happiest.\"  Under cross examination by defence lawyer Derek Ogg QC, she cried and said: \"I don\u0027t know why anyone would think I made this up. I have nothing to gain from it.\"  Mr Ogg put it to the woman the CCTV footage showed the dance with Leslie ended \"voluntarily\" rather than with a friend\u0027s intervention.  She said: \"That\u0027s not how I see it. I just wanted out of that situation.\"  It was also established that the woman was taken home by two police officers and given paper bags to place her clothing in with no forensic protocol in place.  Forensic scientist Sandra Coupar-White told the court she examined the woman\u0027s trousers, pants and tutu for potential DNA.  She said a mixed profile was found on the trouser waistband likely made up of touch DNA from the woman, Leslie and two other \"minor contributors\".  She told Ms Nairn that DNA could be passed indirectly from holding hands during by dancing but said direct contact with the inside of the waistband was more likely.  The results from the pants and tutu were inconclusive, Ms Coupar-White said.  Mr Ogg questioned if it was possible for Leslie\u0027s DNA to be passed from one item of clothing to another.  The witness said: \"Secondary transfer is possible.\"  The trial before Sheriff Adrian Cottam continues on Friday."},{"url":null,"title":"Watch the moment famed Glasgow hairdresser is surprised with   137K Porsche prize","story":"              A FAMED Glasgow hairdresser received the surprise of a lifetime after winning a top-of-the-range Porsche worth \u0026pound137,000.

I have a strong and very personal and relationship with this wonderful, magical, beautiful building. Over the years I\u0026rsquove seen countless exhibitions at the Mack, done various evening classes, danced and laughed with friends. I\u0026rsquove stood quietly and been bowled over again and again by its sheer elegance and practicality.  And by Saturday the initial sadness I felt turned to anger. How for the love of God could this happen again? How could four years of painstaking research and restoration by hundreds of craftspeople, the rebuilding of the peerless library, the ambitious plan to give every first year student at GSA a chance to study in the Mack, to live and breath its inspiration, have gone up in smoke?  Who or what was responsible for starting the fire and why did it take and spread so quickly? Were there not procedures in place to prevent this inconceivably grim turn of events?  We must be rigorous and ruthless in uncovering answers to all these questions and more in the months to come. In the aftermath of the 2014 fire, such inquiries were overshadowed by the outpouring of goodwill around restoration. This will not be the case this time around, and nor should it be. The people of Glasgow, Scotland and beyond deserve answers, not least because we gave so willingly and generously of our money to fund the restoration that now lies in ruins in Renfrew Street.  Once the fire service has produced its report into the cause of the blaze, a full public inquiry may be the only way to establish where responsibility lies and ensure nothing like this ever happens again.  But another, even more difficult question will soon need attention: what now for the Mack? It is painfully early days, of course, and since we don\u0026rsquot yet know the exact extent of the damage, or how viable the shell of the building may or may not be, at present thinking about the future just makes your head hurt.  But since this building has always been a place of ideas, creativity and ingenuity, I\u0026rsquom trying my damnedest to focus on the positives.  Firstly, the building is not, as some are suggesting, \u0026ldquogone. I went to see what remains twice at the weekend and grim as the experience was, what struck me was the fact that the once beautiful west gable, arguably the finest architectural aspect in Scotland, is still recognisable, as is the iconic front elevation.  Secondly, thanks to an innovative project started after the first fire in 2014, the entire building has been digitised to within a millimetre of its life, both inside and out. In this respect at least The Mack still exists in its full glory, making the experience of the teams that worked on the now destroyed restoration invaluable rather than wasted. We should also remember that many of the surviving fixtures and fittings from the 2014 fire are still in storage.  It will be possible to rebuild the Mack from scratch if that\u0026rsquos what it takes. We should take heart from the Frauenkirche in Dresden, rebuilt after German reunification over 10 years starting in 1994 after it was completely destroyed during World War Two. The miracle rebirth of this beautiful church is now part of its story, something that makes it even more interesting to visitors. Think, too, of the chamber of the House of Commons, totally rebuilt after being razed on the final day of the Blitz in 1941.  The Mack arguably exceeds either of these two buildings in terms of architectural and cultural importance. Its place in the hearts and imaginations of Glaswegians, meanwhile, simply cannot be overstated.  Yes, the cost of rebuilding from scratch would be astronomical - quite possibly into the hundreds of millions - though maybe not as much as a football stadium. And yes, any such project would require a daunting amount of political and civic will to succeed and take many years to realise. But surely if any building deserves this sort of effort, the Mack does.  A build of this scale and ambition would be a heritage project unlike any other undertaken in Scotland, one that could ultimately provide employment and training opportunities for hundreds of people. There are pros as well as cons to be considered. But the biggest pro of all would be the continued existence of the Mack, both as a physical presence and an idea. A world without it would be an eminently poorer place, after all.  Let\u0026rsquos be honest, the original Mack was lost in 2014 what was being re-created and restored until last week was already something new. A complete rebuild would represent yet another, even bigger leap of faith. But it could be done.  Ultimately, it will be up to GSA to decide, and I expect to hear calls for a different future for the site, a less costly one that could be filled with deserving, long-suffering students more quickly. But I believe the people of this great city will galvanise and rebuild their beloved Mack once again if that is what is asked of them. Come on Glasgow, what do you say?"},{"url":null,"title":"Labour demand review of FoI regime under SNP","story":"              LABOUR are demanding an investigation into SNP government secrecy in the wake of a damning report into how ministers mishandled freedom of information requests.  The Scottish Information Commissioner revealed last week that ministers had run a secret two-tier FoI system, making it harder for those most likely to embarrass them.  Requests from the media, MSPs and their researchers faced extra scrutiny, despite the law saying the FoI process should be blind, and each request judged solely on its merits.  The government last week accepted the Commissioner\u0026rsquos report in full and agreed to overhaul its procedure to stop taking into account the identity of requesters.  Ahead of a Holyrood debate on transparency tomorrow, Labour will ask MSPs to back \u0026ldquoan independent review of both FoI handling and the recording of information from meetings.  MSP Rhoda Grant said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Information Commissioner\u0026rsquos damning report reveals repeated attempts by the SNP government to bury bad news.  \u0026ldquoNot only was the clearance process different, but there is some evidence that information was suppressed in answer to these journalists\u0026rsquo requests.  \u0026ldquoThe SNP has so far failed to recognise the seriousness of this unacceptable behaviour and properly take responsibility for it.  \u0026ldquoThat is why Scottish Labour is demanding a full investigation into the SNP\u0027s handling of FOI requests.  \u0026ldquoAnything less would only show that the SNP government simply cannot be trusted.  Meanwhile, the Scottish Liberal Democrats demanded that FoI should be extended to big private contractors delivering public services.  MSP Tavish Scott said ScotRail and the failed contractor Carillion were examples of companies where was a clear public interest in greater transparency.  A survey by the Scottish Information Commissioner found four-fifths of Scots thought organisations building and maintaining schools and hospitals should be subject to FoI.  The government currently spends around \u0026pound11bn a year procuring public services.  Mr Scott said: \u0026ldquoThe public are left with little recourse to uncover how taxpayers\u0027 money is being spent and what level of performance is being achieved.  \u0026ldquoThey want to know whether the contractors maintaining our roads or running our railways and prisons are doing a good job.  \"Some of these firms are vast behemoths handling as much public money as a government department or council, so this is a crucial step to making these firms accountable.\"  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoScotland already has the most open, far-reaching freedom of information laws in the UK \u0026ndash we are working to widen the coverage even further and welcome all suggestions as to how that can be done.  \u0026ldquoLegislation has previously been expanded to a range of arm\u0026rsquos-length-organisations providing cultural, leisure and sporting services on behalf of local authorities, private prison contractors, providers of secure accommodation to children and young people, and grant-aided and independent special schools.  \"An order to extend FOISA to Registered Social Landlords is currently under consideration.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue to assess options to further expand coverage, and whether other private companies exercising public functions should be brought within scope."},{"url":null,"title":"Producer behind Oscar-nominated film The Lobster named director of Screen Unit","story":"              A FILM executive who has worked on a series of award-winning films is to lead Scotland\u0027s new screen funding body.

A panel of banking executives told Holyrood\u0027s Economy Committee that pre-consultation with customers was not a factor in the decision-making process.  MSPs have been examining the impact of bank closures in the wake of RBS\u0027 decision to shut at least 52 branches across the country, with a further 10 under review.  SNP MSP Gillian Martin quizzed the panel on whether they held any consultation with customers and communities before taking the decision to shut a branch.  Susan Allen, head of customer interactions at Santander UK, said: \"We don\u0027t do formal consultation with customers before any closures.  \"We fully adhere to the access to banking standards as you would expect. The other thing we do take into account in making our decisions is representations reps from our own local teams.\"  Robin Bulloch, managing director at Lloyds Bank and Bank of Scotland, said: \"We don\u0027t consult formally as has been said already its not a requirement of the standard.  \"I would be concerned with a pre-consultation creating quite a high degree of uncertainty for customers and colleagues about the possible outcome.\"  Simon Watson, managing director of personal banking at RBS, said: \"There is no structured customer consultation... but we do look at what our customers actually do, where they bank and how they bank before we take any decision.  \"On the issue of consultation... it is difficult to know where that would start and stop, so there is a practical issue with that.  \"The approach we take to look at what customers are actually doing, how can we best support them and what alternatives are available, is a sound basis.  \"I think the way that we all go about it at the moment is very similar and I think it\u0027s very difficult to see how a consultation reaches a different or better decision.\"  Mr Watson was rebuked by Labour MSP Jackie Baillie for failing to provide information requested by the committee on the number of RBS bank branches now as compared to 2010.  She cited two examples - in Alexandria and Arrochar - where local communities had been left without facilities following an RBS closure.  Ms Baillie said: \"You said that when a bank closes you wanted to leave something behind in the community. What did you leave behind in Alexandria?  \"Given you talk about it wouldn\u0027t be a closure and then nothing, it felt like a closure and then nothing in Arrochar.\"  Mr Watson responded: \"If we\u0027ve fallen short on that occasion then I\u0027m very sorry, I\u0027m very happy to continue the discussion about Alexandria and the specifics.  \"We always try to deliver on our promises and commitments and if we didn\u0027t in that case then I\u0027m very sorry.  \"There\u0027s any number of options we could look at, there are individual circumstances in some communities where it might take us longer to do that but I\u0027m not aware of where there\u0027s been anything where we\u0027ve not been able to provide some kind of suitable alternative and I\u0027m very happy to take up the specific case of Arrochar.\"  He told the committee an independent reviewer had been appointed to review the future of the 10 RBS branches offered a reprieve, with further details to be announced in the coming days."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7809695.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Council withdraws  People Make Glasgow  support for    Trident showcase    arms fair","story":"              THE People Make Glasgow branding has been removed from promotional material for an arms fair in Glasgow, described by protesters as a \u0026ldquoTrident showcase.  There had been concern that Glasgow City Council sanctioned the Undersea Defence Technology 2018 event planned due to open next week at the SEC, which is run by a company that is 91% owned by the local authority.  There is further concern that the council\u0027s arms-length leisure services charity Glasgow Life is adding its support to the event, lending its \u0027People Make Glasgow\u0027 city branding to the promotional material.  But now it has been confirmed that the logo has been removed.    BEFORE (above) and AFTER (below).    The event at the Scottish Event Campus, will see dozens of firms from around the world gather to promote defence and security equipment.  BAE Systems and Babcock International, which are designing and constructing a new fleet of Trident nuclear submarines, are lead sponsors of the fair.  The city council in defending the event say it was held in Glasgow in 2008 and had stressed conferences and exhibitions are worth \u0026pound130 million to the local economy each year.  But now Glasgow City Council has confirmed that the while it has not changed \"practical support\" for the event, it had been decided that the People Make Glasgow log should be removed.  A spokesman said: \u0026ldquoOur conventions team uses the brand \u0026ndash and, in this case, that reflected the practical support they offer to event organisers and venues in the city.    \u0026ldquoAt the same time, the brand is hugely popular and we appreciate that people in the city feel some sense of ownership of it \u0026ndash which is a really positive thing.  \u0026ldquoThere was clearly some confusion about what it represented on this occasion, so we agreed with the organiser that it was better to remove it.  Scottish CND were among groups that had previously confirmed they planned to hold a demonstration during the three-day gathering, which opens on June 26.  And Jay Sutherland of Scotland Against Militarism said the group \u0026ldquowon\u0026rsquot be backing down until full support is removed.  She said: \"The decision to use the logo was completely hypocritical to begin with when most people in Glasgow who are aware of this Arms Fair oppose it.    \"Scotland Against Militarism and the Sink UDT Campaign first pushed for them to remove the branding with our meeting with Susan Aiken, this was not a decision that the council came to themselves.  \"Most of all it shows that people power works and that the council realise they have got it completely wrong, but they are still refusing to remove full support. They recognise that people have claimed the brand but what they don\u0026rsquot realise is that people own the city too and we are not putting up with this.  \"We won\u0026rsquot be backing down until they remove their full support for the event, nothing less. Otherwise they are simply hiding their interests and involvement.\"    Campaign Against the Arms Trade\u0026rsquos Kate Nevens said it is crucial the council put a framework in place for future events.  She said: \u0026ldquoHosting a major arms fair is completely incompatible with a city like Glasgow, which is anti-nuclear and famous for its opposition to war.  UDT, now in its 31st year, has been sold in promotional material as a forum to allow businesses to \"engage with the undersea defence community, network and meet prospective customers, showcase your products and services and reinforce your commitment to this ever-evolving domain\".      The promoters say it provides arms companies with the chance to \"meet face-to-face\" with over 1,400 international, senior military and industry leaders\".  It is organised by Clarion Events, which has hosted family-friendly gatherings such as the Baby Show, the Horse Show and the Spirit of Christmas. Since 2008, it has acquired six arms fairs and joined the arms industry trade body ADS.  In September last year, more than 100 people were arrested at protests outside a controversial Defence and Security Equipment International arms fair which Clarion organised.  A Sink the Arms Fair coalition opposing the Glasgow event includes Scottish CND, Campaign Against the Arms Trade Scotland, Scotland Against Militarism, Scottish Palestine Solidarity Campaign, Dovetales, Food Not Bombs, Catholic Worker and the Scottish Peace Network.  \u0026nbsp  Glasgow Life declined to comment."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/5016233.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Cricket stump from Scotland s historic win over England to help MND cure research","story":"              A STUMP from Scotland historic win over England in one-day match is to be auctioned to help support research into a cure for\u0026nbspMotor Neurone Disease.

The charity, which is being supported by The Wood Foundation as it expands its reach in the North-east, hopes to eventually be active in every City and Shire secondary school.                                                    The North-east is the first area for the nationwide expansion of the programme outside of Glasgow. Aberdeen has the second highest proportion of young people failing to move onto \u0026lsquopositive destinations\u0026rsquo when they leave school.        The Wood Foundation\u0026rsquos UK Director Ali MacLachlan said: \u0026ldquoNurturing young people at this crossroads in their lives is vitally important in terms of supporting them to find the right path to fulfil their potential.\u0026ldquoPeople may be surprised to learn that the North-east has such high rates of young people unable to move onto positive destinations after school. We must harness the potential of these young people to support the current and future economic performance of our region.\u0026ldquoMany of these vulnerable young people lack the stability and support many of us take for granted. This imbalance is something the programme aims to address.\u0026ldquoMCR Pathways has already demonstrated significant impact and we are pleased to support its introduction to the North-east.                                                                                                        The Wood Foundation will be hosting an open event next week to inform potential mentors and business partners about the programme.A mentor meets a young person weekly in their school. They provide a listening ear and supportive voice \u0026ndash a constant adult role model who will build confidence, aspirations and a route to meaningful training or employment. Mentors are trained to guide young people through subject choices, training and professional routes to broaden their mind-sets and realise their potential.One of the opportunities, which requires support from the local business community, is \u0026lsquoTalent Tasters\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash a bite-sized work experience programme showing young people different aspects of industry.Iain MacRitchie of MCR Pathways said: \u0026ldquoA young person\u0026rsquos future should be determined by their potential, never their circumstances. Our mentoring scheme levels the playing field and gives young people structured, enthusiastic and dedicated support to really find a way to realise and achieve their goals as they make that transition from childhood to their adult lives.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoWe are very proud of what the programme and our young people have achieved to date and we have no doubt the same successes will be realised in the North-east where we have recognised a real need and desire for this support.\u0026lsquoPathways Coordinators\u0026rsquo have been hired for each of the six schools and will begin work after the summer break. They support pupils in S1 and 2 and match them with a mentor from S3.MCR Pathways is already operational across all Glasgow secondary schools where more than 1300 young people are supported each week through a mixture of group work, mentoring and work-based \u0026lsquoTalent Taster\u0026rsquo opportunities. More than 80% of mentored participants have moved onto further education, higher education or employment in sharp contrast to the national figure of 54%.Businessman Iain MacRitchie launched the charity in 2007 after being shocked by a professional experience restructuring a youth care business. While the business health was restored, the poor outcomes for young people remained the same and he realised the need for relationship-based, meaningful support.He commented: \u0026ldquoThat professional experience was a real eye-opener for me, seeing that these young people were not getting the support they needed and nowhere near achieving their potential. I vowed then to do something and have taken time out from my business to make a difference. This programme really does deliver profound results for some of the most vulnerable in our society.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoHelping a young person onto the right path at this stage really is life-changing. We continuously hear incredible stories including a mentee who went from a homeless unit to medical school and another who had to contend with family addiction issues and was four years behind in their education to graduating university and becoming a building surveyor.\u0026ldquoTheir stories, among countless other, have spurred us to roll out this project nationwide and we look forward to hearing of the successes of North-east youngsters in the years to come.The first information event for individuals and businesses keen to support the programme in the North-east will be held at The Wood Foundation\u0026rsquos office in Aberdeen on Monday, June 18.To register, or for more information on future events, please contact Alison.maclachlan@thewoodfoundation.org.uk.

Once accepted, training includes support from other groups such as stroke awareness, Hearing and Sight Care and Parkinson\u0026rsquos awareness.Befriending Caithness is not a standalone organisation \u0026ndash it is helped by the community.An event to look out for is a fashion show at M\u0026ampCo in Thurso on June 28, starting at 7pm.

When he left the club and took over the national team he asked me to come help with a few bits, and from there I\u0026rsquove been working with the team since November 2017.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not based in Croatia. I only come into the country for the preparations and matches, but when I\u0026rsquom there everyone is very friendly and welcoming.\u0026ldquoThe language is very difficult but luckily most of the team and all the staff speak English. Croatia is a beautiful country and the food is delicious so it\u0026rsquos always a pleasure to go over.\u0026ldquoWhen I\u0026rsquom there you see the culture is a strong passionate people but they are also very considerate and well mannered in general, with everyone happy to help each other out.\u0026ldquoIn my current role I am responsible for the gathering and compiling of our information to share with the coaching staff on the opposition and our own performances and training sessions, then to make that information available through video and written documents.\u0026ldquoWe record all our performances in training through GPS and video and then feed that back each night. Along with this we look to prepare our team through use of video meetings and documents on the opposite team.\u0026ldquoMy role is very much a support role for the coaches where I produce information so they can make the best and most informed decisions.\u0026ldquoThe post-match sessions are used to highlight areas which we can improve and the players are very professional and take this on board and process it into better performances where required next time.\u0026ldquoAs for Croatia\u0026rsquos World Cup campaign, the process began when we saw the draw for the group stages and we\u0026rsquove been building to now since then.Marc says a large chunk of his success has come down to the support of family and friends back home in Caithness.His grannies Nanette Plowman (Wick) and Lilian Campbell (Castletown) both still live in Caithness.Marc added: \u0026ldquoAll of my grandparents and my mum have been very supportive of me throughout my life and have always encouraged me to continue to do better. We speak each week and they always give me a boost in energy through encouragement.\u0026ldquoI always know they are there to support me and my little family and we are forever grateful for their love and support.\u0026ldquoPlus all of my aunts, uncles and cousins have also had an influence in who I am and what I do today.

Few local high street businesses remain in Tain, Mr Stone\u0026rsquos home town.\u0026ldquoThe presence of these empty and increasingly derelict properties undermines one of the most important industries of the Highlands \u0026ndash namely tourism, he says.\u0026ldquoI would therefore suggest that properly tackling this problem should now be one of the most urgent issues for both the UK and Scottish governments.\u0026ldquoThis problem can no longer be ducked by plans that turn out to be more about words than actions \u0026ndash or, worse still, by means of the argument that the decline in the UK\u0026rsquos high street retail sector is inevitable.\u0026ldquoIf we really value our communities and their built heritage, then we must use every means at our disposal \u0026ndash grants, infrastructure investment, tax breaks, local and national planning \u0026ndash so that we can find new ways of bringing these buildings back into sustainable use.Speaking yesterday, Mr Stone said: \u0026ldquoIt pains me greatly to see what is happening, and also to witness nothing better than fine words and hand-wringing when it comes to tackling the problem.\u0026ldquoThis letter is my first move in a campaign that I am going to pursue with the greatest vigour.

All the small local post offices and all the postboxes between Berriedale and Lybster had to have the mail uplifted on this run.Now two trucks each morning bring the mail north from Inverness and Murray has been working mainly, since these changes, on the rural run through Occumster, Roster, Clyth, Bruan and Ulbster.Murray frequently found himself stuck in snow in past winters and has been rescued by farmers pulling him out of drifts in the rural hinterland of south-east Caithness.He served under three postmasters in Lybster \u0026ndash firstly as a part-time postie as well as being a fisherman under the late Hugh Gunn, whose father before him had been the Lybster postmaster.

Murray duly delivered Annie\u0026rsquos mail having firstly helped with the other delivery, and on to his next stop.A collection was taken in Lybster Post Office and the money was handed over by local postmaster Duncan Winfield accompanied by wife Gail in a small ceremony on June 6.Tuesday 19 Jun 2018 9:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04109000/04109865.jpg","title":"Wick museum set for another busy year","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIan Leith, chairman of the Wick Society, made the plea after being re-elected to the post at the annual general meeting on Thursday night.\u0026ldquoIn the open season last year we had in excess of 5000 people, which was a good bit up on previous years, and this year looks as though it\u0026rsquos heading very much the same way, Mr Leith said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos busy, with a lot of tourists coming in.

He was an apprentice in a Greenock shipyard and returned to Wick to establish his own shipbuilding business, constructing over 50 vessels in as many years as well as designing and building many harbours. He was involved in the construction of the breakwater at Wick harbour.A local author, John Mowat, once described Mr Bremner as \u0026ldquothe Ulysses of the north and \u0026ldquoour greatest Caithnessian.Mr Bremner is still remembered in Keiss with a plaque at the harbour erected by the Institution of Civil Engineers.Tuesday 19 Jun 2018 9:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"June 19, 2018 at 4:25 pmThe Orkney public are being asked for their views on the latest version of the Orkney Local Biodiversity Action Plan.

That simply makes it a must-attend event for Orkney’s premium food and drink firms, giving them the chance to showcase their products to a very wide audience of potential customers.

Feedback gathered will help us as we review route and timetable specifications for the 2020-2025 contract.”Both the ‘Bus Users’ and ‘Non-Bus Users’ surveys are available from the ‘Consultation and Engagement’ section of the council website. The direct link is available here.Paper copies are available on request from the Council’s Transportation Team for those unable to access the online surveys, by emailing transport@orkney.gov.uk or calling tel 01856 873535 ext 2539.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Orkney Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.”A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council has said the local authority is unable to comment at this stage as to date, a proposal has not been received by the council.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.
