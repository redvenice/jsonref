There’s some crazy driving, and so much dust in the air.I tried to take pictures before they started, but nobody really wanted to speak with me then and everyone was really nervous. When the race began, I took some shots from the ground, but then I jumped into a car and just hoped the photos would work out. I couldn’t really focus on what I was doing – you’re just trying not to have an accident. There were maybe 40 to 50 cars, and they were all quite beat up. You could tell they’d had accidents before.Afterwards, there was a huge party, right there, in the middle of the steppe. The horses were all beautifully dressed up and traditional Tuvan music was playing. The shaman had prayed the evening before for the spirits to be gentle. People come there to ask for healing.In Soviet times, Tuvan culture was suppressed. The shaman masks and  spirits – little puppets, sculptures, stuffed animals – were destroyed, and the people who continued to follow their ancient religions and traditions were persecuted. Now there’s this big revival, a newfound sense of pride.I grew up with Slavic fairytales about shamans and Baba Yaga. My mother is Russian and my grandfather was from Siberia. But I never really saw more of the country than Moscow, where I’d go to visit my grandmother in the summer. So last year I decided to go an exchange to Tomsk State University, in Siberia. I wanted to explore my roots.My plan was to travel the length of the Yenisei river. I couldn’t get to the actual source, which is further south in neighbouring Mongolia and only accessible by private helicopter. So I travelled to Tuva. You drive through what feels like endless Siberian woods and forested landscapes, you traverse one last mountain and suddenly you emerge on to the steppe. It feels like you’ve entered another world.People have gone there in search of freedom: adventurers, apostates, the Cossack riders pushing deeper and deeper into Siberia, criminals fleeing the Tsar. I met a man called Yuri who lived on a landfill. He told me if they chase him away, he’ll just find another landfill to live on. An ex-army officer I met, called Valentin, described himself as an anarchist ecologist. He sleeps outdoors, even when it’s -50C. This is one of the last remaining places where you can be removed from all western cultural influence, and live at one with nature.People in Tuva are tough. I’m attracted to people who are shaped by their environment, who choose to live or work in extreme situations. I think this kind of life fosters a certain kind of character. Not everyone chooses to live here, though. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Tuva has become a place of great isolation, spiritual, physical and social.One day I went to a village where mostly Tuvan people live. Two grandmothers came outside. Perhaps because of the way I was dressed, they thought I was American. “What the hell are you doing here?” they said. “It’s Friday today. Everyone just got paid. Everyone is drunk, on their horses. Get out of here, it’s too dangerous.” And right then, two very drunk guys rode up to us. Nothing happened. But the horse came to symbolise for me this dualism – the quest for freedom and the pervasive isolation.• Nanna Heitmann is the winner of 2019’s Leica Oskar Barnack newcomer award for her series Hiding From Baba Yaga.Training: Photojournalism and documentary photography, University of Hanover.Influences: “The Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow with its old Russian masters, the Magnum archive, Joel Sternfeld, Tarkovsky.”High point: “Every time I go out to photograph, to e into other people’s worlds.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.First up, an admirable post from steevieb, who has had a change of heart about Elizabeth Strout’s Olive Kitteridge:Some time ago (years) I began reading Olive Kitteridge. Just couldn’t get on with it though, got bored with the small town America bit. Last week I decided to give it another go, I am so glad I did, totally blew me away, beautifully written, I loved every page so much that I immediately bought Amy and Isabelle, which to me was even better. How I could have been bored by it (Olive K) the first time around is a puzzle. Moods, I guess.Tom Mooney has also been rereading some classics:Hemingway’s The Old Man and the Sea, not for the first time. It is wonderful, perfect even. I found some of it a little tougher to read this time, particularly the killing of the sharks (I had been reading a LOT of Cormac McCarthy around the time I read it before so was likely very desensitised!) but it stands up magnificently to repeated reading.I must be in the mood for old stuff as I also recently reread The Swimmer, John Cheever’s glorious masterpiece of a short story. It’s one of my all-time favourites and shows what a sharp writer he was.Night Waking by Sarah Moss has satisfied BobHammond2:Set on the fictional Scottish island of Colonsay, academic Anna is trying to juggle the challenges of motherhood, marriage, her academic career and a fair amount of sleep deprivation - and then a mystery around a baby’s skeleton buried outside her house on the island. Overlaid on top of this is a separate timeline where we see, throughout the book, a series of letters written by a midwife sent to the island back in the late 1800s to improve infant mortality. So, Moss has a lot to juggle but she does it brilliantly and the two separate stories and all the loose threads are brought together at the end of the book for a very satisfying conclusion.fuzzywuzz has enjoyed The Body by Bill Bryson:What a marvellous adventure I have been on, taking a tour of the various organ systems within a human being. Although I studied biochemistry and physiology in my student days, I have learned some interesting new things and revisited already known facts.What I particularly like about Bryson’s style here is that he has taken some complex subject areas such as immunology and transfusion science and distilled them into something which can be mentally digested by those without a scientific background and does so without patronising the reader.ID673795 has enjoyed Caravan of the Lost and Left Behind by Deirdre Shanahan:The story of a woman traveller and her son returning from chaotic lives in England to live on a traveller’s site in Ireland with her father, where she also hopes to find her daughter, left there as a baby. The landscape is beautifully described and the story very sad but in the end hopeful.BanjoGuru has just finished But Beautiful by Geoff Dyer “which I enjoyed a lot”:I was expecting straight biographies of some jazz greats, but it’s an altogether stranger beast - part imagined, part true, full of shifting perspectives and illusions and some really perceptive and evocative prose. I can recommend it if you like jazz, or even if you don’t.Now this is a funny and wise book. The quips and cultural insights are ridiculously true. Especially about the X and Y generations. Professor Chandra himself is a true delight … I found myself asking, “So who IS this smart guy who wrote this fine book?” That’s when you know it’s a good’un. This book is smart, hilarious, and best of all ... kindhearted. Yes, filled with an open hearted way of looking at the people we love and our struggles as well as struggles of our world and culture today.Finally, MarGar65 has just finished Penelope Fitzgerald’s Innocence:I loved it. I am so glad her books have come into my life! What an observant author ... What trust she places in us as she unfolds her stories. She refuses to bend to the expectation of a happy ending. I fear I am running out of To-Be-Read Fitzgeralds ... This is most alarming in a sense because I will run out of new Fitzgeralds, but I am relieved when I think that I can go always go back and reread them all.Going back to reread Fitzgerald sounds like an admirable idea. Just the kind of thing that should get us through winter…If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

Asking a child or teenager “how are you?” can often be met with a standard “fine” as a response. That noise you hear? It’s the door slamming shut on your discussion.So whatever the situation, don’t be stuck for a way in – get talking with these cracking starters …You don’t have to kick things off on a serious note. In fact, some of our most valuable interactions come from having a laugh – lightening the mood can really help some people to open up and discuss how they’re feeling in greater depth. Why not try one of these openers?If you were stuck on a desert island …… and could have only one book, one album, and one meal forevermore, what would you choose and why? It’s the perfect gateway question to discovering a person’s favourite things, and then, of course, debating why they might be terrible or actually rather marvellous.If you won £10m, how would you spend it?What’s it going to be then? A fleet of sports cars? A private chef for life? Multiple trips to space on board a Virgin Galactic? All of the above? This one is great for stretching your imagination (in line with an imaginary bank balance).Would you rather? …This one is an endless source of amusement for every age. Kids particularly love grim options, such as “Would you rather be covered in fur or covered in scales?” Or “Would you rather be pelted with fish guts or horse poo?” These types of questions are a great way of winning over even the shyest of children.If you could go back in a time machine, where would you go and what would you do?You might want to change the course of political history, head into the distant past to see how the pyramids were really built, or check out a T-Rex in the flesh. The possibilities are fascinating and endless.Which super power would you have and why?Of course the answer is the power of flight. Or is it invisibility? Or teleportation? Or the ability to read minds – which would be terribly helpful to cat owners. Or would it be to have arms that can turn into giant crab pincers?Of course, there are times to have fun and times to try to reach out to those around you in a more considered way. It may be that your child has been unusually withdrawn, or that you’re aware that something isn’t right but haven’t been able to find the right words to open up a discussion with them. Here are a few options to try.How would you describe yourself in five words?This question can be a great way in for understanding how a person is feeling about themselves, and if they’re in a good place or having a hard time . Positive responses usually mean a positive outlook, while negative answers can help you glean a deeper understanding of what they’re struggling with.Tell me three things about your dayUnlike the classic “how was your day?” this question shows you have a real interest in the answer, and will prompt a more detailed, considered response that could potentially spark an important conversation. What was the hardest part of your day, and why?This might prove tricky to answer, but it can be a really useful question to ask if you feel that your child is in some kind of distress. By helping them pinpoint the most difficult part of their day, you might be able to unlock a broader discussion about how they’re feeling, and why.What are you thankful for today, and why?It may seem counterintuitive – especially if you’re in a hard place – but gratitude exercises can play an important role in improving mental wellbeing. Helping your child to pinpoint things they are thankful for every day, even if it’s just one or two small things, can help them lift their mood and gain some perspective.Is there anything that you need from me? Space, time to talk, time to do something fun? …Even if you manage to get them to open up, as a parent or carer, it can sometimes be hard to know how to best support a child or teenager who is having a hard time. If you find yourself in that situation, one of the best things you can do is ask them outright. This clear, open conversation starter even gives them some possible options for how to respond.And one last thing … These suggestions are all here to help you break the ice, possibly start a debate or score a laugh, but most importantly, connect on a deeper level.

How different is today’s capital?“The parish is essentially sober but very immoral,” the Reverend H Bloomer told one of social reformer Charles Booth’s researchers at the end of the 19th century. He claimed to have been personally responsible for closing 20 brothels, though four to his knowledge remained.It’s not very shocking that my neighbourhood in Jeremy Corbyn’s North Islington constituency was a den of vice in late Victorian times. After all, Hornsey Road was formerly known as the Devil’s Lane and frequented by highwaymen. The superb Hornsey Road blog once attempted to exorcise my manor’s diabolical reputation with the ironic tag line “probably not over a hell mouth”. That suggestion of eternal recurrence would explain a lot about Hornsey Road – why present-day highwaymen on mopeds nicked the phone from my hands a few years ago why a London knife crime map would require a lot of ink in that section why the Hamlet Cafe, whose walls feature a reproduction of Delacroix’s graveyard scene, captures the manor’s gloomy vibe and why police and councillors clamped down on Aqua Sauna in 2013, saying the feared Romanian women found working there would be be “harmed or exploited”.More likely my manor isn’t cursed, just historically struggling against poverty. That’s what Booth tried to capture between 1886 and 1903 by surveying the capital. He and his team of researchers walked every street in London, filling 450 notebooks with their finds and producing 60 maps, hand-coloured to indicate the level of poverty. Now those maps and edited highlights from their reports are being republished with input from researchers at the London School of Economics. The LSE has an online facility to compare then with the current situation, with modern underlay maps beneath Booth’s poverty maps.“Surely this is the right moment,” argues Iain Sinclair in the book’s foreword, “when isions between the visibly wretched and the invisibly rich in corporate, de-localised London are becoming critical, to publish a handsome, reconfigured presentation of Charles Booth’s inspirational reckoning?”Some things have not changed hugely in London. The map indicates a huge workhouse on Cornwallis Road like so many other smithies and factories, it’s long gone, and the site is now an adventure playground and park. But in November 1897, one of Booth’s researchers, George H Duckworth – who was not only an Etonian, a Cambridge cricket blue but also Virginia Woolf’s half-brother – strolled up Hornsey Road with Insp William Dyball, describing it as “a road of small shops that depend for their existence on local knowledge: they give credit which the large houses on Holloway Rd and 7 Sisters Rd will not do”. That sounds about right: even today, chain stores are rare and buying products “on tick” is possible, as long as the proprietors know you.On Booth’s poverty map, terraces running perpendicular to Hornsey Road are coloured brown, which means: “Mixed. Some comfortable, others poor.” My cul de sac, running parallel to Hornsey Road, still fits that description. We’ve got all sorts down here – Poles, Afghans, Pakistanis, City traders, tube train drivers, Nigerians, Cypriots, Muslims worshipping at the mosque round the corner, non-Muslims worshipping at the William Hill next door, council tenants, a declining number of people of Irish descent, Hooray Henry private tenants. Not to mention people like me who bought cheaply these modest late Victorian ex-council houses after Margaret Thatcher’s right-to-buy legislation and are now sitting on nest eggs that scramble the property market so as to exclude younger people.Beyond my garden fence, there was once a street of grander houses coloured red for “Middle class, well to do”. The Luftwaffe did for them as they did for many of the homes in Booth’s map. Today Tollington Place’s bomb site is Wray Crescent Open Space, with cricket pitch, playground, and community-maintained raised beds. Let’s not overstate the bucolic makeover, however: the leafy corners have long proved handy for drug deals.Not far away from Tollington Place on Booth’s map is a street that sticks out like a sore thumb, since it is coloured black, signifying as Booth put it: “Lower class. Vicious, semi-criminal”. That was Campbell Road, aka the Bunk, which from the 1860s until it was cleared as a slum in the 1950s was known as the worst street in London. Nearby, next to Hornsey Road Baths are two streets coloured light blue, defined as: “Poor. 18s to 21s a week for a moderate family.” On the other side of Hornsey Road are two streets coloured dark blue, defined as: “Very poor, casual. Chronic want.”These mean streets have been disappeared, but the neighbourhood still retains some of its earlier character. Those light blue streets, Marcellus Road and Orpingley Road, were both demolished in 1972 to make way for the Andover Estate, where Ann Widdecombe once made an exploitation doc about her battle with “the hoodies”, to which the local youth responded with their own YouTube documentary Beyond the Hoodie.The dark blue streets, Denmark Terrace and Ellenborough Road have also gone, replaced by the jewel in my neighbourhood’s social housing crown: Sussex Place, described in Pevsner as “an eight-storey crescent in red brick with lower blocks enclosing a garden: an ambitious post-war Islington scheme of 1950 by Monson, spaciously laid out, in startling contrast to the tight street of low stuccoed houses which then existed all around.” It’s as though the council was trying to lift the historic curse.In other parts of the city, however, the change to London has been dramatic. I look at Booth’s map of King’s Cross: the black-coloured streets are gone as gentrification sweeps across the formerly desolate railway land behind the station the then functioning gasometers, Booth would have been astounded to discover, have been repurposed as luxury flats – £810,000 for a studio and rising into the many millions for a penthouse, but handy for workers at Google’s London HQ nearby.One of Booth’s volunteers asked a police constable to describe Clerkenwell, just up the road from Shoreditch. He responded that it was a “melting pot” of London. Which sounds like a lovely meeting point for migrant communities, prefiguring the cosmopolitan London of the 21st century. Not really: what he meant was that Clerkenwell was “where all the stolen silver or jewels come to be melted or disassembled”. It’s less Dickensian and more genteel than that today.I wander off Seven Sisters Road to find out what happened to the Bunk. Today it is called Whadcoat Street, an anonymous dead end that became briefly notorious a couple of years ago when a terrorist drove into a crowd of Muslim worshippers nearby, killing a man.On the other is City North, a vast new development around and above Finsbury Park tube, where flats of up to £850,000 are being advertised overseas, as if the better to attract the speculative investors who have already put much of London’s property beyond its citizens, thus adding to the inequality and poverty in the capital identified by Trust for London.• Charles Booth’s London Poverty Maps is published on 31 October by Thames and HudsonFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5a7100613ee132932ba9cfff24776c9b789e5a1/0_223_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35f27db8fb814383c3b82ea22905cc44","title":"10 timeless fashion trends that never date","story":"Iconic staples rule the catwalk this season. And the best news? They’re probably already in your wardrobe …Is there anything more satisfying, fashion wise, than seeing a trend on the catwalk that you’ve already got in your wardrobe? Iconic classics that stand the test of time are the ultimate rebuff to “What was I thinking?” fads. Here, we reveal the timeless prints, styles and colours you’ll want to wear again and again.From snake to zebra, plus a few tigers on the prowl, the collections walked on the wild side this season. But leopard knocks the spots off every other print. Why? It’s universally flattering, powerful, seductive and, most likely, already in your closet.If only real life was as rose-tinted as the catwalks, where this most feminine of hues proliferated in shades from millennial to bubblegum and beyond. Is the use of pink a celebration of girl power, a protest, or simply a delicious pop of colour? If you ask us, it’s all three.The bourgeois tweed blazer, the rainproof mackintosh, a tartan wool coat: check autumnwinter outerwear off your list. Throw in argyle and houndstooth for the full compendium of this brilliantly British trend.The ultimate nine-to-five look in the 1960s and 1970s, the gloriously girly pussy-bow blouse has stood the test of time, with contemporary fans including Kate Middleton and Amal Clooney. Team yours with a midi skirt and boots for polished perfection or high-rise jeans and loafers for nonchalant chic.Say yes to the (midi) dressSeen at: Celine, Dior, Chloé, Dries Van Noten, Erdem, Fendi, Givenchy, Helmut Lang, Hermes, RoksandaVersatile and flattering, a great midi dress can take you from the office to a party in any season. Getting maximum mileage out of a midi is all about the styling: go casual with ankle boots and a biker jacket, or up your game with 1970s stack heeled knee-highs and a trench.Military is the ultimate ally in men’s fashion, as timeless as a pair of Clarks shoes, and it works in a full battalion of styles. Start with the classic trench, relax with a pair of cargo pants, make a statement in a flying jacket and rely on khaki as your go-to shade for everything.Fifty shades of greySeen at: Dior Homme, Dries Van Noten, Louis Vuitton, Valentino, Prada, LemaireGrey is the ultimate neutral – it goes with everything, works in every format, and can be endlessly reworn. But if you only have three grey garments, go for a charcoal suit, a crisp grey T-shirt and a classic knit.Depend on denimSeen at: Marni, Margaret Howell, Off-White, E TautzDenim as a fashion stalwart? You don’t say. This season, denim is on especially good form the autumnwinter catwalks were loaded with oversized denim – a welcome reprieve from the bad old days of the sprayed-on skinny jean.Take the biscuitSeen at: Burberry, Dries Van Noten, Zegna, Fendi, Lemaire, Loewe, Rochas, Ferragamo, WooyoungmiCustard cream. Malted milk. Bourbon. There’s a delicious hint of the biscuit barrel to the new season’s palette, so layer up in cosy neutral shades as the weather cools.Drop your vision of an irate football manager in a duvet coat – if you shop clever, a padded jacket is a stylish, hardy perennial. To ensure yours looks fresh for years, look for plumped-up panels and a removable hood. Colour? Keep things classic with navy, khaki, grey or black.Fashion trends that stand the test of time need a shoe that is just as hard working. With a wide range of colours, prints and styles, the classic shapes and comfort fits of Clarks’s new AW19 range provides the perfect final touch, whatever the trend."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f8b72ea15fd726b9619d6ae4947e08ec253b217/3070_294_3143_1886/master/3143.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4524b5b3c3156ca84d93c81d194daf7c","title":"food banks childrens books britain hungry election","story":"Britain’s first picture book about families going hungry is an urgent reminder of the issues at the heart of this electionI have just read a beautiful book about something truly obscene. Full of lovely pictures and occasional bits of text, it’s the kind you might read with your four-year-old. It shows a little girl and her mum as they visit a food bank.It’s a No-Money Day is narrated by the daughter who sees how her mother worries over every penny, while shielding her from the painful stuff. “There’s no more cereal, so I have the last piece of toast. Luckily Mum isn’t hungry,” the girl says and you know the biggest thing Mum will have for breakfast is her own little white lie. When they reach the food bank, the child tucks into biscuits and squash while her mother sags like a balloon from which the air has escaped.Only just published, it is believed to be the UK’s first picture book about food banks. And, while the subject has been handled compassionately by the prize-winning author Kate Milner, I can’t help but see that landmark as a disgrace – for all of us. It is the watershed moment when Britain’s food banks go from newspaper headlines to a subject that teachers cover in classrooms the moment at which mass destitution is no longer a badge of political failure but is instead accepted as part of British life.As recently as 10 years ago, child poverty was an evil that prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown both vowed to abolish now it is something you shamefacedly explain to your child as he or she nestles in your lap.Picture books used to be small worlds where kids could dream about farmyard animals and cuddly monsters today they teach about the vast number of people that their parents’ generation treat like dirt. In 2016 David Cameron casually dropped the legally binding targets to reduce child poverty – and those figures jumped. More than 4 million children live in poverty in the UK today – or nine kids in every classroom of 30. At the start of this decade, the Trussell Trust ran just 57 food banks, giving 14,000 food parcels a year to children. It operated 428 food banks last year, handing nearly 580,000 parcels to children. This is a charity that sees itself as temporary. Our failure as a society is making it permanent.In one of the richest societies in human history, such figures should mortify us, yet the Westminster classes take them as unremarkable. They hardly ever trouble TV bulletins or newspaper columns, while Conservative cabinet ministers such as Michael Gove sneer at the impoverished for not being able to “manage their finances”.As the UK staggers into a rage-filled general election, well-lunched gasbags will solemnly inform us that this is an election about “getting Brexit done” – while ignoring the cuts, the broken economy and the other causes that helped to drive the Brexit vote of 2016. Dealing with those causes would entail being winched out of the deep embrace of the TV studio sofas, tearing out the IV drip that feeds them the untreated bullshit of No 10 “sources”, and seeing more of the country than could ever be conveyed in a fleeting vox pop.If the experts did that, they would confront a society where levels of deprivation once considered shameful are now treated as normal where what was scratched together just a few months ago is now relied on as part of the new, ad hoc welfare state.This week I went to Colchester, in Essex, to see something both brilliant and saddening: a Munch Club. In a small scout hut on the postwar Monkwick housing estate, 45 children and their parents were getting a free lunch to ease the expense of half-term holidays. Tiny kids were burrowing into mountains of chicken nuggets and chips before collecting chocolate cake in custard. There’ll be Munch Clubs across the town this week, run by volunteers and depending on donations. They’re the idea of Maureen Powell, a local pensioner with a sharp blond bob and a smoker’s laugh. She started here just a year ago, and by Christmas plans to run no fewer than six Munch Clubs. People keep asking her to lay on more, and she thinks she knows the number-one reason why.To keep the clubs going, Powell often raids her state pension while her small home is crammed with four freezers and three fridges to store supplies. As indicated by the crutch with which she hobbles, she has her own issues – arthritis, asthma and secondary multiple sclerosis. Let me speak plainly: Powell is a hero, yet nothing about this system feels like an adequate replacement for a proper welfare state. Except that’s not something the UK can say it really has any more – not when the state prefers literally to melt 50p pieces of hubris rather than keep citizens from starving.At one table sit Gary and Rebecca, surrounded by their five kids. She raises the children, while he stacks shelves at a supermarket. When his wages hit their bank account, the money is all gone on bills by that same afternoon. Their universal credit top-up is just not enough.If they weren’t at the Munch Club, “neither Gary nor me would eat anything till dinner, so as to leave more for the kids”, says Rebecca. How do they cope with the hunger? “You get used to it,” she shrugs.Their children get neither sweets nor treats, and their parents can’t afford to take them to Colchester zoo or the fireworks. I think about the classroom tradition of talking about what you did in your holidays and wonder what these kids say. I wonder how tough things get at home, and how much they overhear.Not far away is Bevan Close, a reminder of the Labour minister who built this estate. Nye Bevan wanted communities founded on fairness, where “the doctor, the grocer, the butcher and the farm labourer all live in the same street”. What has replaced his vision? When Cameron entered No 10, Colchester borough council received £11m a year from Whitehall. It’s a sum that has dropped and dropped: this year it is £275,000 next year, precisely zero. Common lawns on the estate used to get cut every month now it’s only three times a year.

The electorate has barely managed to press their noses against the glass and peer in: much of the Brexit debacle has unfolded out of sight and scrutiny. Instead, ever since Boris Johnson’s ascent to the premiership, the country has effectively been treated to a one-sided general election campaign the opposition has been all but squeezed out of media coverage. All of this now changes: the spectators can storm the stage.In the 00s, it was often claimed that political apathy had replaced political participation. Membership of political parties and electoral turnout were both said to be in irreversible decline. Who can bemoan the lack of political participation now? This is our age of mass politics: the Scottish independence movement, Farageism and Brexitism, a youth-led climate emergency movement, and Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour, which began as a husk and flowered into western Europe’s biggest political party. And it is this, in large part, that makes the election so unpredictable, so volatile. There is a politicised populace united around a single but fundamental point – desire for rupture with a status quo that never enjoyed enthusiastic support and now has lost popular acquiescence. If Johnson triumphs, his government will wrench Britain out of the EU with a deal that threatens to punch a hole the size of Wales in the economy, and use Brexit to remake British society in a hyper-Thatcherite mould. Labour’s mission, on the other hand, is to up-end a generation-long experiment in market fundamentalism and redistribute wealth and power away from its principal beneficiaries. Each represents an abandonment of the old order, even though the Tories’ version will benefit the vested interests who bankroll them.The Tories’ strategy is clear: use Brexit to torture Labour by iding its electoral coalition and drowning out its domestic agenda. Their secret weapons are Jo Swinson’s Liberal Democrats, who they hope will siphon enough votes from Labour to deliver scores of marginals to the Conservatives – even though Labour is now the only major party committed to a referendum with remain on the ballot paper. Most of the British press will act as Johnson’s cheerleaders, and the Tories’ traditional donors – hedge fund managers, financiers, magnates – will keep them flush with money.But it is mass politics that presents the party with a challenge. After MPs voted to approve a December election, the grassroots pro-Corbyn Momentum movement launched an appeal to raise £50,000 in 48 hours instead, it raised £100,000 in the first 12 hours, twice as much as in the same time period in 2017, and with an average donation of £24.40. It belies claims that enthusiasm for the Labour leadership has collapsed among a demoralised membership. And if that commitment to part with money is matched by a willingness to knock on doors, the party will be able to partly bypass an overwhelmingly hostile press and talk to voters one-on-one.It is mass politics, too, which challenges the Tories’ ability to monomaniacally focus on Brexit at the exclusion of all else. Polling shows that the environment has risen dramatically as a political priority for voters since January: a new poll finds that two-thirds of Britons believe the climate crisis is the biggest issue facing humanity, with more than half declaring that it would affect how they voted. This is, in part, down to protests by the Youth Strike 4 Climate and Extinction Rebellion. Labour’s radical policies for a Green New Deal – which link tackling the climate emergency to creating jobs, overhauling public transport and improving living standards – have yet to cut through. But in an election campaign, we can expect there to be an appetite to hear such proposals.But focusing on the misery of Tory Britain is a trap. Instead, Labour’s campaign should exude a relentless optimism: a sense that a nation this wealthy has the resources to overcome every injustice and challenge if the willpower is there. The age of mass politics is one that demands radical solutions rather than tinkering. Labour may begin the campaign with dire polling, but Tory despair under Theresa May has given away once again to hubris. The movements and struggles of the last decade have politicised millions to demand a breach with a failing social order. It is that resurgence of people power that Labour must tap into – and which Johnson’s Tories should surely fear."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5400d9ed7831812869a4ebd593d6241090a96811/0_354_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=03bb73919d1f7a662aafeea5a4820302","title":"voters not exhausted by politics they are eager to have their say in election","story":"Contrary to what Westminster seems to believe, the electorate has seldom been more engaged with political issuesIn politics, feelings are powerful. We are used to the idea that politicians can harness our anger, or our fear, to get us to believe certain things and behave in certain ways. But more and more, it is not our anger or fear that politicians appeal to, but our exhaustion.Exhaustion has become a rhetorical weapon for both sides of the Brexit ide: from some Brexiteers embracing the slogan “Bored of Brexit, Pass The Deal”, to the remainers claiming that only revoking article 50 will avoid years of wrangling over our new relationship with the EU. Equally, it is a political cudgel against MPs (remain or leave) who refuse to take an “easy” way out of Brexit, demanding more time for scrutiny of the deal, or a more careful, deliberative process for the public to have their say.This works because Westminster seems to believe it. For political journalists, “Brenda from Bristol” remains a symbol of the public mood – “I can’t stand this – there’s too much politics going on at the moment,” she said when Theresa May called a snap general election in 2017. Knocking on Brenda’s door has become a strange new ritual for political journalists whenever new elections are rumoured.But with yet another general election six weeks away, exhaustion does not capture how we really feel about politics. In fact, the era of “too much politics” – which began after the 2015 general election – has seen a heightened level of interest in politics, reversing a sharp decline in the early 2010s. According to the Hansard Society, Brexit and the recent wave of elections have acted as “electric shock therapy” for political engagement. Recent months have also revealed the public’s willingness to consume politics: viewing figures for BBC Parliament have spiked, especially during key moments in the Brexit process.Why, then, is Westminster so willing to believe that Brenda speaks for Britain? The first reason is that in recent years politicians and journalists have treated “apathy” as a key challenge to the political system in Britain. That began with the 2001 election and its very low turnout, and continued in 2015 with Russell Brand’s call for mass abstention. This way of thinking has dominated most political journalists’ careers, and has likely informed their view of how the average Briton feels about politics.The second is Westminster’s growing anxieties about its isolation from a “real Britain” outside London. Because national politics is so centred on the capital, political journalists fear that Westminster seems alien to the large majority who live beyond the M25. Giving prominence to the Brendas among us, then, is intended to show that political obsessives can understand how people feel outside the bubble. But in doing so it overcorrects, exaggerating public disengagement.The public, then, is still engaged with politics, and ready for whatever an election may bring. If anything keeps people away from the polls this winter, it’s more likely to be snow than “Brexhaustion”. Of course, we may eventually reach a point where political exhaustion does set in – but it may be that passions and fears over Brexit prevent that moment from ever arriving. At a time when the Brexit outcome has become so important to our political identities, can there ever really be “too much politics”? • Lawrence McKay is a PhD candidate in politics at the University of Manchester"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bb19ca0cd1d10a4f3448cbfabd9027871c7b48b/0_117_2897_1739/master/2897.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd7fb5956d560391c4f1e148f6fc94ac","title":"gdt european wildlife photographer of the year 2019 in pictures","story":"The Society of German Nature Photographers has chosen its winners and runners-up.

Halloween is huge. What was once a cobwebby half-term afterthought has reinvented itself. Olde-world graveyards and broomsticks have been ditched in favour of Instagrammable nail art and carefully curated pumpkin stalls.There are lots of reasons why Halloween is a really bad idea. It is the demon enabler of the evil sugar industry. It is an environmental disaster zone of disposable plastic tat – the charity Hubbub recently estimated that throwaway costumes and accessories generate polluting oil-based plastic equivalent to 83m plastic bottles. And, if that wasn’t bad enough, every year it completely spoils an entire week of Strictly Come Dancing with green body paint and coloured contact lenses. Yet, in the end, none of this matters, because Halloween is supposed to be nasty. The worse it gets, the better. Deal with it, because it is not going away.Halloween is scary, funny and probably bad for you. It is hypersexualised and narcissistic and all about how good you look. It is restless, always on the prowl for the most up-to-date joke, the newest hot take, the most zeitgeisty meme. In contrast to Christmas and Easter, which are convened around wholesome, home-cooked family feasts, Halloween catering is all about the sweets andor alcohol, depending on your age bracket. It rewards the skills of being good at putting on makeup, overthinking pop culture and having an encyclopedic knowledge of internet memes. And it looks great in photos. It is, in other words, the most 2019 party it is possible to imagine.While impressing your friends with your fabulous Christmas party dress is still cute, in a retro, early-00s-Richard-Curtis-movie kind of a way, it is your Halloween look that now wins the most points. Halloween is like the Met Gala, but everyone is invited. It requires wit as well as showmanship, gore as well as glamour. And it has to be rethought every year – sustainability red flag here, as discussed, but all the more reason to aim a bit higher than whatever crudely styled, statically charged tat you can get next-day-delivered on Amazon Prime. Read on for the looks that will make the cut this Halloween.The 31 October deadline will not come to pass, but the Halloween timing the PM repeated at every opportunity has fused the longest-running political horror show with the festival of terror and absurdity. Johnson – this year’s pop culture baddie – is the obvious look just rough up the Donald Trump wig from Halloween two years ago and add a bike helmet. But the Tim Burton vibes of Jacob Rees-Mogg also have potential. Maximum points to the person who figures out how to dress up as the Irish backstop. I have been working on a plan involving an Irish flag with a hard border, but I would be lying if I said I could explain it.“Avocado” was the word of the first half of this decade and “surreal” has been the word of the second half, a term that came into mainstream culture as politics became more and more absurd both here and in the US. Quirkily cartoonish takes on modern life are very Halloween 2019. Upcycle the papier mache art project that Year 3 made when they read James and the Giant Peach and combine with a model of the White House for a Dali-esque impeachment costume. Or team giant Chanel earrings, bronzer and false eyelashes with a Sherlock Holmes costume for a Coleen RooneyWagatha Christie look.No need for any of that goodwill-to-all-mankind, better-to-give-than-to-receive nonsense that you get at Christmas. Halloween is all about you. However, it is no longer socially acceptable to add “sexy” to a noun at random. A witch in a corset, a nurse in suspenders? Babes, the 20th century called – it needs its dressing-up box back. Instead, recruit a photogenic friend or family member and have them dress up as you. The Kardashian clan are, as ever, ahead of the curve here: three days before the date itself, one-year-old Stormi Webster, daughter of Kylie Jenner, was being proclaimed on social media as the “winner” of Halloween thanks to a bespoke outfit recreating her mum’s lilac feathered Versace Met Gala gown. Jessica Biel dressing as her husband Justin Timberlake (the ‘NSync era version) also podiums here. File under: because internet.It is like virtue-signalling, but without morals, and it is major. Obviously you have flawless taste, so this is your time to shine. Be the Hot Priest from Fleabag. (Also: so easy. Don’t forget the can of G\u0026ampT.) Or pay homage to Succession: is there anything scarier than Logan in a shawl-collar cable knit? Note: you can’t do Stranger Things – that was old last year.The late Karl Lagerfeld and his beloved kitten are the Gomez and Morticia of the 2019 Halloween circuit. For Karl, dust your hair with talcum powder, flip up the collar of your stiffest white shirt and pin in place with a fancy brooch. If you don’t have a brooch, one of those pearl hairclips that are everywhere and a couple of safety pins will do the trick. Add black shades, fingerless gloves, a fan and a can of Diet Coke. For Choupette, white cat ears and a mohair jumper should do it. If you are keen to show off your abs, there is always J-Lo in that green dress on the Versace catwalk. Or for insider fashion lolz, raid secondhand stores for a tweed suit and a boater hat and channel the gatecrasher who stormed the Chanel runway at Paris fashion week this month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb4228cbe7b2c054b50830b784808223f6539e34/0_1023_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fe7b8bb88086dc5ecfdf3dde73fed67e","title":"gorpcore why people who rarely go outside are wearing hiking gear","story":"A new retailer is coming to the UK, specialising in clothes for the urbanite who likes to look as if they’re off to the Himalayas. It’s the natural evolution of a baffling trendLove wearing a fleece but hate the thought of being five minutes away from a Starbucks? Prefer to observe your scenic views from the comfort of your computer? Then you will be into Snow Peak - the hipster Japanese outdoors shop that is coming to the UK. However, the clothes it sells are styled less for a leisurely ramble over a muddy munro and more for wearing in an ironically captioned selfie, looking a bit weather-worn.“I wanted to create clothes that are functional, practical but also stylish,” designer Lisa Yamai told Vogue. “I wanted to make outdoor clothes that you wouldn’t just wear at the weekend clothes you could wear seven days a week, that will make the outdoors feel more familiar.”Essentially, it is a very different look to the one you would pick up at your local branch of Blacks. Snow Peak is the natural destination for the urbanite who likes to wear a look that suggests they will be asking their nearest and dearest to sponsor a Himalayan hike very, very soon (but almost certainly not doing one).It sells elevated, high-fashion fishing vests, “outdoor kimonos” and, yes, lots of fleeces. Its aesthetic is very much where utility-wear is now – where luxury meets usefulness and functionality is the new decoration.Although the term was coined by The Cut in 2017, it still feels significant in the era of Generation Greta. It is a style that semaphores a healthy and clear objective. “Clothing that fits a purpose and does what it says will always be relevant to men,” Nick Paget, the senior menswear editor at trend-forecasting agency WGSN, said at the time.But like the power gilet in Succession, the look is also a humble power brag, a sartorial, ever-so-slightly judgey bit of virtue signalling: about being your most Bear Grylls-ish self.Think of the Jesus Is King-era Kanye West posing in the wilds of his Wyoming farm or Richard Madden on the cover of Interview magazine looking like he is just having a tea break after a spot of drywalling.A recent New York Times headline about warcore, the gorier sequel to gorpcore, squealed: “If you can get killed doing it, fashion wants it”.

Well it’s got one now, adapted by director Mike Flanagan from Stephen King’s 2013 followup novel. It is more than half an hour longer than the Stanley Kubrick film, although it seems more than that – laborious, directionless and densely populated with boring new characters among whom the narrative focus is muddled and split. Your attention is distracted from the central figure, who might otherwise have been an actual object of fascination: Danny Torrance, once the kid in the Overlook hotel, pedalling his trike around the eerily endless corridors and eventually pursued by his axe-wielding dad, unforgettably played by Jack Nicholson. The Kubrick movie, from 1980, famously disliked by King, is a stylistic influence on this sequel, which references the big moments. (King has an executive producer credit. So perhaps he came round to it.)Now Danny (forthrightly played by Ewan McGregor) is all grownup, unemployed, homeless, addled with alcoholism and post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the grisly finale in the snow at the end of the first story. His mum, Wendy, died not long after they moved away young Wendy is played in flashback by Alex Essoe. Adult Danny is still burdened with the telepathic power of “shining” (past tense “shined” not “shone”), but he has cultivated the art of shutting up his Overlook demons in imaginary boxes in his mind.After drifting, boozing and brawling from town to town, Danny finally goes into Alcoholics Anonymous. His fellow AA attendees find him a place to stay and a job as an orderly in a hospice, where he gets the fond nickname Doctor Sleep because of his telepathic empathy with those poor souls in extremis, gently shepherding them to the final slumber. Elsewhere, though, new supernatural forces both good and bad are on the march. A girl, wittily named Abra (Kyliegh Curran), has powers like Danny’s, and really needs his mentorship, like the guidance Danny once got from wise old Dick Hallorann (originally played by Scatman Crothers, here by Carl Lumbly). There is a sinister new evil band on the loose: a gang of vampiric parasites preying on children, led by a creepy hippyish figure called Rose the Hat (Rebecca Ferguson). They inhale the life-force “steam” from their horribly slaughtered young victims.The questions to ask about any Shining sequel obviously relate to the scariest thing in the first film: the hand-holding twins in the corridor. How about them? Could they somehow have grown up into ghostly adult twins now? Will they have an amusing and ingeniously conceived role to play in the sequel? Will Danny wind up getting off with one, without realising the other one’s hiding in the wardrobe? Well, I wish there were satisfying answers to these questions. Instead, the central evil role is disappointingly assigned to Rose the Hat, who just isn’t as scary or interesting.Eventually, after a long, long series of pointless narrative detours, we find ourselves back in the ruined Overlook hotel, and there’s a frisson there, undoubtedly – especially when we see the hole in the wall made by Torrance’s axe as he shouted “Heeeeere’s Johnny!” But it is almost cancelled out by the realisation that everything before it has been a bit redundant. Despite some big moments, this seems cumbersome and unnecessary: a dimming of the original.• Doctor Sleep is released in the UK on 31 October, in Australia on 7 Nov and in the US on 8 November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2983528c8dec3a4909a7c412d4acaebc744d201/0_1051_8550_5128/master/8550.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c8a4a8fe49627de6ae67f0d125556b8","title":"how to make the perfect scouse stew hotpot recipe felicity cloake","story":"This meat-and-potato stew from Liverpool has versions throughout northern Europe, and not even Scousers agree what the best recipe is, but our resident culinary perfectionist won’t let that stop her ...Scouse is a dish so close to the Liverpudlian heart that they’ve adopted it as a nickname – though lobscouse, or lapskaus, lapskojs or skipperlabskovs, depending where you are, is a popular dish throughout northern Europe, thought to have its origins in the simple cooking of Hanseatic sailors, and with even more variants than names. In Germany, for example, labskaus is more like corned beef hash, while in Norway, lapskaus is a chunky stew much like our own.Unsurprisingly, given the geography of the area, Liverpool’s scouse isn’t dissimilar to Irish stew or Lancashire hotpot, either, and, like those noble dishes, is eminently practical, easy to make in a small kitchen, or indeed a galley, and to adapt to current circumstances – there’s even a vegetarian variant, blind scouse, for when you can’t, or won’t, run to meat. But while Scousers are united on its virtues, as with all such beloved local specialities, passions run high when it comes to the finer details. Beef or lamb, mince or meat, carrots or swede … wish me luck, I’m going in.I, however, confine myself to the fresh kind, in this instance: chuck steak for the “world’s best scouse” (their words, not mine) as served in Liverpool FC’s cafe minced beef as used by Maggie May’s, a place that get quite a lot of love from scouse aficionados online, and in a family recipe posted online lamb shoulder and kidney in Simon Rimmer’s version and lamb neck on the bone for Paul Hollywood’s scouse pie.Perhaps unsurprisingly, they all give very different results: mince is handy if time is of the essence, but proves less satisfying to eat than larger chunks of meat, not least because it disappears into the gravy after an hour or so on the hob.I’ve also chosen to brown the meat in dripping, because it feels right here failing that, a neutral oil, or a mixture of oil and butter, as Rimmer suggests, will do fine. Hollywood’s olive oil, however, tastes a bit weird.You don’t, of course, have to use any meat at all: when you couldn’t quite run to any, you’d make the aforementioned “blind scouse” instead – often with bones, but you could use vegetable stock, or try the Quorn and sweet potato version in the Merseysider magazine.Either way, this is a dish that’s packed full of vegetables: onion is a must, and everyone but Webster’s Encyclopaedia adds carrot, too. Hollywood also sticks in swede, which ides opinion I happen to think that the sweetness works well with lamb, but if you’re not a fan, feel free to use more carrot in its place.Most important, however, are the spuds. You can go fancy, as Rimmer does, and use them to line the dish, finishing with a crisp potato top reminiscent of a Lancashire hotpot, but we decide it’s far more comforting to cook them until they break down to thicken the gravy, as in Webster’s version. That said, a few fluffy chunks are also welcome to help soak up the sauce, so I’m going to add spuds in two stages: the first peeled and cut small to facilitate their dissolution, the second with the skins left on to help keep the cubes together.Either make the stock yourself, as in Webster’s recipe, or use ready-made beef stock seems to be the name of the game, with Oxo cubes and gravy salts mentioned specifically by several correspondents. Liverpool FC starts its gravy with bitter ale, reduced by half, giving the scouse a robustly fruity, hoppy flavour delicious, but if it ain’t broke … though I will allow for a dash of Worcestershire sauce, because lots of people tell me their mum uses it, so it must be OK.As with most stews, the longer the cooking, the better – I prefer to do mine in a moderate oven, to keep the temperature fairly constant, though the hob works just fine, if you prefer. Once the meat is falling off the bone, you can cool it and skim the fat off the top, if you like, or do as Hollywood suggests and cover it in puff pastry and turn your scouse into a pie.Personally, I prefer to eat it straight away, with a generous helping of pickled cabbage on the side (beetroot is also acceptable, and I reckon it would also be nice with steamed greens, but I need to check that with a scouser before I try).800g scrag endlamb neck, on the bone, in thick slices, or 600g boneless lamb shoulder2 tbsp beef dripping or neutral oil500g floury potatoes, cleaned2 onions600ml beef stock2 sprigs fresh thyme1 bay leaf2 carrots250g swede (optional)Salt and pepperWorcestershire sauce, to tasteHeat the oven to 160C (140C fan)320Fgas 3 alternatively, cook this on the hob. Heat the fat in a large, lidded saucepan or ovenproof pan over a medium-high heat, then sear the meat in batches, until properly browned.Lift out and set aside. Meanwhile, peel half the potatoes and cut into small cubes, setting the rest aside for the time being, and peel and thinly slice the onions.Turn down the heat, add the onions and fry, stirring regularly, until soft.Now add the cubed potatoes, fry for five minutes more, then stir in the stock, scraping the bits off the bottom of the pan as you do so, and return the meat to the pot along with the herbs.Bring to a simmer, then cover and put in the oven (or leave on a low heat) for 60 minutes, until the potatoes have begun to dissolve into the sauce. Mash a few of them against the sides of the pot to help them along.Meanwhile, peel and cube the carrots and swede, if using, and dice the remaining potatoes – there’s no need to peel them.After the scouse has been cooking for 60 minutes, add the vegetables to the pot and return to the oven (or hob) for another hour, or until the vegetables are tender.Season to taste with salt, pepper and a dash of Worcestershire sauce, and serve hot with pickled cabbage or beetroot.• Scouse or lobbies, beef or lamb – or neither?

Stir the gel food dye into each bowl until evenly distributed.For the pumpkins, slip a piping nozzle with lots of open teeth into your piping bag before spooning in orange-coloured meringue. When you pipe, it will look like the ridges on a pumpkin. Pipe a small amount of green meringue for the stalk (just snip the end of a piping bag for this). For the ghosts, fill a piping bag with white meringue (you can use other colours, too), cut a medium tip and pipe meringue kisses. You can also use your fingers to pinch the sides to create little arms, or pipe on little arms. For the tall ghosts with a rippled effect, alternate between squeezing and stopping squeezing your piping bag while working your way upwards. Play about with other shapes and effects.Bake for 45-60min at 120C (100C fan)250Fgas mark ½ for meringues that are gooey in the centre. For completely crisp and dry meringues, bake for 1hr 30min and then switch off the oven and leave the oven door closed for a few hours.To decorate, use red gel food dye for blood (you can thin this with a little water) and black gel food dye for other details. Use edible glue to stick on edible eyes and sprinkles (eg bones)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/493d45f9977076fd2d7262e376bfd40ebc456295/548_758_4386_2632/master/4386.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f628f4e0223685f78a899afb43dcc271","title":"winter weight why our hunger is rising rapidly and how to sate it","story":"As the sunlight recedes and your body tries to compensate with food, it’s time to break out the stews and soupsI once did an idle poll of all the ways people’s mothers had called them fat and my favourite … well, it was a joint three-way between: “You could eat one more potato than a pig”, “Your brother is slimmer and more handsome, but that’s made him arrogant” and “Darling, you’re at what I would call your winter weight.” Ah, winter weight: is it a real thing or just a caustic critique? It’s both.Some people don’t get hungrier when the seasons change and think it’s one of those things that happens to women, and bears. Those people are the outliers they just don’t know it. A drop in ambient temperature increases energy expenditure in both sexes (also in bears). It shouldn’t matter enormously on a basic calories-in-calories-out model, because we’re talking just 150 calories a day. You use extra energy, you eat a banana this is the smallest inconvenience the change in seasons has to offer, less annoying than having to find your cagoule. However, the human body being somewhat more complicated than a basic book-keeping system, all your appetite hears is the activation. It’s like the Hulk. It doesn’t want to do just one job. It’s a force of nature, not a supplier of goods and services. It wants to burst out of its clothes and keep on going until you, too, have burst out of your clothes.There’s also a serotonin angle, as the sunlight recedes and your hormonal pathways try to source joy from other places, at which point a banana won’t cut it. And then, of course, there’s a feedback loop. You start by craving refined carbohydrates for a reason, but then you want more cake because you just had cake, as with heroin.There’s a strong argument that says: who cares? Be your winter weight. And, sod it, while you’re there, why not eat one more potato than a pig? But let’s say you’re one of those people who hates being at the mercy of uncontrollable forces under the skin. There are things to eat in winter that don’t come from Greggs.The point isn’t that you should eat hot food because it increases your body temperature from the inside. It doesn’t create a little pocket of heat in your stomach that emanates to your extremities for the rest of the day – it’s food, not uranium the Ready Brek ad was basically mis-selling. But complex carbohydrates take more energy to digest, so will be both satiating and warming, which leads inexorably to the stew or hearty soup.I start with pearl barley. I’m always bored with it by Christmas and by June I’ve forgotten how to cook it (it’s easy, like rice, only takes four times as long), but in the first cold snap it is powerfully cheering and fills your kitchen with a delicious, heady smell, as if you were living in a 16th-century brewery and will be ready for a massive knees-up in six months’ time. Delia Smith’s One Is Fun – perhaps the most controversial work in her canon, having caused lifelong rifts since the 1980s as friends presented it to each other as a passive-aggressive gift item (“You’re going to be alone for ever, at least eat nice soup”) – has a pearl barley soup of such substance, such rough but pleasing texture (squishy no, wait, chewy no, wait, slightly sticky ah, hang on, also crunchy) and such an ancient vibe – you can taste the centuries of embedded knowledge, one generation passing carrot-wisdom on to the next, back into the mists of time – that while you’re on the first bowl, you feel as though you could eat it every day, for every meal, for ever. This will, unfortunately, turn out not to be true.I don’t want to bang on about meat, painfully aware of how often I’ve claimed to be nearly vegan and then had a salt-beef sandwich. But the classic stew is barley with lamb, and William Drabble’s recipe is as close to perfect as it gets.This will all take a lot longer than pasta and someone is sure to bang on about their slow cooker, and how it revolutionised their lives, because suddenly they were chopping onions at 7.25 in the morning and coming home to a delicious meal of very intense onions. I find this a slightly saddening life fix because part of the pleasure of making a stew is feeling that it was your skill – browning it, poking it, going back to have a look at it – that brought it to that point of excellence. Also, all those delicious smells, like a full-house scented candle made of food, except not £65 (there is no stew as expensive as a candle, except cassoulet). It’s better to make it on a Sunday and eat it all week. When you feel the painful monotony on around Thursday, you can add aioli."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ed8cbae8fd9115ddceaed75f83221b5b83d90b2/0_0_7111_4267/master/7111.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=de1a32c72e1a437aba540bae9557bce2","title":"yam dunk how we fell in love with sweet potatoes","story":"Britons prefer them to traditional tatties, but we’ve hardly begun to plumb their tender depths – there’s much more to them than fancy chips or Thanksgiving pieHere’s a seasonal question for you. When James Taylor sat down to write about the childhood sweetheart who had finally agreed to be his girl, which vegetable metaphor did he plump for?The sweet potato. That’s right. “Oh Lord, I feel fine today,” he crooned on his 1988 album Never Die Young. “I’m walking on cloud nine today …”Why, you ask. “I’m prepared to tell you why,” he replies. “It’s strictly on account of my sweet potato pie.”Although few women would be delighted to be compared, however loosely, to a dish made with starchy tubers, Taylor does a decent job of selling it, and its main ingredient. It is tender, he says, it’s sweet, it’s soft and deep it’s soulful.If you’ve ever had a slow-roasted batch of this succulent vegetable, you’ll know he’s right. Sweet potatoes – now at the peak of their season – are the business.They are also big business. Over the past decade, according to Kantar Worldpanel, demand for sweet potatoes in the UK has quadrupled. For a while, they mostly came from warmer climes – North Carolina, Israel – but in 2015, farmers in Kent pulled out all the stops to put a UK-grown crop in the supermarkets. That same year, the Office for National Statistics included the sweet potato in the illustrative shopping basket it uses to measure inflation. And last year, consumer research showed most people would opt for a sweet potato side dish over a straight-up potato one. Yet most of us have only begun to plumb those tender, sweet, soulful depths.First up, sweet potatoes don’t have to be orange. Those Kentish farmers chose to cultivate the familiar red-skinned, flame-fleshed variety, often known as yams in the southern US. But if you have a Caribbean market stall or an Asian grocer nearby, you can probably get hold of something different. There are purple sweet potatoes, white sweet potatoes, yellow sweet potatoes. With the variations in colour come differences in texture, density, flavour and uses. The food website Saveur has a tantalising guide to 16 kinds, from the tan-skinned hannah, which bakes into a soft, dry yellow, perfect for mashing, to korean purple, with its white flesh and magenta exterior yielding a subtle chestnut flavour. If you can, try them all.Sweet potato fries or baked wedges are, it would appear, the thing that has pushed the root veg into the mainstream. And it is hard to argue with them. The food writer Anna Jones recommends coating wedges in polenta before baking – it crisps them up nicely. She serves hers with a chipotle yoghurt dipping sauce. If you want to deep-fry yours, Felicity Cloake cautions that they are best thick-cut, par-boiled (with a little bicarb) and coated in a cornflour paste (she spikes hers with paprika), then rolled in cornmeal.There is, however, more to sweet potatoes than chips. The Mississippi-born chef Brad McDonald, in his book Deep South, does a smoked pork belly served with a spiced sweet potato casserole topped with pecan praline and Italian meringue. Yotam Ottolenghi mixes them, roasted, with pickled onion, coriander and goat’s cheese as an accompaniment to fish or chicken. Vegans and “clean-eaters”, meanwhile, routinely tout the virtues of the sweet potato just as much as any meat eater.Depending, of course, on what you load them up with, sweet potatoes are a healthier option than conventional potatoes. They are lower in carbohydrates and calories, and higher in fibre and vitamin A. Their sweetness marries with a host of aromatics – from paprika to cinnamon, thyme to cumin and coriander. And their creaminess suggests all manner of pairings: sour cream, salsa verde, miso, chilli. Nigel Slater steams slices to make a fragrant split orange lentil dal that he serves with fresh coriander. And Melissa Hemsley uses chunks as the base for a lemongrass-infused chickpea and coconut curry. Sweet potatoes also make an excellent starting point for a soup, a stew, a bake or a pie.The traditional sweet potato pie – a Thanksgiving classic – is made with butter, flavoured with vanilla and cinnamon, encased in shortcrust and served with whipped cream. Deb Perelman of the Smitten Kitchen blog went through a southern food infatuation, as she put it, a few years back, but hankered after something a little lighter for afters. She found it in the Lee Brothers’ buttermilk sweet potato pie – more cheesecake than stodge.Tanya Harris, of the My Forking Life blog, does a mean vegan take on the trad Jamaican sweet potato pudding using coconut milk, brown sugar and allspice, but forgoing the rum you would find in other recipes. Jamaican sweet potatoes are of the denser kind, meaning the pudding is more cake-like. But even if you only have orange jewel sweet potatoes and have to spoon the resulting bake into a bowl, it will still be delicious.Then there are the many Japanese sweets to be made with the vegetable. The most popular is a double-baked beauty: sweet potato puree with butter, sugar, cream and egg. A scattering of black sesame seeds on top, and you’re golden.Mostly though, it’s best to remember that the sweet potato doesn’t need much doing to it to be perfect. It is one of those culinary failsafes, a foil to every kitchen foible. There are vendors in Japan who park vans on street corners and belt out: “Ishi yaki imo”, which means stone-baked sweet potato. That is all they are selling. One bite of the piping-hot tat wrapped in newspaper and you’re sold. You’re going home to rustle up more of the same in a hot, hot oven. Slow-roasting the potato in its skin means the moisture is retained and the sugars in the skin caramelise. As savoury as it is sweet, this is a whole warming meal for cold hands on a winter’s day. And that’s something to sing about."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/568cbf241fb8dfd043cfd0d553534e28c5074418/596_908_3965_2379/master/3965.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41e65f49aded9ced461375b9fbcc412b","title":"the fiver arsenal granit xhaka","story":"Sign up now!

According to Unai Emery, Granit Xhaka is still feeling “devastated and sad” about being jeered off by Arsenal fans during Sunday’s 2-2 draw against Crystal Palace. We know a thing or two about being told we’re useless at our job, you see. Each weekday at around 5.10pm we step outside Fiver Towers and clear up all the rotten fruit that’s been hurled our way after our latest attempt at tea-timely humour has been received about as well as news of another general election reaching Brenda from Bristol. Like a Xhaka lunge that results in a card, we too feel devastated and sad that the intention behind our energetic attempt at winning back the hearts and minds of our followers has been hopelessly misunderstood.Emery is of the opinion that Xhaka should say sorry to fans for telling them where to beeping go before hurling his shirt at the ground. “I think when we make inidual mistakes we need to make apologies,” Emery blabbed of Xhaka’s fresh and funky departure. “We suggest to him to do it.” The Fiver would suggest he doesn’t do it in a hurry. On top of being given verbal pelters for his perceived on-pitch failings, he’s had to soak up a shed-load of filth directed at him and his partner on various social media disgraces recently, too. Oh, and he became a father four weeks ago. If certain entitled fans can’t understand why the poor chap might have been at breaking point on Sunday, they ought to poke themselves in their eyes to see if they can actually feel anything. Xhaka has since deleted a picture of himself on Instachat wearing the Arsenal captain’s armband and replaced it with a Switzerland one instead. With fans such as these, it’s a crying shame anyone has to captain Arsenal – but someone does.So step forward leader of men Mesut Özil, who has been located in an Emirates Stadium storeroom and dusted off just in time to be fitted for the Coca-Cola Cup armband he is likely to wear at Anfield on Wednesday evening against Liverpool U-16s. Xhaka has not been included in Arsenal’s matchday squad so that he can continue to let steam out of his ears. It’s a tricky one for Emery, who needs some kind of response from his side to help shift the dark cloud that’s been following him around for the past few weeks, even if he names a reserve XI including Gunnersaurus, Fiver Jr and Troopz from AFTV.It’s a free hit for Jürgen Klopp, though, who will give teenage man-bun extraordinaire Harvey Elliott another chance to become Liverpool’s youngest ever goalscorer. The 16-year-old is back in contention after serving a 14-day domestic ban for being idiotic and mocking Harry Kane with offensive language. Chelsea and Manchester United also play in the Rumbelows Cup at Stamford Bridge, with Frank Lampard’s Chelsea manager Frank Lampard expected to stick to his policy of playing only footballers who are young enough to know what the Fortnite dance is. As for Xhaka, maybe he should spend his night off in the away end at Anfield, where he can see if any disgruntled Gooners would like to share their views about him in person.Join Gregg Bakowski from 7.30pm for hot MBM coverage of Liverpool 3-1 Arsenal, while Rob Smyth will be on hand at 8.05pm for Chelsea 1-2 Manchester United.“What kind of sick, twisted, immoral creature would put milk, milk, in a SodaStream (yesterday’s Fiver)?” – Ferg Slade.“Dale Chase (yesterday’s Fiver letters) urges The Fiver to turn from its Stop Football campaign to Stop VAR.

Tommy is the child of Mike Doyle’s son Scott and Pardoe’s daughter Charlotte, who met as toddlers when their fathers were City teammates.Doyle senior, who died in 2011 aged 64, played 570 times in the Maine Road defence, winning the league title in the 1967-68 season and five England caps. Pardoe, meanwhile, made 380 City appearances as first a centre forward, then at full-back, infamously breaking a leg tackling George Best in 1970.Their grandson may have stayed largely under the radar – until now – but regular watchers of City youth games have persistently likened him to a young Steven Gerrard. Two-footed and blessed with near-perfect balance and an exemplary attitude, Doyle reads the game well, sees a pass before many teammates and has captained junior sides for both City and England.Before the Southampton game he sought counsel from Pardoe. “I spoke to my grandad Glyn,” said Doyle. “He said: ‘Just go out and do what you do.’ I went out and did the best I can. Hopefully Mike is watching down and is proud of me, I’ve done it for him as well.”During the game a banner in the stands in tribute to Mike caught his eye. “I’ve seen it before and it just makes me feel proud,” he said. “For me to continue the Doyle legacy in a different era is a massive thing. Since he died I’ve always wanted to make him proud so I’ll keep my head down, listen to all the information I can get and see how far I can go.Even so he still has to pinch himself when he creates chances for Sergio Agüero, a striker he was recently cheering on from the popular seats. “I’m giving passes to Sergio and it doesn’t seem real. He gives you a lot of information but keeps it fun, keeps it happy. He’s always laughing and joking which helps calm you down, make you feel better. To be playing with him is amazing.”Foden, too, has offered invaluable help. “I had a chat with Phil a couple of days ago in training and he just told me to play my normal game. I need to keep listening to him.”Pardoe could not resist reminding his grandson that he made his debut at an even earlier age. “I FaceTimed him before the game, and told him I couldn’t wait,” said Doyle. “He reminded me he was only 15, just getting a little dig in! But he’s a legend at this club so I’m fortunate to get advice others might not have.”Not to mention inspiration. “My dad has videos and stuff, so I’ve seen my granddad Mike do a few crazy things, and Glyn be pretty normal! I have their shirts at home, some of them in my room, and sometimes I just look at them, to remember …”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/783587464cc6b32f9900e67fffe65c51b45ca0cd/48_0_1440_864/master/1440.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7156cbb7866f0f9b97d412510b77791","title":"counter strike trading found to be nearly all money laundering","story":"Valve says it has halted trading of some in-game items in multiplayer shooterThe gaming firm Valve has halted trading of some in-game items in its popular multiplayer shooter Counter-Strike: Global Offensive after discovering that “nearly all” of the trading was part of a money-laundering scheme run by “worldwide fraud networks”.In CS:GO, players can earn containers with cosmetic items, which can be unlocked using keys bought either in-game or for real money from other players.Valve said it had closed the market between players, and in patch notes for the latest version of CS:GO – first reported by Motherboard – it gave its reasons.“In the past, most key trades we observed were between legitimate customers. However, worldwide fraud networks have recently shifted to using CS:GO keys to liquidate their gains,” it said. “At this point, nearly all key purchases that end up being traded or sold on the marketplace are believed to be fraud-sourced. As a result we have decided that newly purchased keys will not be tradeable or marketable.”Valve did not go into detail, but it is likely the trading was used to launder income from credit card fraud and other financial crimes. Buying and reselling digital goods is a popular way for financial criminals to cash out from identity theft. In the past, iTunes and Amazon gift cards have also been popular.Counter-Strike has previously faced criticism from regulators for enabling gambling by children. In July the Gambling Commission’s programme director, Brad Enright, told MPs that CS:GO was responsible for more enquiries than any other game. “We’ve had dialogue with Valve Corporation,” Enright said. “Where we draw their attention to particular games where British consumers including children are gambling on those sites, they have closed them down.“We’ve said that’s not a sustainable approach. They’ve created this situation … and there’s an onus and responsibility on them to address the byproduct of how they’re operating.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20d83d6a11c254b7a88c3d6a0844ab1c4e7e9d3b/0_214_4200_2520/master/4200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49ced80a739757522d1c73c3a8b8477f","title":"mozhdah jamalzadah afghanistan oprah winfrey","story":"The presenter, pop star and women’s rights activist Mozhdah Jamalzadah talks about fleeing her country, before returning and revolutionising Afghan TVOne Friday, after the taping of her Afghan television chatshow, a woman from the studio audience came up to Mozhdah Jamalzadah to hug her. “She was so emotional and she wouldn’t let go,” says Jamalzadah. The woman said Jamalzadah’s programme, The Mozhdah Show, had stopped her husband beating their children, after it covered corporal punishment. “But from her face, I could tell that there was more to it,” says the 37-year-old. “I’m thinking that maybe he stopped beating her, too. That made me very emotional, and she just kept repeating: ‘We need you, Afghanistan needs you.’”Jamalzadah was five when her family escaped Afghanistan, eventually settling in Canada. In 2009, in her mid-20s, she returned to Kabul after being invited by a new TV station to host a talent show. She had started singing a few years earlier, posting music videos on YouTube one song, Afghan Girl, had become a hit in her homeland (she would be invited to perform it in 2010 at the White House to mark International Women’s Day in front of the Obamas).She and her mother, Nasrin, travelled to Kabul. But unbeknown to Jamalzadah, Nasrin had no intention of letting her daughter present a mere talent show. Instead she had packed several DVDs of The Oprah Winfrey Show – which they had been watching for years in Nasrin’s hair salon in Vancouver – and during their first meeting with TV executives, she pitched The Mozhdah Show. Not just a chatshow, either, but a vehicle, modelled on Oprah, to change the lives of Afghan women. The TV station went for it – and it ran from 2009 to 2011. For a country reeling from years of war, followed by the harsh Taliban rule, Jamalzadah became an image of what a modern Afghan woman could be – and there were many people in the country of her birth who didn’t like it.Jamalzadah speaks by Skype from Toronto, where she is promoting a film, Red Snow. In it, she plays the educated daughter of an Afghan family who help a First Nations Gwich’in soldier in the Canadian army, who is captured by the Taliban. A biography of Jamalzadah is also just about to be published. In the film, she wears a blue burqa – it’s the same garment Nasrin wore, hoping to pass as a peasant, when they fled Kabul about 30 years earlier, making a perilous journey to Pakistan. Her father, Bashir, had been a teacher when word got to him that he was about to be arrested because he was suspected of opposing the Soviet-backed government. The Jamalzadahs – Nasrin and Bashir, Mozhda and her two younger brothers, one of whom was only six months old – fled. “I was well aware that there was a major possibility we might not make it,” she says. “My heart would beat every time a soldier would hop up on the bus, and I would think: ‘I hope they don’t find out we’re city people.’”They were granted asylum in Canada and moved to Ontario. Jamalzadah remembers the cold, mostly, and, while she made good friends, she also experienced overt racism. Yet, she says: “At the same time, I knew we were safe, and I didn’t have to worry about whether my family were going to be OK. In Afghanistan I had rockets firing over my head and didn’t know where they were going to land. I would be out in the yard playing with my cousin, and you could hear the rockets. The racism and all the other stuff didn’t compare to trying to survive.”The family settled in Vancouver, where Bashir opened a pizza restaurant and Nasrin a hair salon. As a teenager, Jamalzadah became obsessed with reports about the war in Afghanistan, searching online and watching the news as soon as she was home from school. “I wanted to know how my family was, because there was no phone, no contact. I would think the worst when the bombings were happening, right after 911.”Her parents had urged her not to take opportunities and freedoms for granted, and she didn’t, but it also made her feel guilty that she was living such a different life to the friends she had left in Afghanistan. “My parents wanted me to use all of it fully so they were constantly reminding me how lucky I was. But, constantly being reminded, I was becoming more and more depressed. While all my other friends were talking about shopping and boys they had crushes on, secretly, this was my torment. I was constantly looking for ways to do something to help and speak up for those people.”She had been writing poetry and realised that while she could never remember the words of political speeches, she always remembered song lyrics. So one day she told her mother she’d like to find someone to turn her poems into songs. Nasrin encouraged her to have singing lessons with the Afghan-Canadian musician Wahid Omid. He uploaded one song to YouTube and it went viral.“I think people were hungry for something new, different. I was a girl and after the war there were hardly any female singers, especially ones who pranced around in the outfits I did.” The online attacks soon started, and Jamalzadah says she almost gave up, but she realised that was what the trolls wanted. Her next song, Dukhtare Afghan (Afghan Girl), written about an acid attack on girls going to school, was played on Afghan radio and became a hit, bringing her to the attention of TV executives.Being in Kabul, she says, “was magical. I mean, there’s barbed wire, dust everywhere, it’s a war zone, but I was totally OK with that because I was around Afghan people, and they seemed exactly the way that they were before. The love and the hospitality, and everything that Afghans stand for, was still there.”She laughs now too at how naive she was. Once she thought she heard a door slam and someone at her guesthouse told her it was a bomb. Another time, she thought she heard fireworks, only for the CEO of the TV station to shout at her not to leave the building: “You’re going to get hit by a bullet: do you not hear what’s going on out there?” “So it was comical, but very dark,” she says. In 2009: “There were times where everything felt like it was OK, other than the few suicide bombings here and there – everyone was just out and about, there were restaurants, everything was lively, and I loved it.”“That’s when we started receiving threats,” she says. Did she feel unsafe? “If I constantly lived in fear, it would stop me from doing anything, so I stopped myself from thinking about it.”She thinks her experience as a child, “not knowing if I’m going to live or not, affected me – it’s normal for me. I’d rather live a shorter life and have it be more impactful and live it to the fullest, then have a long one living in fear, afraid to go out and do something because I might get killed.”She was, she admits, protected to some degree by her Canadian citizenship. One girl, a contestant on a TV talent show, Afghan Star, that Jamalzadah presented from 2012 to 2013, told her: “If I had a foreign passport, I would dress like you. You can go back to Canada, but I can’t. I’m stuck here.” “She was right. I could see that in the way that I was treated. I’m sure that there were lots of people who would have liked to do all kinds of things but couldn’t get away with it. I think my fear was lessened because at any point, I could go to the Canadian embassy and be protected.”It couldn’t, however, protect her from a horrific attack by a man who she says assumed, because she was westernised, that she would be open to a sexual relationship. She alleges he lured her to an empty nightclub, then attacked her violently and she only got away after threatening him with a gun she kept in her bag. “The attack that happened to me happens to girls constantly, and there is nothing they can do. Even I couldn’t do anything,” she says. She wanted to report it, “but as a woman there, you’re pretty much voiceless. Maybe I can’t do anything in Afghanistan, but I can in Canada. I can’t report it there, but I told my story.”In 2011, flying back to Kabul after a break in Canada, the Canadian embassy got in touch with her en route and told her there had been a serious threat, and that she should turn back. She ignored the warning, but in Kabul, her TV colleagues said the same thing and told her they were taking the show off-air.“It was devastating,” she says. “I felt defeated. When you’re on this high and think, ‘I’m making a difference’, then all of a sudden, all of that is shattered. I felt like a complete failure.”She returned to Canada wanting to give up. “I was like ‘it’s over. How stupid was I to think that I could make a difference?’ Then slowly I had to get myself out of that darkness and, and realise, no, I can’t let them defeat me.” She started thinking: “I could do so much more from here, and it doesn’t have to be The Mozhdah Show.”She has a strong social media presence in Afghanistan, where she is both supported and attacked for her posts. She sings in English, as well as in Farsi, and hopes to cross over to a bigger western audience. “I know it’s going to be a lot of work, but I have to do it. My goal is to be a women’s rights activist in the world,” she says. “I have to work to get myself to a position where I can speak for women who don’t have a voice, on a much bigger scale. That’s my goal now.”• Voice of Rebellion, the biography of Mozhdah Jamalzadah, is out on 7 November"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/818ee76c533e541ca8392075e12d69eacc76431b/0_989_3912_2347/master/3912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c76564dff25e47c31ae127286903a357","title":"what are your views on modern masculinity","story":"For our second series about modern masculinity, we’d like to hear men’s views on fatherhood and getting older Earlier in the year we did a call out to  readers asking for your views on the issues affecting men which helped guide a series looking at modern masculinity in 2019.Your responses led us to address questions around role models, intergenerational relationships and even the popularity of Jordan Peterson, and we want to return with a second series, led by you, looking deeper into the areas that you want to see us addressing.We know about some of the issues that men are interested in discussing such as pornography, fatherhood and getting older, so we want to hear your views on those topics but we’d also like you to tell us what we should cover in the next series too.You can share your views in the encrypted form below, anonymously if you prefer.

She also claims that when she raised salary concerns with management she was told by a senior BBC executive that “the BBC doesn’t do equal pay”.Ahmed said she had more input into writing her programme’s scripts than Vine and also highlighted the extra demands placed on female presenters: “It is likely that Jeremy Vine spends less time in make-up than I do. Women are more likely to be criticised for their appearance on air.”The broadcaster arrived at the central London tribunal to give evidence on Wednesday accompanied by supporters including fellow BBC presenters Jane Garvey, Richard Coles and Aasmah Mir, in the first major employment tribunal case since the corporation become embroiled in the gender pay row.Ahmed is bringing the case against the BBC on the basis that she was paid £440 an episode for presenting Newswatch since 2012, at a time when her male equivalent at the broadcaster, Vine, was paid £3,000 an episode for presenting Points of View. Both are short television programmes of similar length that deal with viewer feedback about BBC output, with Ahmed claiming the pay difference is an example of gender discrimination.She said there was little logic to how the BBC paid its top talent: “It seems to me that men are more likely to be seen as stars, or at least stars that should be paid very highly. I don’t think it is clear what criteria the BBC use to decide whether someone is a star.”In supporting documents, she said she had been brought in to “transform the look and ambition” of Newswatch following the departure of its previous host Raymond Snoddy, but was kept on a similar salary.As part of her case, Ahmed’s team have said Newswatch attracts about 1.6 million combined viewers across the BBC News channel and BBC One – more than double that of Points of View.In response, the BBC has taken the unusual decision to play down the reach of its own output, saying its rolling news channel is a “relatively niche” service that airs little-watched programmes. It also said the only reason the corporation repeated the Newswatch programme on BBC One on a Saturday morning was to “fill out the programme at the weekend”, suggesting it was only watched because viewers had already turned on their TV in the hope of seeing BBC Breakfast.The BBC’s initial evidence at the tribunal claimed the two viewer feedback programmes were different shows for different audiences, which justified the different salaries paid to their presenters. The corporation claims Points of View is an entertainment show which has always attracted high-paid, high-profile presenters who have the skills to deal with a topic in a “light-hearted way”. By contrast, Newswatch is a “serious programme, which deals with matters seriously”, presented by a news journalist, which means it has always commanded a much lower salary.The broadcaster said Vine earned substantially more because of his star status across the broadcaster’s output, having negotiated a bumper pay contract in early 2008 when an unnamed commercial broadcaster was offering the Eggheads host a salary of about £1m to leave the BBC.Vine stopped presenting Points of View last year and was replaced by Tina Daheley, who receives £400 an episode for providing a voiceover. Ahmed will claim that the decision to cut the presenting fee for Points of View is related to her employment tribunal claim.However, the broadcaster has chosen to contest her claims over Newswatch, which could result in her winning more than half a million pounds in back pay.Equal pay is different to the wider issue of the gender pay gap. It covers specific cases where iniduals doing the same, or equivalent, work are paid less than their colleagues."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a03050098d6c4377239f446f238df0b980cbddd9/0_32_4044_2426/master/4044.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87ddb1d7dea55033e07fb3b60527776b","title":"damian carrington on 10 years as the guardians environment editor","story":"One of our leading environment journalists reflects on how awareness of the climate crisis has shifted in the last decade and offers advice for those who want to do moreWhat did you do before you joined the ?I did a PhD and post-doc research in geology at Edinburgh University, including an expedition to Antarctica, which was amazing: beautiful, pristine with bursts of life along the coast. But I think my attention  was a bit short for academic life, so I started writing science stories for newspapers. My first staff job was at BBC Tomorrow’s World magazine, then BBC News Online. I went to New Scientist next and then the Financial Times. In 2008, I was delighted to be hired by the , which was – and is! – my favourite paper.How has awareness of the climate crisis changed in the last decade? What do you think the big milestones have been? When I joined the , concern about the climate crisis was running high, following a landmark report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Al Gore’s film, An Inconvenient Truth – the IPCC and Gore went on to win the Nobel peace prize. But it was seen as a future problem. The transformative moment was meant to come at the 2009 UN climate change conference in Copenhagen. But it didn’t happen and after that the impacts of the global financial crisis grabbed all the attention. It wasn’t until 2015, by which time the role of human activities in driving climate change was undeniable, that a big step forward was taken with the Paris deal. How has your role in covering the environment changed in that time? has always taken the environment very seriously. In the decade I have been here, the team has expanded. But the basic approach has largely stayed the same – environmental issues affect everything, so should feature across all our coverage: reporting, exposing and holding to account. Today, the climate crisis is here, evident in more frequent and more severe extreme weather and climate change deniers have been relegated to the far fringes. With the global youth climate strikes inspired by Greta Thunberg and the Extinction Rebellion protests, 2019 feels like a new chapter. Those who have campaigned for decades are feeling hopeful. What would you say are the most important environmental issues?The climate emergency is the best known, and it will take systemic change to beat it. But the annihilation of wildlife and the destruction of nature is just as crucial in my view – we depend on the natural world for almost everything. The huge scale of the losses – from forests to insects to marine life – has only really become widely reported in the last few years. Pollution is the third issue, particularly the toxic air that causes millions of early deaths every year. Air is actually getting cleaner in some rich nations, but the understanding of how damaging it is – on everything from intelligence to miscarriages – is only really emerging now. Chemical pollution is also a serious global problem, from fertiliser to pesticides to PCBsWhat frustrates you about how these issues are sometimes be covered?One thing is the charge of hypocrisy that is often levelled at environment campaigners because they have a TV or something. Just because you have to live in the world as it is today doesn’t mean you can’t campaign to make it a better place tomorrow. But I think hypocrisy is the attack made by people who know they’ve lost the real argument.Has your work influencedinformed the way you live your life?Yes. It’s impossible to write about it every day and not act. I am vegan at home and whenever I can elsewhere. My home is fully insulated and my energy supplier is renewable. I rarely fly for holidays – one short haul flight in the last couple of years – and usually go to Ireland by ferry to surf. I’ve also cycled to work for about 13 years now – it’s cheap, fast and healthy. Being green is often worthwhile for many reasons.What would you say to readers who want to tackle the environmental crisis?The big shifts will be driven by the governments we elect (in democracies) and the companies to which we give our custom. Demanding urgent action from those leaders is vital. But personal action is also important, in itself and as an encouragement to others. The biggest action, according to scientists, is having fewer children, but that of course is a deeply personal and complex choice. Flying less and eating less meat and dairy also make big cuts in your impact, as does driving fewer petrol-powered miles and insulating your home.How can we build on the urgency we’ve seen from many campaigners in 2019 and keep the spotlight fixed firmly on the big changes we need?We are in a race against time and it’s not at all certain that we are going to win. We understand the problems and what we have to do, more or less, but the pace of action is far too slow. Putting pressure on politicians and business leaders is key – giving them a strong reason to move faster. The good news is that many solutions gain their own momentum once started. In many places, solar and wind power is now the cheapest electricity, and electric cars are the cheapest to own. But there are still big problems to solve, including agriculture and aviation. The young people involved in the climate strikes will be running the world in the not-too-distant future. But we have to make sure we are still in the race by then.What have been the highlights of your reporting at the  so far? What has made you most proud?I have written nearly 2,000 stories for the , and I’d hope most of them have played a part in building awareness of environmental issues. It’s usually hard to know how much impact stories have behind the scenes, but the restoration of slashed flood defence funding in England followed a lot of reporting by me, as did the EU ban on neonicotinoid pesticides, which harm bees. The recent resignation of the executive director of the UN environment programme also followed a string of my stories, which was a good example of the  holding power to account. The environment team get a lot of positive feedback from readers, scientists and policymakers, which is very heartening. One prominent scientist recently told me: “Thank God for the !”What is the area within your work and reporting expertise that you feel most passionately about?Usually the story I’m working on right now. But in recent years I’ve done a lot on pesticides, insects, the impact of livestock, microplastics and harmful subsidies. And badgers. I’ve written a lot about the cull in England. One of my editors here said I had “made the  the paper of choice for small mammals”, which may or may not have been a compliment.What about the highs and lows of doing the job?Often, this is the best job in the world. I’ve been fortunate to see a lot of the Earth’s natural beauty. I’ve tracked forest elephants in Gabon, been swimming with giant mantas in the Males and walked through extraordinary landscapes high in the Andes. On the other hand, almost every day I have to report more destruction and degradation of the environment. The most heartbreaking story I have covered is the poisoning of children with lead in a former mining town in Zambia. But I was glad to be able to expose it at least.What’s next for you and the team?The next 12 months are going to be absolutely pivotal for the world. There’s a major UN bioersity conference in China next year – the targets set a decade ago have been woefully missed. The UN climate summit in Glasgow, UK, in 2020 will also be vital – nations are going to have to make big increases in the carbon cuts they pledge if we are to get anywhere near the 1.5C temperature rise seen as a safety limit. And we’ll be reporting day in, day out, across the world holding nations and companies to account for the environment and for social justice.What makes the  unique?John Vidal, my brilliant predecessor as environment editor, says: “Environment is the world and everything in it”, and I think the issue now permeates all the newspaper’s coverage. That is because the  has always taken the issue seriously, with full support from the top and the resources to match. Our readers really care too, and they tell us. I’d guess there aren’t many places where all that is the case."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b79c522c8ae1ecc3692d85f08f27c91ce353576d/0_54_2555_1533/master/2555.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7c7d3eaa0200cb9d609b6e69a4a614b","title":"amber rudd to step down as mp","story":"Former home secretary most high-profile of an increasing number standing downAmber Rudd and David Lidington, respectively the ex-home secretary and Theresa May’s former de facto deputy, have both announced they are among an increasing number of sitting MPs who will quit at the coming election.The departure of Rudd, who quit the cabinet and gave up the Conservative whip in September over Boris Johnson’s approach to Brexit, prompted a highly public spat with senior party figures.Announcing her departure, Rudd said she had hoped to rejoin the party ranks but was rebuffed by Mark Spencer, the chief whip. Rudd tweeted that Johnson had asked her to stand in the election as a Tory only last week.The departure of Lidington was notably more low-key. In a letter to his local newspaper, the Bucks Herald, the Aylesbury MP wrote: “Politics imposes a heavy cost on family and private life. That is not a complaint: people who seek elected office do so voluntarily.“But I have come to the conclusion that now is the right time for me to give a higher priority in terms of my time and energy, to Helen and my family who have given unstinting support to me during more than a quarter of a century in the House of Commons.”Rudd, once tipped as a future Conservative leader, told the Evening Standard: “I’m not finished with politics, I’m just not standing at this election.” She later tweeted: “Moving on. Good luck to colleagues in forthcoming GE.”Rudd told the Standard she had met Johnson to make amends with him. She said she planned to meet Spencer to formally seek a return. “I’m happy to leave the House of Commons as a Conservative MP,” she said.However, Spencer wrote to Rudd saying he was “not in a position to return the Conservative party whip to you”.In surrendering the whip, Spencer said to Rudd, it was “clear that you did not support the approach of the prime minister and did not have confidence in him. You have failed to provide me with assurances that you will not change your mind once more.”Having the party whip was “an honour, not a right, and as such it cannot be discarded or returned at will if it is to have any meaning,” Spencer wrote to Rudd, who has a majority of only 346 in her Hastings and Rye constituency.In return, Rudd tweeted: “Funny thing really, as just last week the PM asked me to stand in the general election. Afraid the chief whip has been briefed by the wrong ‘No 10 sources’ this morning but nonetheless I respect the decision he had been asked to make.”On Tuesday, 10 of 21 other Conservative MPs who were stripped of the whip for supporting a backbench-instigated bill seeking to block a no-deal Brexit were readmitted to the party.More than 50 MPs have so far announced they will stand down at the election, already well above the 31 who did not stand again in 2017. These were both two-year parliaments.More members have stood down before other elections, with 90 not standing again in 2015, and 149 in 2010.Rudd told the Standard: “I spoke to the prime minister and had a good meeting with him a few days ago. I’m really confident of my position. I will be leaving the House of Commons on perfectly good terms with the prime minister and I want him to succeed.”When she left the cabinet, Rudd condemned Johnson’s use of words such as “surrender” and “betrayal” over Brexit, warning it could incite violence against opponents.Rudd became an MP in 2010 and climbed the junior ministerial ranks before replacing Theresa May as home secretary in 2016, when May entered Downing Street. However, she was forced to resign two years later after failing to properly account for her role in the Windrush scandal about the treatment of Caribbean Britons.She returned to the cabinet as work and pensions secretary later the same year, but after Johnson replaced May she appeared increasingly uncomfortable with what she said was his pursuit of a no-deal Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6d641f3af04ca7a239613587d5bfb5117492fd2/0_85_2917_1750/master/2917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6239e78c5e131a096469da918423e262","title":"dirty tricks can be expected how europes media reacted to a december election","story":" says ‘Brexit election’ will be like no other while El País calls it ‘second referendum’Europe’s media and commentators couldn’t quite believe it: after months of indecision and immobility in London, some actual Brexit action. But, they warned, the coming election would be brutal – and may end up not resolving anything.“Hurrah! Something has moved within the walls of the palace of Westminster,” cheered France’s Libération. “The British parliament has finally agreed on … no, not Brexit, that would be too easy. But on snap elections, to be held on 12 December.”The paper noted that after another day of “barely comprehensible developments”, parliament would now be dissolved on 5 November, “the day the skies light up with bonfires and fireworks in memory of an earlier attempt to blow it up”.Johnson’s plan was to return to Westminster “with a comfortable majority, which will allow him to get his Brexit deal through parliament and therefore Britain to leave the EU on 31 January”, the paper said. “But it is a big bet.”Make no mistake, it added, these elections “will be won or lost on the question of Brexit. But will the British make a clear choice? Nothing is less sure. The risk of a new hung parliament is very real. In which case, all options remain open.”Le Monde said Johnson’s election bid “worked at the fourth try”. The prime minister had “risked complete and utter paralysis, without a parliamentary majority and with a freshly negotiated deal meeting more and more resistance from MPs”, it said.“But will the elections help Johnson regain the Conservatives’ lost majority? And above all: will they help the country out of its Brexit impasse?” If the Tories win, Britain could be out of the EU even before 31 January, Le Monde said.“But Labour has promised to renegotiate the deal and put it to a second referendum, and the Lib Dems to cancel Brexit entirely … In a country so deeply ided and fed up with Brexit, nothing is certain. The nightmare would be another hung parliament.”Germany’s Die Zeit rejoiced that at long last, “the House of Commons has reached a decision for something, rather than against”. But, the paper said, “as welcome as it is, the coming elections may solve nothing. The campaign will be hard and relentless, and rarely has it been so difficult to predict the outcome.”Stuck with his broken promise that Britain would leave the EU on 31 October “do or die”, Johnson will not be able to seek consensus, the paper predicted, noting that “the ability to compromise has been lost in Britain because of Brexit”.Instead, the prime minister will lead “a highly populist election campaign pitting the people, who finally want to see Brexit implemented and are represented by Johnson, against the elitist parliament that keeps stopping him … The 2016 referendum showed how dirty such campaigns can become.”Die Welt also predicted an ugly election. “All the polls put the Tories ahead,” the paper noted. “And Johnson can say he has a deal in his pocket, while Jeremy Corbyn only offers lingering uncertainty. The prime minister will be confrontational and a brutal campaign of dirty tricks can be expected.”But, the paper said, it is a high stakes gamble. “Brexit is the defining question of the election. So it is the Brexit “extremists” who could prove dangerous for Johnson: the Liberal Democrats, who want to reverse Brexit, and Nigel Farage and his Brexit party who want a no deal. They could cost Johnson a majority.”In the Netherlands, De Volkskrant agreed the campaign was likely to prove “the hardest, dirtiest, and most polarised in modern British history … In Dominic Cummings, the Tories have a strategist who will not shy away from underhand tactics. Among the Corbynistas, there is deep-rooted hatred of Johnson’s party.”Spain’s El País said none of the parties could be sure how they would do, “but the general conviction that there is no other way to escape the country’s Brexit’s paralysis ended up outweighing any doubts”. All knew, however, that the vote “will surely be a de facto second referendum on the UK’s exit from the EU”.In Sweden, Svenska Dagbladet said Johnson was “risking everything in a historic winter vote”. On the day the prime minister “looked certain to get his parliamentary election”, the paper noted, “the Tories were leading in the polls, just as they did before the 2017 vote. Then, they lost big.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63755644f5abb9e7c3ef9a5dd2a47b03865c58e1/0_137_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a3792674e8505c9e19f882d620a4b4ea","title":"tactical voting could deliver remain victory in election study","story":"Conservatives could be denied majority if one in three remain supporters switch votesTactical voting could swing a victory for pro-remain parties in the December election, new research suggests.Boris Johnson would fail to get a majority if one in three pro-remain voters in England and Wales switched their vote, the campaign group Best for Britain said. In this scenario, the Conservatives would win 309 seats, Labour 233, the Liberal Democrats 34, Plaid Cymru four and the Greens one. When the Scottish National party, Democratic Unionist party and the Commons Speaker are factored in, this would give pro-remain parties a majority of four.Best for Britain has launched GetVoting.org to give tactical voting advice based on postcode. Naomi Smith, the organisation’s chief executive, said: “If we vote tactically we can stop a Boris Johnson majority and return a parliament that much more accurately reflects the state of the country’s views on the issue of Europe, which is now a majority pro-European country and we need a majority pro-European parliament.Under the first-past-the-post voting system, tactical voting is when you vote for a party that you would not normally support in order to stop another party from winning. For example, in a constituency where the result is usually tight between a party you dislike and a party you somewhat dislike, and the party you support usually comes a distant third and has no chance of winning, you might choose to lend your vote to the party you somewhat dislike. This avoids ‘“wasting” your vote on a party that cannot win the seat, and boosting the chances that the party you dislike most will lose.Best for Britain’s assessment was done on a seat-by-seat analysis with a poll of 46,000 British people in September and October. Without any tactical voting, the Tories would win a majority of 44, taking 364 seats to Labour’s 189, it said.There are concerns that the remain vote is split across five political parties, including Labour, while the leave vote is split between the Tories and Brexit party.Lewis Bastion, an election expert, said at a launch event for the study in Westminster that in the current climate casting an “effective vote” was “all the more important because the remain tribe is more ided than the leave tribe”.The independent MP Dominic Grieve, who lost the Tory whip for trying to block a no-deal Brexit, was among those urging voters to act tactically. He said he could be a “direct beneficiary”, noting that the Lib Dem candidate in his constituency of Beaconsfield had decided to stand down to give him a better chance of winning.Grieve said: “This is often a difficult topic. Those who have party loyalty will always find it uncomfortable.”The former Lib Dem leader Vince Cable said tactical voting did not always mean candidates had to formally stand down for each other. He said: “The general pattern is the parties will be represented and the appeal to tactical voting is then how you use your vote. It’s not about standing down, except in a small number of cases.Anna McMorrin, the Labour MP for Cardiff North, who won with a 4,000 majority in 2017, made a plea for tactical voting.She said: “It is crucial that tactical voting plays a part. I know the damage that Brexit will do to our communities across the country and that’s why we need to work together as MPs and candidates to return that remain parliament.“There’s a Lib Dem candidate currently standing against me, there’s Plaid Cymru standing against me. I hope people will understand that this is a bigger issue now because in my constituency that remain vote could split the vote and allow a Boris Johnson-supporting hard Brexiteer in.”She could not say whether the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, backed tactical voting.Bastion said the elections in 2015 and 2017 were hard to predict because of the number of people switching parties, and he expected the same to be true in 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39f628e6df708e96eba9819a2c02837bfb6298ce/3180_722_1829_1097/master/1829.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=332bec3bb019118ed9f4b08e092c526b","title":"chris packham i wanted to know how my parents lives were shaped","story":"In a bid to help TV presenter Chris Packham understand more about his heritage,  Sue George went on a mission to see how much she could discover about his ancestors in just a weekBoats have always been around me,” says conservationist, campaigner and TV presenter Chris Packham, who leads a hugely busy life filming and writing about the natural world. “My father was a marine engineer, but port employment or work within the merchant navy didn’t appeal to me.”Born in Southampton, where his parents met and married, Packham’s main interest in finding out more about his family tree was to discover what had shaped his background.“I understand the contribution my parents made but, further back, I want to know how their lives were shaped and influenced by others.“I am a realist and pragmatist,” he says. “Context is everything and not all is happy-jolly.”This is evident in the life of his mother, Rita, who died in 2011 Packham knew very little about her side of the family, but Ancestry was on hand to provide further details about his background.

Packham had not known that his maternal grandmother, Gertie Kinnard, not only had to suffer the worry of her son being in hospital, but that her 71-year-old father, Alfred, had been wounded in the attack too. He died of his wounds a month later.“That’s a degree of trauma that would be difficult to imagine,” Packham says.Although Packham remembers his mother’s mother, he didn’t know anything about Gertie’s ancestors. It turns out that the men on the Kinnard side of the family were also connected to both seafaring and Southampton. His three-times great-grandfather, David Kinnard (1804-1883), lived in Sussex but his son, also called David (1833-1894), went to work in the Southampton docks during the 1860s.Records showed that the younger David’s sons followed him into the maritime industries. These men – Frederick, Harry, Frank, Thomas and Alfred – started their working lives in jobs related to seafaring. Frank became an apprentice sail maker, while the other three ran errands around the docks. They later joined the merchant navy or worked in ship repair.One image uploaded to Ancestry tells another sad tale: a photograph of a gravestone in Southampton. David Kinnard and his wife, Emma, were buried there, as was Alfred in 1941. But the first person whose details were inscribed was David and Emma’s son, Packham’s great-great-uncle, Harry. Harry died in 1889, aged 19, on his “first voyage at sea”.Another sea tragedy that was already well known to the family concerns his paternal grandfather, Harold Packham. He joined his first ship, the SS Moliere, at the age of 17, in 1921, in the role of “wireless watcher”, or operator. The boat took three months to travel from Barry, in Wales, to California via the Panama canal and back again, carrying cargoes of fruit and salmon. Later, Harold moved to Southampton and worked crewing yachts, at one point going to the remote Cocos Islands with the racing driver and treasure-hunter Malcolm Campbell.In 1933, when Packham’s father, Colin, was a baby, Harold died. He had been on a steamer that foundered off the coast of Aldeburgh, Suffok, leading to the death of all on board. The ship was carrying coal from Blyth, near Newcastle, to Kent. While evidence from inspectors and past crew members indicated the ship had been unfit to sail – there was a Board of Trade inquiry, and the matter was even raised in parliament – the sinking was ruled as “death by misadventure”.In spite of his family background, Packham considers how he “bucked the trend” of the employment taken by many of his relatives.“That’s probably because, being born in 1961, I had an education available to me that none of them would have had.“People of our generation have seen technological and scientific breakthroughs, but we are now conscious of what they have cost us. Ours will be a very interesting generation to look back on,” he says.Uncover your story. Discover your backstory by charting your family tree.

The 49-year-old is a former Yorkshire teammate of Chris Silverwood, whose promotion to head coach at the start of the month left a vacancy in the backroom staff.Though not expected to be a contender for a full-time bowling coach role because of his commitments with TalkSport, Gough will join the squad for their two-week warm-up period before the first Test in Mount Maunganui that begins on 20 November. Earlier this month Jeetan Patel was appointed as a spin-bowling coach for the tour on another short-team deal.Silverwood said: “I’m delighted to have Darren on board. I have known him a long time and his vast knowledge and experience at international level will drive our bowling unit forward leading into the two-match Test series. He will be excellent around the group and will settle in quickly.”Gough, who claimed 229 Test wickets during his playing career, has been invited to England training sessions previously. While he has forged a media career since retiring as a player in 2009, the former fast bowler has also taken his coaching badges up to level three.“I will gain a lot from the experience and to work at this level will benefit me as a coach for the long term.

On one hand it’s a reflection of how difficult this long tennis season is, but it’s particularly worrying news for Andreescu who has already had a startling amount of injuries at 19 years old. She just can’t stay fit and it seems like she is going to have to manage her body for a long time.Well, with Andreescu out, here are the simple scenarios. American Sofia Kenin will take her place in the final match against Elina Svitolina if Andreescu can’t play.There it is. Pliskova puts together another solid service game, but Andreescu is still struggling to move. She lets the final Pliskova serve go and retires from the match. Brutal.First set: Karolina Pliskova *5-3 Bianca Andreescu: Pliskova has decided to simply play her game and control the rallies. It is working. After a slew of winners including a peach of a drop shot, she breaks with a brilliant angled backhand return winner. Surely this won’t last more than a set?First set: Karolina Pliskova 4-3* Bianca Andreescu: Andreescu is still crushing groundstrokes, but plenty are flying out. Some solid serving from Pliskova and she holds for 15.First set: Karolina Pliskova *3-3 Bianca Andreescu: “If this was Simona…” said Andreescu during her discussion with her coach. She wouldn’t be able to last in the long rallies against a defensive player like Halep, but the rallies today are short and staccato and she thinks it’s worth a try. Andreescu is just teeing off on her groundstrokes now and some are landing in. After saving three break points with booming groundstrokes, she moves to game point and bellows “Come on!” down the court. She is fighting.That was a tough on-court coaching break for Andreescu. A tearful Andreescu said that she twisted her knee, heard it crack and the trainer told her that she had hurt her meniscus. She can’t bend her knee at all and she is hearing cracks as she moves around.Andreescu’s coach, Sylvain Bruneau, told her not to push it. “I don’t want to stop,” she responded, wiping tears from her eyes. On she goes...First set: Karolina Pliskova 3-2* Bianca Andreescu: Pliskova holds, but also spare a thought for her. She had to save three break points, hit two consecutive double faults and a couple of howlers off easy short balls. Facing an injured player is never easy.First set: Karolina Pliskova *2-2 Bianca Andreescu: This is a struggle. Pliskova is mostly just putting the ball down the middle of the court, but even moving around the ball is proving too much for Andreescu at the moment who has already made a slew of errors since returning to court. Pliskova snaps a great backhand down the line to break back.First set: Karolina Pliskova 1-2* Bianca Andreescu: Andreescu skips through two points and Pliskova gets on the board after a netted backhand from the Canadian. The crowd is deathly silent. The trainer is back on the court and deep in discussion with Andreescu. It seems like she took some painkillers.Medical timeout over. Andreescu is back on the court with a heavily strapped knee. We’ll see if she can move.Andreescu is officially taking a medical timeout. The trainer is wrapping up her left knee and she looks extremely frustrated.First set: Karolina Pliskova *0-2 Bianca Andreescu: Well, forget my last comment! Andreescu lunges for a forehand and now she is struggling to walk. She limps to the bench. This does not look good.This doesn’t seem to have too much to do with her back problems yesterday though. The trainer is taking a look at Andreescu’s left knee.First set: Karolina Pliskova *0-2 Bianca Andreescu: Andreescu consolidates the break with ease and with plenty of help from some loose errors by Pliskova. Physically, Andreescu looks fine so far.First set: Karolina Pliskova 0-1* Bianca Andreescu:  Andreescu strikes in the opening game but that was some strange play from Pliskova. Pliskova led 40-0, then missed a couple of first serves and dumped a forehand drive volley into the net. She had five game points in total, but Andreescu took her very first break point. What’s already clear that Pliskova’s second serve is going to be under attack today.Wherever you are in the world, please stop what you are doing and watch this absolutely insane forehand from Svitolina today.Hello! Welcome to our coverage of day 4 of the WTA Finals in Shenzhen. A few moments ago, Elina Svitolina defeated Simona Halep 7-5 6-3 a tough, physical match to qualify for the semi-finals, leaving only one spot in the Purple Group. Halep attempted every single shot in her arsenal but she simply couldn’t consistently pierce the Svitolina defence. Do not expect Bianca Andreescu and Karolina Pliskova to have the same amount of patience today.US Open champion Andreescu comes in with plenty of question marks after she ended her brilliant, gripping three setter with Simona Halep looking physically compromised. The trainer tended to her back multiple times during the third set and she struggled with her movement by the end. However, we know that Andreescu’s body is brittle yet she has only lost 6 times this year and her level against Halep was otherwise great. Hopefully the day off provided her enough time to recover.Another factor that won’t help Pliskova’s serve is that she is facing one of the best returners in the world. Andreescu is 5th in the world for return games won this year and she will look to smother Pliskova’s second serve as frequently as possible. Despite the slow courts, both players will be looking to dominate with their weapons and take control of the exchanges. Andreescu holds the upper hand in the head to head after winning their only clash in three sets at the Rogers Cup in the summer.As usual, please feel free to email me at tumaini.carayol@the or tweet me at @tumcarayol."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f233cdceba97061b2e121e16e07e39d77dd5c3d/0_26_3360_2016/master/3360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4744b2be65f02f70093b8f0a3e45d82f","title":"ai becomes grandmaster in fiendishly complex starcraft ii","story":"DeepMind’s AlphaStar masters game dubbed ‘next grand challenge for AI’ in just 44 days‘The challenge was to play like a human’: AI takes on the gamersAn artificial intelligence (AI) system has reached the highest rank of StarCraft II, the fiendishly complex and wildly popular computer game, in a landmark achievement for the field.The AI system mastered the game after 44 days of training, which involved learning from recordings of the best human players and then going up against itself and versions of the programme that intentionally tested its weaknesses.“AlphaStar has become the first AI system to reach the top tier of human performance in any professionally played e-sport on the full unrestricted game under professionally approved conditions,” said David Silver, a researcher at DeepMind.More than $31m in prize money has been handed out from thousands of StarCraft II e-sport tournaments since the game was released in 2010. Players start with a small number of worker units that can gather resources, construct buildings, develop new units and technologies, and embark on scouting missions to gain intelligence on opponents. Top players need adaptable short and long-term strategies to grow and defend their bases while laying waste to the opposition. To complicate matters, players cannot see the whole “map” of the game, so decisions are made on partial information.“Ever since computers cracked Go, chess and poker, the game of StarCraft has emerged, essentially by consensus from the community, as the next grand challenge for AI,” Silver said. “It’s considered to be the game which is most at the limit of human capabilities.”DeepMind created AlphaStar “agents” that play as each of the races in the game, namely Protoss, Terran and Zerg. Each race has different capabilities and technologies which favour distinct defensive and offensive strategies. AlphaStar first learned the basics from watching top human players. Then it entered the “AlphaStar league” where it played not only itself, but “exploiter” agents, which are versions of the AI that specifically targeted AlphaStar’s weak points. The training ensured that AlphaStar became a formidable opponent against all three races and every strategy.The DeepMind team restricted AlphaStar’s capabilities, ensuring for example that it could not perform moves at superhuman speeds. This proved crucial to the AI’s success, because instead of beating humans through speed alone, it was forced to learn winning long-term strategies. Oriol Vinyals, the lead researcher on the project, said AIs like AlphaStar could potentially be used to improve personal assistants, self-driving cars, weather predictions and climate models. The work was published in the scientific journal Nature.Dan Klein, a professor of computer science at the University of California at Berkeley, who was not involved in the work, said it was an exciting achievement driven by key advances. “What’s great about StarCraft as a testbed for AI is that all its complexities happen at once,” he said.While DeepMind states that it will never be involved in military work, and Starcraft II is not a realistic war simulation, the results will be of interest to the military, said Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of AI and robotics at the University of Sheffield. In March, a US government report described how AI enriched battlefield simulations and allowed wargamers to assess the potential outcomes of different tactics.“Military analysts will certainly be eyeing the successful AlphaStar real-time strategies as a clear example of the advantages of AI for battlefield planning. But this is an extremely dangerous idea with the potential for humanitarian disaster. AlphaStar learns strategy from big data in one particular environment. The data from conflicts such as Syria and Yemen would be too sparse to be of use,” said Sharkey.“And as DeepMind explained at a recent United Nations event, such methods would be highly dangerous for weapons control as the moves are unpredictable and can be creative in unexpected ways. This is against the laws that govern armed conflict.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdeb148a667c45319aae1dd9e7eaf8a83db98bb2/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f33adad1b63a523796c210128e79dbb","title":"extraordinary tfl criticised over uber licence extension","story":"Firm had to promise to verify drivers’ identities, in deal attacked by London cabbiesTransport for London made Uber promise to verify drivers’ identities and ensure their documents are genuine in exchange for a temporary licence to operate, in a deal that drew an incredulous response from the trade body for black-cab drivers.The ride-hailing firm was granted a two-month extension to its licence in September after TfL refused to issue it with a full permit to operate in the capital amid concerns over the company’s attitude towards the safety of passengers.The temporary extension came with several new conditions attached, according to documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.One condition, headlined “driver identity”, demands that the company put in place systems to ensure that any drivers using the app are licensed by TfL and registered with Uber. TfL asked for the pledge after a case in which a woman in Leeds was raped by a man using his brother’s login details to drive an Uber, which is not permitted by the app.Among other new conditions is a requirement that Uber ensure that drivers don’t use “f raudulent” documents for their licence or insurance.In a letter to TfL, seen by the , the Licensed Taxi Drivers’ Association (LTDA), which represents black-cab drivers in London, said it was “extraordinary” that such conditions needed to be imposed in the first place.“It should go without saying that London private hire vehicle operators … should have robust policies and procedures in place to ensure that drivers are who they say they are, and that they have the requisite valid licences and insurances in place,” lawyers for the LTDA wrote.They said the content of the conditions fuelled concerns that Uber’s enthusiasm for innovation was “not matched by any corresponding interest in dealing with the public safety pitfalls such innovation causes”.Uber said it had made “significant changes” to its business over the past two years, amid mounting concern about the risks that its business model poses to passengers.“This includes launching new safety features for riders, introducing better protections for licensed drivers and we’ve improved our corporate governance and compliance,” said a spokesperson.A TfL spokesperson said: “We have granted a licence to Uber London Limited to operate for two months while we request additional material from them and will consider that information as part of any future licensing decision.“As with other operators, we have attached a number of conditions to Uber London Limited’s licence, which we consider necessary and appropriate to ensure passenger safety and security.”The ride-hailing app is expected to seek a permanent licence or another extension at the end of the two-month period."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e97d76ab2bbdf53554fd0a0f27181e42468cdb7/0_22_1890_1134/master/1890.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b785eadb22a2469eafb248047d32bf7b","title":"facebook removes africa accounts linked russian troll factory yevgeny prigozhin","story":"Fake networks in eight nations are connected to man allegedly behind disinformation empireFacebook has taken down accounts linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin – the businessman allegedly behind Russia’s notorious troll factory – which were actively seeking to influence the domestic politics of a range of African countries.The company said on Wednesday it had suspended three networks of “inauthentic” Russian accounts. The Facebook pages targeted eight countries across the continent: Madagascar, the Central African Republic (CAR), Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Sudan and Libya.All were linked to Progozhin, a Russian tycoon who is close to Vladimir Putin. The US has previously indicted Prigozhin for interfering in the 2016 presidential election. It accuses him of running a global disinformation media empire and of funding the Internet Research Agency, the St Petersburg troll factory that boosted Donald Trump.Facebook’s head of cybersecurity policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, said Russia used almost 200 fake and compromised accounts to reach more than 1 million followers in Africa. Russian-run networks worked closely with locals in order to disguise the sites’ true origins, he said.“There’s sort of a joining of forces, if you will, between local actors and actors from Russia,” he told Reuters. “It appears that the local actors who are involved know who is behind the operation.”In recent years the Kremlin has made considerable efforts to cultivate African rulers. Last week Putin held the first ever Russia-Africa forum in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, attended by more than 40 African heads of state.Prigozhin has led Russia’s push in Africa. Mercenaries from Wagner – a shadowy private military contractor linked to Prigozhin – have been sent to the Central African Republic. Prigozhin entities have also established media outlets in several African countries and have sent Russian “advisers” to help with elections.Moscow’s aim is to bolster existing governments and smear pro-western opposition parties, it appears. Documents seen by the  earlier this year envisage grooming a new generation of African “leaders” and undercover “agents”, and pushing out former colonial powers such as France or the UK.Facebook said one fake network was centred on Sudan, where in late 2018 Russia tried unsuccessfully to prop up President Omar al-Bashir, who was deposed in April. Another – featuring 35 accounts and 53 pages – was run out of Madagascar and Mozambique. A third was focused on Libya.The campaigns shut down for meddling in Africa had posted about local news and geopolitical issues, as well as sharing content from local and Russian state media including Sputnik and RT. Some of the accounts were active as far back as 2014, Facebook said.The company did not identify which accounts had been suspended.  found that the Facebook page of a French-language news service, Afrique Panorama, based in Madagascar’s capital, Antananarivo, was no longer working.Also not working is the account for Afric, a South Africa-based website previously linked with a Russian attempt to meddle in the country’s recent election by backing the ruling African National Congress. The campaign appears to have had little impact.Researchers at the Stanford Internet Observatory, the research lab at Stanford University, said the networks used a variety of techniques across the African countries.Some accounts supported a specific party or candidate, they said, while others backed multiple figures. In other cases, the pages appeared geared towards building support for Wagner activities or Russian deals for gold, diamonds and other natural resources.The takedown on Wednesday was Facebook’s second move against groups it linked to Prigozhin in a week. Last week the company said it had suspended a network of 50 Instagram accounts connected with the Internet Research AgencyPrigozhin has denied US claims he finances the troll factory and says Wagner does not exist."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6782d49ba13799c0933bd5ac5998ce97c7d3355/0_124_6082_3649/master/6082.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afcf9edc19c0dd7669052837d48cfa64","title":"the gatwick trial and six other ways to make travel much less stressful","story":"Changing escalator etiquette, introducing variable speed limits, and gadgets that get us to green traffic lights can all help in the quest to make travel more efficientGatwick airport is experimenting with new ways to board passengers to ease the journey from gate to seat. A trial has begun with EasyJet to board people in “columns” – window seats, then middle seats, then aisle seats. This technique, nicknamed “WilMA”, has been used by other airlines, including Delta and United. How else could travel be sped up and smoothed out with a few simple tweaks?Board airline passengers in alternate rowsThis would enable passengers to put their bags in the overhead locker without preventing others from reaching their seats. “Carry-on luggage is the thing that takes the most time,” says Burak Boyaci, a lecturer at the Centre for Transport and Logistics at the University of Lancaster. A 2008 study in the Journal of Air Transport Management showed that a full plane with two doors and no carry-on luggage could be boarded in three minutes 18 seconds.Ask passengers to stand on both sides of the escalatorTransport for London experimented with this at Holborn underground station in 2016. It found that the escalators could carry an average of 151 passengers per minute compared with 115 when travellers were permitted to stand on the right and walk on the left. However, this approach doesn’t work on short escalators. Hong Kong, Washington DC and Tokyo have also experimented.Or better still, walk on both sidesIntroduce more variable speed limitsReducing the speed limit on a motorway helps to keep traffic flowing. “If you increase the density of traffic, after a certain point, the system starts to fall down,” Boyaci explains. Slowing the traffic enables a greater capacity because it reduces the safe distance needed between vehicles.Install more diagonal pedestrian crossingsIt can be frustrating to wait for two sets of lights at a crossroads. The diagonal crossings at Oxford Circus in London and Shibuya in Tokyo allow high volumes of pedestrians to cross simultaneously.Help road users to reach green lightsA Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory system can inform motorists of the speed necessary to reach a traffic light on green.

It allows you to slow down and think.What are you waiting for?Here are five routes – two at home, three abroad – to get you started. All can be booked through Trainline’s app or website.Glasgow to Mallaig via Fort WilliamIf you want to get kids used to travelling by train, take them north to see the magnificent curving viaduct of Glenfinnan, which is used to carry the Hogwarts Express in the Harry Potter films. The West Highland line is regularly described as one of the most scenic in the British Isles, if not the world (beating even the Trans-Siberian), being a procession of mouthwatering lochs, moors and mountains. From Mallaig you can take ferries to several of the islands of the Inner Hebrides.Getting to Glasgow: you have a choice of trains from London (or other mainline stations in Britain).Typical journey time: Glasgow to Mallaig, 5 hours 16 minutes direct.Nice (Provence, France) to Pisa (Tuscany, Italy)Steep wooded hills tumble into the sea all along the beautiful coast of Liguria from the French border near Ventimiglia to the ancient port city of Genoa and beyond. This trip makes a relaxing way to get to Tuscany along the Riviera. If you are tempted to break up the journey, you may want to visit the resorts of San Remo or Portofino, or one of the dramatically sited and colourful towns of the Cinque Terre.Getting to Nice: take the Eurostar and change at Paris Gare du NordParis Gare de Lyon.Typical journey time: 6 hours 30 minutes, with one or two changes at Ventimiglia andor Genova.Vienna to Klagenfurt via the Semmering PassThis trans-Alpine line was built in 1854 to link the capital of imperial Austria with the Mediterranean. It was a huge engineering achievement and set the standard for mountain railways, for which it has been declared a world heritage site. Take a seat on the left side of the train by preference. The views are superb as you cross the 895-metre (2,900 ft) Semmering Pass, the highlight of the journey. You can extend your trip via Villach to reach Venice: travelling from central to southern Europe in one exhilarating journey.To get to Vienna: take the Eurostar and change at Brussels and Frankfurt.Typical journey time: Vienna to Klagenfurt, 3 hours 55 minutes direct.Leeds to Carlisle via SettleIt has been described as the line that should never have been built, being a technical challenge that was financially ruinous and costly in the lives of navvies. When it was threatened with closure in the 1980s, the Settle-Carlisle line was rediscovered by train lovers, day-trippers and hill walkers and given a second life. Leaving industrial West Yorkshire, climb into the Yorkshire Dales national park via the Ribblehead viaduct to reach the highest mainline station in England, Dent, at an altitude of 350 metres (1,150 ft). Great views of the austere Pennines are guaranteed.Getting to Leeds: there are plenty of high-speed mainline trains from London.Typical journey time: Leeds to Carlisle, 2 hours 40 minutes direct.Cologne to MainzFancy a river cruise through the Rhine Gorge – only, by train? There are railway lines on both banks of the river, giving splendid views of the gorge, which stretches for 40 miles between Koblenz and Bingen. The east bank line is more scenic, but not as well-serviced as the western side, which has a wider choice of trains – so take the west-bank mainline through Bonn. Or, if you don’t mind taking a slightly more circuitous route, you could go down one and back up the other. Either way, en route are innumerable magnificent castles – whether real, mock or ruined – and pretty villages with half-timbered houses.To get to Cologne: take the Eurostar from London St Pancras and change at Brussels.Typical journey time: Cologne to Mainz, 1 hour 40 minutes.Journey times and ticket prices vary according to which particular options you choose.Ticket to rideIt is easy to book the train for your next adventure.

There was nothing wrong with this year’s contestants, but what usually sets Bake Off apart are the people you never normally see on reality TV: the Vals, the Flos, the Terrys. I didn’t think it mattered at first, but in hindsight it shifted the entire atmosphere in the tent, and left older viewers without a representative, unless you count Henry and his prematurely-aged ways.Next, make the technical challenges vaguely recognisable. Two years ago, contestants were making mini rolls and molten chocolate puddings. This year: Maids of Honour, Sicilian cassatelles and Gâteau Saint Honorés. Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith’s reasoning is that standards have risen, but we have all witnessed the weekly montages of bewildered faces and total confusion. At times, it has felt like we were one week away from Prue demanding they whip up something she thought of in a dream.Third? Turn down the heat. The allure of Bake Off has always been the illusion that it is a quaint little show, when actually it is an anxiety-driven thrill ride watching people lose it while trying to add a marzipan layer to their Battenburg. This series, however, bakers have been reduced to tears four times during a technical, including in the final, where Steph and Alice both buckled under the pressure. Noel’s whispers of reassurance and Sandi’s hugs have gone from rarities to weekly occurrences. In other reality shows this kind of thing would be normal. Here, it is crushing.But Bake Off’s biggest issue, and the one that really takes the biscuit, is the judging. The cruelty hasn’t ramped up over time it came out of nowhere this year. Prue slated everyone’s vertical pie showstoppers in one fell swoop: Sandi called the pies a “visual feast” and Prue replied “unfortunately that’s where it stopped.” Then she attacked beloved goth Helena with the barb: “If you shut your eyes, it’s a nice sponge cake.” And of course there was Paul “jokingly” storming out of the tent because he thought the technicals were awful, and going to town on Priya repeatedly, accusing her of “boiling” her custard and calling her meringue “horrible”. He also reeled off a non-stop list of failures to an already deflated Michael over his cheesecake surprise – “It droops, half of it is missing, it’s cracked down the middle, the icing looks terrible.”All of this harshness, plus Paul’s propensity to stand silently, aggressively beside bakers not answering their questions, no matter how many times they ask for help, makes the atmosphere in the tent all the more uncomfortable. It seems Bake Off is losing the very things that made it so special in the first place – its gentleness, and the sense that nothing could ever go too wrong. Now, not even Henry’s incredible tie collection could make everything OK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28dacc5d00d93a64ab25129c8b9358d2f3af5a85/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eed5174b5b30a6617af3be7fbc38e05e","title":"the women who broke the harvey weinstein story podcast","story":"When Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey began investigating Harvey Weinstein, they had no idea it would ignite a global reckoning on sexual harassment resulting in #MeToo. And: Rafael Behr on the likelihood of a winter electionIn the summer of 2017, the New York Times journalist Megan Twohey was on maternity leave when she received a call from a colleague, Jodi Kantor. The two had never spoken before, but Kantor was working on a story and needed Twohey’s help. It was an investigation into the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. What they uncovered became one of the biggest stories of our times, launching a global movement.  Rachel Humphreys talks to the journalists about how they convinced prominent actors and former Weinstein employees to speak to them, the lengths Weinstein was willing to go to in an attempt to prevent the story from becoming public, and what more needs to be done about sexual harassment in the workplace.  You can listen to the episode that Today in Focus recorded earlier this year with former Harvey Weinstein assistant Zelda Perkins here.

Now is not the time for a general election as too much uncertainty still surrounds Brexit, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said.Speaking at Government Buildings in Dublin, he said a pre-Christmas poll was not in the interests of the country.Mr Varadkar said the Brexit process was ongoing and the UK general election could see different parties and a new prime minister holding power at Westminster. “I don’t think it is the right thing for the country given the ongoing uncertainty around Brexit,” he said.“We don’t know what is going to happen on December 12th.“Perhaps Mr Johnson is going to win a majority and ratify the deal before Christmas and we get into talks on the future relationship, but it is also possible that the Brexit Party could hold power and we may not get the deal ratified and a hard Brexit could happen.“We could see a new government and we may get a new prime minister who wants to reopen negotiations entirely and negotiate a softer Brexit.”Mr Varadkar previously said he favours an election in May 2020.When asked if he would like to see Boris Johnson remain as prime minister after they had both worked to reach a Brexit deal, he said: “I’m not going to express an opinion on who should win the election in the UK that is absolutely a matter for the people who vote in those elections.“I really do hope that a new House of Commons is in a position to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement.“So far, Boris Johnson is the only one who wants to ratify the agreement... It is what I want but I also respect the will of the British people, no matter who is the prime minister and what government they decide to elect.”Earlier, Mr Varadkar told his Fine Gael Ministers there will not be a pre-Christmas general election.He made the comments at the weekly pre-Cabinet meeting of Fine Gael Ministers. No Fine Gael Minister disagreed with the Taoiseach’s view at the meeting. Although many of his ministers have lobbied for an early election, Mr Varadkar has been consistent, in public at least, in his own position that it should be held in May 2020.Mr Varadkar’s comments follow several days of internal Fine Gael speculation about the possibility of a pre-Christmas election with many in the party believing the party’s fortunes are riding high now. Some Fine Gael TDs were keen on a snap election to capitalise on the new Brexit deal and the discomfort in Fianna Fáil over ‘Votegate’ (where TDs voted for colleagues who were present in the Dáil chamber but who were not in their designated seats)and the uncertain outcome for Government TDs in the four by-elections to be held next month. Many in Fine Gael are also mindful of Enda Kenny’s decision in October 2015 to delay the last election until the following spring. As one senior Fine Gael figure said: “He rued the day of not going early. We will never get as good a chance. By January, the kudos will not last.”Four byelections are set to be held next month. Fianna Fáil and other parties have said they are prepared for an election whenever it happens.Earlier on Wednesday Fianna Fáil’s finance spokesperson Michael McGrath claimed “some Fine Gael ministers” were keen on an election so they could get out of their portfolios “because they are failing”.When asked to which Ministers he was referring, Mr McGrath said “health and housing” when discussing a possible date for the next general election on RTÉ radio’s Today with Sean O’Rourke show.Fine Gael TD Dara Murphy said he believed the public would be quite happy if a general election was held next month. The Cork North Central TD who will not be seeking re-election said that there is a window of opportunity to take advantage of a pause in Brexit negotiations as the UK faces a general election in December and the EU is “changing its political make up.”"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons october 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.General election latest news: Tories refuse to restore whip to Amber Rudd as she joins 55 other MPs leaving ParliamentTranscript of Trump Ukraine call \u0026#39missed out key details\u0026#39, White House official tells impeachment inquiryJeffrey Epstein did not kill himself says pathologist who witnessed autopsyBoy banned from trampoline because of his prosthetic legs receives £2.5k in discrimination claimBelgium bars Chinese professor suspected of spying for BeijingHalloween 2019: How Celtic trick-or-treating and Gaelic turnip-carving led to the American celebrationClimate change scientists say rising seas will flood three times more people than previously thoughtFurious Jair Bolsonaro denies link to assassination of left-wing politician Mary Beard given apology by Heathrow after security staff force her to strip down to the \u0026#34scrappy undies\u0026#34 and vest Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn set to make TV history with first head-to-head election debatesOver 500 nurseries and childminders are closing every month, figures show Russian submarines power into north Atlantic in biggest manoeuvre since Cold WarStudents with unconditional offers are more likely to drop out of university, analysis findsA level student hanged himself after throwing party at his parents\u0026#39 home which left the property damaged, inquest hearsFacial recognition software unable to recognise trans people, university study suggestsComment: Forget \u0026#34Workington Man\u0026#34 – if the Tories want to win a majority, the only way is Essex\tHe\u0026#39s set to decide this General Election, but who is the Workington man?Wednesday evening news briefing: Inside the Conservative election machine as 56 MPs say they will not stand on December 12Comment: The election campaign hasn’t even begun – but the Tories’ cunning plan is already clearChile cancels hosting APEC and climate summit after unrestWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/28/TELEMMGLPICT000214394992_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqN_gmPEf4gh9KGKN0H_DnH6iTdqopZKAmCqsSaBJjyVE.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"jeremy vine earns samira ahmed famous should","story":"Samira Ahmed is taking the BBC to a tribunal over equal pay How familiar to you is the TV presenter Samira Ahmed?

The 10-minute trend is for the future and is essential for adoption of electric vehicles because it solves the range anxiety problem.”Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Google celebrates its 21st birthday on September 27.

Typical lithium-ion batteries would only last around 60 charges using the new method.The discovery comes just weeks after the inventors of the first lithium-ion battery were awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.The combined work of John Goodenough, Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino\u0026nbspled to the first commercially viable lithium-ion battery being produced in 1985. They are now used in everything from mobile phones to laptops, as well as the rapidly growing electric vehicle industry.Elon Musk says ‘cyberpunk’ Tesla pick-up truck coming in NovemberThe researchers now hope to improve this charge time to just five minutes.“We are working to charge an energy-dense electric vehicle battery in five minutes without damaging it,” Mr Wang said.“This will require highly stable electrolytes and active materials in addition to the self-heating structure we have invented.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Someone help me I can\u0027t stop smiling.Other notable donors to the campaign include Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, who pledged 150,000 trees, and various prominent YouTube channels.Enough money has been donated so far to plant more than 8 million trees, which will be undertaken by the Arbor Day Foundation.For every dollar you donate, one tree will be planted in a forest of high need around the globe, the TeamTrees campaign website states.Due to the sheer volume of trees planted, they will be planted in a variety of forests on public and private lands in areas of great need. Many of these forests will be state and national forests managed by government agencies. The goal is to plant trees on every continent not named Antarctica.The goal is to raise $20 million by the end of 2019 and for planting to begin in January 2020. All of the trees funded through the campaign will be planted before December 2022.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The presenter was also diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) after the crash occurred.\u0026nbspCelebrities such as Kate Garraway,\u0026nbspRichard Madeley, Blue singer Duncan James and Love Island star Amy Hart are rumoured to be joining this year\u0027s line-up.Created with Sketch.The best TV shows of 2019 (so far) Show all 41Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 241 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” 341 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”“Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 541 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” 641 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”“You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” “West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” 941 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” 1441 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.1741 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.2041 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.2241 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham’s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\u0027Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett’s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.\u00272541 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different. Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.Timely, bleak, intelligent and compelling, Chernobyl is a triumph of a disaster.Season three\u0027s knuckle-whitening finale is far less disappointing than the last.The writing is sharp and well observed, probing the fault lines between small talk and real problems.A touching tribute to a flawed reality TV star.Despite the strength of its ensemble cast, Succession is a feat of writing above all. Although it is ostensibly a business show, you won’t learn much about the minutiae of media deals by watching it. Its key dynamic, between father and children, means that it is limited in the amount that can actually happen without risking the magic. The writers, led by the creator Jesse Armstrong, who also gave us Peep Show, weave just-about-plausible and sympathetic characters from a web of insults and backstabbing, and tight editing and camerawork ratchets up tension from a slow-moving plot.In Kathy Burke’s All Women on Channel 4, the unapologetic, effing-and-blinding, salt-of-the-earth actor meets lots of different women – from nuns to reality stars – to understand what it means to be a member of the fairer sex, so to speak, in 2019.So here we have an intriguing, but rather flawed sort of Big Brother thriller set in our contemporary world of digital snooping, near constant surveillance and (a topical touch) widespread use of facial recognition technology.Top Boy can be bleak and violent, with dialogue so naturalistic that it verges on the impenetrable, but in telling stories that rarely get heard, it asks us to think differently about the city we live in.Criminal uses its small canvas to ask big questions. The focus on these intricate dances means that after a while we begin to question the idea of objective truth, as well as the facts at hand. I have no idea if it is a realistic depiction of detective work, but it makes for gripping drama.3641 Tories at WarAfter an hour of Tories at War (Channel 4), I felt I had to get out into the fresh air and go for a walk. The foul language the visceral hatred the unbearable tensions the violence being inflicted on ancient institutions and this poor old knackered country by the Tories, as if with chainsaws and zombie knives – it was like watching my first Saw movie.3741 World on FireIn a TV world where too often we are encouraged to see the Nazis as warm and cuddly real people with emotions, it’s refreshing that they are here relegated back to pure baddies, strafing cafes, shooting surrendering fathers and generally being Nazi-ish about things.3841 Catherine the GreatAt last, an answer to the question, what could be more fabulous than Helen Mirren playing The Queen? Helen Mirren playing an empress, altogether madder, badder and more dangerous to shag. Better costumes, too.Sarah Phelps’s adaptation of crime writer Tana French’s novels finds two detectives trying to solve the murder of a young girl, with plenty of twists and turns.Romance is complicated, cathartic and messy, regardless of age or circumstance. But such uncomfortable realities are swept beneath the rug in John Carney’s rigorously whimsical new Amazon series. Modern Love is adapted from a New York Times column (it also spawned a hit podcast) and is as much a valentine to a fantasia vision of Manhattan as it is a dissection of the human heart.Damon Lindelof’s version of the beloved graphic novel is a compelling demonstration of what can happen when source material is treated with sensitivity and imagination.“As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 241 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”.

Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.Timely, bleak, intelligent and compelling, Chernobyl is a triumph of a disaster.Season three\u0027s knuckle-whitening finale is far less disappointing than the last.The writing is sharp and well observed, probing the fault lines between small talk and real problems.A touching tribute to a flawed reality TV star.Despite the strength of its ensemble cast, Succession is a feat of writing above all. Although it is ostensibly a business show, you won’t learn much about the minutiae of media deals by watching it. Its key dynamic, between father and children, means that it is limited in the amount that can actually happen without risking the magic. The writers, led by the creator Jesse Armstrong, who also gave us Peep Show, weave just-about-plausible and sympathetic characters from a web of insults and backstabbing, and tight editing and camerawork ratchets up tension from a slow-moving plot.In Kathy Burke’s All Women on Channel 4, the unapologetic, effing-and-blinding, salt-of-the-earth actor meets lots of different women – from nuns to reality stars – to understand what it means to be a member of the fairer sex, so to speak, in 2019.So here we have an intriguing, but rather flawed sort of Big Brother thriller set in our contemporary world of digital snooping, near constant surveillance and (a topical touch) widespread use of facial recognition technology.Top Boy can be bleak and violent, with dialogue so naturalistic that it verges on the impenetrable, but in telling stories that rarely get heard, it asks us to think differently about the city we live in.Criminal uses its small canvas to ask big questions. The focus on these intricate dances means that after a while we begin to question the idea of objective truth, as well as the facts at hand. I have no idea if it is a realistic depiction of detective work, but it makes for gripping drama.3641 Tories at WarAfter an hour of Tories at War (Channel 4), I felt I had to get out into the fresh air and go for a walk. The foul language the visceral hatred the unbearable tensions the violence being inflicted on ancient institutions and this poor old knackered country by the Tories, as if with chainsaws and zombie knives – it was like watching my first Saw movie.3741 World on FireIn a TV world where too often we are encouraged to see the Nazis as warm and cuddly real people with emotions, it’s refreshing that they are here relegated back to pure baddies, strafing cafes, shooting surrendering fathers and generally being Nazi-ish about things.3841 Catherine the GreatAt last, an answer to the question, what could be more fabulous than Helen Mirren playing The Queen? Helen Mirren playing an empress, altogether madder, badder and more dangerous to shag. Better costumes, too.Sarah Phelps’s adaptation of crime writer Tana French’s novels finds two detectives trying to solve the murder of a young girl, with plenty of twists and turns.Romance is complicated, cathartic and messy, regardless of age or circumstance. But such uncomfortable realities are swept beneath the rug in John Carney’s rigorously whimsical new Amazon series. Modern Love is adapted from a New York Times column (it also spawned a hit podcast) and is as much a valentine to a fantasia vision of Manhattan as it is a dissection of the human heart.Damon Lindelof’s version of the beloved graphic novel is a compelling demonstration of what can happen when source material is treated with sensitivity and imagination.Last year’s series of I’m a Celebrity scored the show’s most-watched final episode in five years as millions tuned in to watch former football manager Harry Redknapp be crowned king of the jungle.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They switch places and find themselves falling in love with the men in each other\u0027s lives.\u0026nbspAccording to Netflix, the sequel will spell trouble for Duchess Margaret and Kevin, Stacy\u0027s friend.\u0026nbspIn the sequel, Duchess Margaret unexpectedly inherits the throne and hits a rough patch with Kevin so it\u0027s up to Stacy to save the day before a new lookalike – party girl Fiona – foils their plans, a tweet from Netflix\u0027s What\u0027s Next?

He refuses at first – but when his hair turns white, a beard and belly grow overnight, and children start approaching him with their wish lists, he reluctantly takes the mantle. It’s weirder and darker than it has any right to be, but it’s enjoyable to watch.When writer and director Billy Wilder first watched Brief Encounter, in which two people use a friend’s house to consummate an affair, he wrote in his notebook: “What about the poor schnook who has to crawl into the still-warm bed of the lovers?” The result of that scribble is The Apartment, a film that, with its farcical but well-wrought premise and career-best performances from Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine, never puts a foot wrong.320 18. Miracle on 34th Street (1994)Whether you consider this film a heart-warming gem or an insult to the 1947 original might depend on which version you grew up with – but it’s hard to argue with the performances of Richard Attenborough as Kris Kringle, and Mara Wilson as the precociously cynical Dorey.Film trailer editor Amanda (Cameron Diaz) and wedding columnist Iris (Kate Winslet) exchange homes over Christmas in an attempt to escape their terrible love lives. This Nancy Meyers classic is as predictable as its fake movie trailers, but it’s warm and witty, with a strange but sweet subplot involving an Oscar-winning nonagenarian.A bizarre and macabre Santa Claus origin story, this Finnish fantasy horror follows a group of Lapland natives who stumble upon the secret of Father Christmas. To say that he’s not the cuddly, benevolent gift-giver we know and love would be an understatement.  To say any more would be to spoil the twisted fun.This low-budget, entirely improvised film from “mumblecore” actor-director Joe Swanberg is an understated and underrated gem. Anna Kendrick is typically charismatic as an irresponsible twenty-something who crashes, uninvited, back into the life of her older brother Jeff (Swanberg), but the film’s secret weapon is a brilliantly nuanced performance from Melanie LynskeyFeaturing a reimagined version of the title song, which Bing Crosby introduced in Holiday Inn over a decade earlier, White Christmas was intended to reunite Crosby with Fred Astaire for their third Irving Berlin showcase musical. Astaire declined the project, and eventually Danny Kaye starred instead, as an aspiring entertainer alongside Crosby. The resulting film was a box office smash and a subsequent classic. Astaire missed out.Whatever side you’re on in the infernal debate over whether it’s actually a Christmas movie (Bruce Willis thinks not), it\u0027s hard to deny that Die Hard is a perfect action movie. That it takes place on Christmas Eve, and features lines like, “Now I have a machine gun, ho-ho-ho”, makes it ideal holiday viewing too – particularly if you’re a little sick of festive slush.Based on Robert Nathan’s 1928 novel, The Bishop’s Wife stars Cary Grant as perhaps the most charming angel to ever grace the silver screen. Taking on human form in order to help a struggling bishop (David Niven) and his fractured marriage, Grant’s Dudley accidentally falls in love with the eponymous Julia (Loretta Young). He’s an angel, though, not a homewrecker, and all is well come Christmas Eve.There have been about a hundred screen adaptations of Charles Dickens’s iconic novella, which sees a penny-pinching miser change his ways after encountering the ghosts of his Christmas past, present and future. Though this made-for-television film is far from the most famous reimagining, it is one of the best – thanks in no small part to perfectly pitched performances from Patrick Stewart and Richard E Grant.1120 10. Meet Me in St. Louis (1944)Sick of playing juvenile roles, Judy Garland nearly turned down her role as the lovesick Esther Smith in this musical comedy. When she finally agreed to do it, the production was marred by her erratic behaviour – she would regularly turn up to set hours late, or not turn up at all. “It was some years later before I really knew what she’d been going through,” her co-star Mary Astor later said, alluding to Garland’s struggles with mental health issues and addiction – but you’d never know any of that watching this warm, charming film. It’s also responsible for one of the best Christmas songs ever made: “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas”.Lost in New York (1992): It is a truth universally acknowledged that the Home Alone franchise went on for three films too long – but this first sequel is surprisingly wonderful. Sure, it follows almost the exact same formula as the original, and simply relocates to the Big Apple, but with a formula this good, and with Macaulay Culkin still on board (he wisely bowed out after this one), it’s hard to complain. If you’re after festive cheer, though, you might want to fast forward through Donald Trump’s brief cameo.When it comes to Christmas films, there is no shortage of love and romance – but it’s all overwhelmingly straight. Even Love Actually filmed a queer storyline among its 524 interweaving plots, before deciding it should be cut from the film, leaving that “Colin goes to America” abomination intact. And so Todd Haynes’s Carol, a beautifully shot adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 novel in which department store worker Therese (Rooney Mara) falls in love with a mysterious older woman (Cate Blanchett) in the run up to Christmas, is a welcome break from heteronorm-nativity.We’ve all read that Jezebel article by now, and know that Love Actually is flawed as hell. But there is far too much to enjoy in this ensemble romcom to write it off – namely Emma Thompson’s extraordinary, rightly revered performance as the wronged wife of Alan Rickman.There are three simple rules to keep a gremlin from wreaking havoc: don’t expose it to the light, don’t get it wet, and never feed it after midnight. Naturally, over the course of this Christmas comedy horror, all three of those rules are broken. The ensuing chaos makes for riotous viewing.Who’s have thought that one of the best interpretations of Charles Dickens’s festive fable would come courtesy of a bunch of wise-cracking puppets? In his role as Ebeneezer Scrooge, Michael Caine vowed to act “like I’m working with the Royal Shakespeare Company”, whatever ridiculous antics were happening around him. His tactic worked.Though this beautiful, wordless animation is not widely known outside the UK – it was first broadcast on the then fledgling Channel 4 in 1982 and then annually ever since – it is well worth 26 minutes of anyone’s time. Revolving around a young boy and a snowman come to life (a little like Jack Frost, except not terrible), the film ends with a breathtaking flourish, as the pair fly over England’s snowy plains to the melancholy strains of “Walking in the Air.This fish-out-of-water tale, in which one of Santa’s elves (Will Ferrell) discovers that he’s actually a human and sets out to New York to find his father, could have been supremely annoying if it weren’t for Ferrell’s absolute commitment to his ludicrous role. Bolstered by strong performances from James Caan, Mary Steenburgen and Zooey Deschanel, Elf manages to be both self-aware and defiantly uncynical.After revelling for a while in every child’s ill-thought-out fantasy – “I made my family disappear,” says Macaulay Culkin’s Kevin when his family accidentally leave on holiday without him – Home Alone then promptly changes tack, inserting two grimy burglars into the mix. Cue some of the most inventive, and surprisingly violent, self-defence techniques you’ve ever seen.Admittedly, for about 120 of this film’s 130-minute running time, it’s really not a wonderful life at all. In fact, this tale of a down-on-his-luck bank clerk (James Stewart) driven to the brink of suicide, before a trainee angel shows him what the world would have been like without him (spoiler: much worse), is deeply emotionally draining. But it’s also warm, funny, timeless, life-affirming, and a deserved classic.When Tim Allen’s Scott Calvin accidentally kills Santa Claus (a nice, light-hearted beginning to a family film) he is expected to take his place.

If you’re after festive cheer, though, you might want to fast forward through Donald Trump’s brief cameo.When it comes to Christmas films, there is no shortage of love and romance – but it’s all overwhelmingly straight. Even Love Actually filmed a queer storyline among its 524 interweaving plots, before deciding it should be cut from the film, leaving that “Colin goes to America” abomination intact. And so Todd Haynes’s Carol, a beautifully shot adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 novel in which department store worker Therese (Rooney Mara) falls in love with a mysterious older woman (Cate Blanchett) in the run up to Christmas, is a welcome break from heteronorm-nativity.We’ve all read that Jezebel article by now, and know that Love Actually is flawed as hell. But there is far too much to enjoy in this ensemble romcom to write it off – namely Emma Thompson’s extraordinary, rightly revered performance as the wronged wife of Alan Rickman.There are three simple rules to keep a gremlin from wreaking havoc: don’t expose it to the light, don’t get it wet, and never feed it after midnight. Naturally, over the course of this Christmas comedy horror, all three of those rules are broken. The ensuing chaos makes for riotous viewing.Who’s have thought that one of the best interpretations of Charles Dickens’s festive fable would come courtesy of a bunch of wise-cracking puppets? In his role as Ebeneezer Scrooge, Michael Caine vowed to act “like I’m working with the Royal Shakespeare Company”, whatever ridiculous antics were happening around him. His tactic worked.Though this beautiful, wordless animation is not widely known outside the UK – it was first broadcast on the then fledgling Channel 4 in 1982 and then annually ever since – it is well worth 26 minutes of anyone’s time. Revolving around a young boy and a snowman come to life (a little like Jack Frost, except not terrible), the film ends with a breathtaking flourish, as the pair fly over England’s snowy plains to the melancholy strains of “Walking in the Air.This fish-out-of-water tale, in which one of Santa’s elves (Will Ferrell) discovers that he’s actually a human and sets out to New York to find his father, could have been supremely annoying if it weren’t for Ferrell’s absolute commitment to his ludicrous role. Bolstered by strong performances from James Caan, Mary Steenburgen and Zooey Deschanel, Elf manages to be both self-aware and defiantly uncynical.After revelling for a while in every child’s ill-thought-out fantasy – “I made my family disappear,” says Macaulay Culkin’s Kevin when his family accidentally leave on holiday without him – Home Alone then promptly changes tack, inserting two grimy burglars into the mix. Cue some of the most inventive, and surprisingly violent, self-defence techniques you’ve ever seen.Admittedly, for about 120 of this film’s 130-minute running time, it’s really not a wonderful life at all. In fact, this tale of a down-on-his-luck bank clerk (James Stewart) driven to the brink of suicide, before a trainee angel shows him what the world would have been like without him (spoiler: much worse), is deeply emotionally draining. But it’s also warm, funny, timeless, life-affirming, and a deserved classic.Along with her three starring roles in the film, Hudgens has apparently signed on to produce, as well.\u0026nbspThe Princess Switch: Switched Again\u0026nbspis the latest Christmas film Hudgens has signed on for.

But the flag was glaring through half-closed blinds at a California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation building near downtown Sacramento, prompting outrage at the open exhibition of one of the world’s most famous hate symbols on public, government-owned property.“That’s cute, that’s real cute, City of Sacramento, letting people like that work in your state buildings,” said one passerby, adding an expletive, in a video of the office window he uploaded to Imgur.The caption reads:\u0026nbsp”This is a trashy way to represent this beautiful city, especially in a state building.”Created with Sketch.Nazi-themed satirical toilet roll goes under the hammer Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The flag hung above a pair of SS bolts, a white supremacist symbol inspired by Nazi Germany’s police force, and other symbols of hate, said Michael Johnson, the man who local media said made the video, which has been viewed tens of thousands of times.“You didn’t have to be close to the building at all,” Mr Johnson told TV outlet KTLA. “People driving by could see it.”Mr Johnson said he took the video on Friday night.

But the voters will not forget this treachery.EX-POLICING minister Sir Mike Penning’s discovery that he could easily obtain lethal knives online using  data is shocking.As he said, this wasn’t so much a loophole in the law but a “giant chasm”.Home Secretary Priti Patel must stem the flood of such weapons, while Amazon should face severe penaltiesit has failed to police its online adverts.Knives are fuelling a spate of murders of our young people. We must do everything possible to protect the next generation.THE England rugby team’s magnicent victory over the All Blacks was simply stunning.Their grit, ambition and fair play should set an example to our politicians.We wish Wales well in their vital clash today against the mighty Springboks.What better way to unite the nation than to see an all-UK World Cup final on Saturday SPEAKING of good news, no matter how gloomy you are feeling about the Brexit stalemate and the dismal weather, you can always look forward to Thursday.Let’s hope that whoever gets the job understands better than Mr Bercow that the Speaker should work for the country.Not try to run it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has already put himself out for hire for £, in recent days.Bercow whines he is “entitled to make a living”, and after ten shouty years on the globally screened Parliament Channel he has achieved lucrative star status.As cartoon TV hero Homer Simpson has proved, audiences love grotesques.Once free from high office, Bercow can quickly fill his boots with fees worth tens of thousands a time.But could there be another motive for his decision to go now rather than after he has completely screwed Brexit Had he stayed on, it seems he risked being “tried” on incendiary allegations of bullying and bringing Parliament into disrepute — an offence which might have cost him an automatic peerage and a seat in the House of Lords.Once out, he is “beyond the jurisdiction of Parliament”.Bercow has been haunted for years by allegations of volcanic temper tantrums and humiliation of staff, including some of the Commons’ most senior officials. He denies all the claims.Official probes have been shamelessly stymied by Labour because of Bercow’s “Bollocks to Brexit” stance.Labour grandee Dame Margaret Beckett blurted out her party’s motives, insisting Bercow must stay because Brexit “trumps bad behaviour”.The hypocrisy stinks. Labour claims to be the workers’ party. Here it is standing up for the bosses’ class.Parliament has also been criticised for failing victims of bullying. But kicking these charges into touch seems to have worked.Bercow’s decision to go now has persuaded former Black Rod David Leakey and the Speaker’s ex-Private Secretary, Angus Sinclair, to abandon claims of humiliation and abuse.In  Mr Sinclair, hardened by  years before the mast, told BBC Newsnight that Bercow mimicked him and was “prone to over-the-top anger”.Mr Leakey, an ex-Army Lieutenant-General, spoke of “the red mist descending” as Bercow “banged the table, yelled and was highly insulting to me personally”.He warns the Sundaythat a Bercow peerage would bring the House of Lords into disrepute at a time when politicians’ reputations are already at an all-time low.“Whatever Bercow’s merits as Speaker, I believe he should be treated in the same way as any other successful but disreputable citizen of the country,” says Leakey.“He is disreputable because, as a high-profile public figure, he has set an appalling example to the country, not least in publicly demeaning MPs in the chamber and on television.“As a senior figure in any other organisation, his behaviour would likely have resulted in investigation, censure or even dismissal.“He should not be rewarded with ‘baubles’ or a peerage.”Having watched this snarling, purple-faced Mr Punch discredit the constitution, stain the reputation of Parliament and demean the most distinguished post in British politics, it is impossible to disagree.There is now a chance for MPs to clean out this soiled stable and restore Parliament’s reputation.Decent Labour MP and popular Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle is front-runner for the job. But none of the candidates could be worse, even preachy Labour veteran Harriet Harman.To quote the former Black Rod, it should not be rewarded by any party with an unelected place on the overstuffed red benches of the House of Lords.BREXIT-cancelling Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson thinks we are all stupid.Her plot with the SNP to stage a snap election on Monday, December , has flashing red lights all over it.It would be a vehicle for oddball amendments including votes at  – just the impressionable age when fantasy politics appeals most.She pretends she is trying to stop Boris “crashing out” with No Deal.Yet Boris wants a deal.

And soon, his poisonous ideology may be stamped out for good.IN a simpering interview yesterday, Justin Welby made a dig at Boris Johnson for “pouring petrol” on the isions of our country.Not for the first time, the interfering Archbishop has got it all wrong.It is not the Prime Minister who has torn Britain apart, but a small group of Remainers refusing to honour that vital principle underpinning democracy: losers’ consent.It was them and their MPs who instigated all this and who now — via their deranged campaign for a “people’s vote” — are blocking all progress on the Prime Minister’s pragmatic and sensible deal.The Remoaner Archbishop is part of the problem.Time he stopped meddling in politics and got back to his dwindling flock.IT is appalling that John Bercow — who steps down later this week — has been allowed to get away without being investigated over grave allegations of bullying.There is a new rule allowing investigations into grievance claims by ex staff, but oh so conveniently, it comes too late for the current Speaker.Shocking though it should be, this establishment stitch up is no surprise.Labour MPs happily propped up weaselling Bercow when he was inventing precedents willy-nilly to aid their Remoaner cause.ButMPs think that voters haven’t noticed what’s been going on, they’re living in cloud cuckoo land.An election is round the corner, and our useless MPs are in for a rude awakening.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

If you run away or say anything about what happened to you, then they’re going to deport you back to your country, Laura Durán, of the charity Every Child Protected Against TraffickingUK, tells Sun Online.With nail salons now a staple on Britains high streets, offering plenty of low-skilled labour roles, its perhaps unsurprising that many Vietnamese people see them as a ticket to a better le.But this makes them easy prey for vile trafficking networks, who are thought to illegally smuggle around , Vietnamese citizens including children, to Europe each year.They lure their desperate victims with  promises of lucrative jobs in cash-only nail bars and cannabis farms, assuring them they can change their own and their familys fortunes.The sick trade has become so prevalent that over the past decade a holding camp in Northern France has been dubbed Vietnam City, based on the huge number of Vietnamese migrants waiting to reach Britain.My family back paid someone and they got me this far, a Vietnamese man at another refugee camp, located slightly further north, told The Sun on Sunday.“People in England will get me a job when I get there. It’s scary when you think what happened [in Essex] but that’s the chance you take and I am ready to risk my le.Pham Thi Tra My, , texted her mum, Im dying because I cant breatheFor migrants with enough le savings, they can buy a VIP trip to the UK - which costs nearly £, and involves a flight on someone s passport, or a doctored diplomatic one, to Europe.Or the cheaper option - so-called grass packages costing up to £, - involves a less direct route to Europe that can take several months and hundreds of miles on foot and by road.Often, migrants first travel to China or Russia before moving West entered Russia as tourists, with many then travelling to Western Europe.Other popular connecting countries including France, Germany and Poland.They go through jungles, forests and theyre kept in wooden huts, immigration lawyer Harjap Bhangal tells Sun Online, describing a migrants typical, dangerous journey to Britain.The gangs are ruthless. If someone is slowing down the group the smugglers will kill them.While Vietnam as a whole has seen a reduction in poverty, not all regions have been affected equally - so the majority of migrants come from a select few poor provinces.In Nghe An and Ha Tinh - where many lorry victims are feared to be from - the countryside is dotted with billboards for labour export firms advertising jobs or study overseas.Almost everyone round here has a relative overseas, local Bui Thac, whose nephew Bui Phan Thang is suspected to be among those found dead last week, told Reuters.Young people must find ways to work abroad because its dficult to work at home.For those who survive the horror passage to Britain, their nightmares far from over.While plenty of the countrys nail salons and grooming parlours are reputable businesses, police say the industry has become a hotbed of labour exploitation.Labour exploitation in nail bars is one of the most prevalent areas of modern day slavery in the UK, Hardeep Walker, of the National Crime Agency , told our Stamp Out Slavery campaign this year.He added: The salon conditions are usually quite small and cramped and can have a strong smell of chemicals. The exploiter will be present in the salon, often acting as a front of house member of staff who meets and greets customers and takes payment whilst keeping a watchful eye over the workers.Even when their sht is finally over, the workers have no escape - because they tend to sleep in rooms above or attached to salons, and have no money of their own to spend.Slavery takes a iety of forms, but most commonly forced labour, sexual exploitation, domestic work or forced criminal activity. The Home Office estimated that there are , people held in slavery in the UK, with the Global Slavery Index suggesting the figure could be as many as ,.The UK recognised a staggering , victims from  countries in , including adults who had been used for organ harvesting and children that were forced into sexual exploitation.Our Stamp Out Slavery campaign, in conjunction with Co-op, has highlighted the plight of some of Britains slaves working in car washes and nail salons, farms and factories all over the UK.We called on the government to extend support for Britains slaves beyond the current -day limit and backing Lord McColls private members Bill demanding support be extended to a year.In April this year, a high court judge suspended the paltry time limit and said it should be subject to a full judicial review.In , two Bath nail bar owners were locked up for five and four years respectively in a landmark case, after forcing young Vietnamese women to work for no pay in UK salons.Thu Huong Nguyen and Viet Hoany Nguyen trafficked the girls between salons according to demand and exploited them in plain sight, the Crown Prosecution Servicesaid.But while they didnt pay one victim - with a second earning just £ a month - a search of Thu Huong Nguyens home uncovered £, in £ notes hidden inside a teddy bear.The same year,  nail salons were raided by police across London, Cardf and Edinburgh, resulting in  arrests, in a bid to tackle the epidemic.It came six years after the extradition of gangster Do Huan Nguyen, who smuggled more than  Vietnamese people to the UK to work in drug factories and nail salons.Last year, more than  potential victims of trafficking from Vietnam were identied, ECPAT tells Sun Online - although the real number is far higher because most go undocumented.Today, many victims continue to work in exploitative British nail salons, often avoiding eye contact and conversationas they apply coats of glossy polish.But these salons floor-to-ceiling windows and bright lights provide a colourful cover for a dark, sickening secret.What do employees look like What do they sound like How do you feel Souce: UnseenOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Harry and Meghan went to Africa, with ITV, and made that trip all about their own anxieties and issues as well, without being half as engaging or sympathetic as Scarlett Moffatt.If anything, I think The British Tribe Next Door will also live longer in my memory than the royal version, not least because C seems to have got more than it bargained for with the Himba, who clearly aren’t big on marital fidelity.Some of the men are already looking to pick off Scarlett from the back of the Moffatt herd and episode one ended with this tantalising offer, from one of the women to her mum.“Betty, let us swap husbands tonight.” .So my interest in this show is now over.DAVID ATTENBOROUGH’S Seven Worlds, One Planet lived up to the usual visually stunning expectations for nearly an hour on Sunday night on BBC.A couple of cute baby animals won their struggle for le, two gender-fluid gastropods had it off at the bottom of the Antarctic Ocean and a bull elephant seal on South Georgia discovered: “cm of blubber is protection against the cold, but not from a four-ton opponent” – a bit like Tess Holliday did when Piers Morgan went for her on Twitter.The environmental message was also conveyed, in no uncertain terms, as the seas warmed, glaciers melted and an albatross chick almost got blown to buggery.Then,  minutes into the show, we were suddenly back on South Georgia, with Rolf the seasick cameraman, who was in front of the lens this time and so overcome by the fate of the penguins, and the future of the planet, he began sobbing like Rylan Clark-Neal just after Nicole Scherzinger had put him through to live shows.All the most pointless, virtue-signalling extinction rebels in the country were probably joining in with this gesture as well, even though it’s a moot point as to how close we are exactly to environmental Armageddon.What you can say with a little more certainty, though, is that the moment it starts trying to turn a David Attenborough documentary into an X Factor sob story it’s probably the beginning of the end for the BBC.THE Last Leg, Adam Hills: “Out of ­interest, what would we all dothis ­fabulous industry we’re in fell through for us and we had to go and find a job ”Have you ever considered comedy X Factor: Celebrity, Jenny Ryan: “It’s time for me to share what I’ve got with the world.”Jonathan Ross: “He’s the host of the very funny Mash Report. He’s a fabulous stand-up, Nish Kumar.”And X Factor: Celebrity, Simon Cowell to No Love Lost: “For all the doubters who thought this was going to be a car crash, you’ve proved a point.”It’s a car crash.Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “The term Martians refers to the supposed inhabitants of which planet ”Lucie: “Pass.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “What Champion­ship team was originally called The Wednesday Football Club ”Orchid: “Tottenham Spurs.”Ben Shephard: “Which th Century military conflict is also known as The Great War ”Ben Shephard: “In a classic novel by Johanna Spyri, what is the name of the orphan sent to live with her grandfather in the Swiss Alps ”Steph: “Anne Frank.”CHANNEL  disclaimer of the week: “Be prepared right from the very start for graphic scenes of consensual bondage, sadomasochism, dominant and submissive sexual activity, dangerous procedures which only trained professionals should try, nudity and offensive language, all of which are likely to disturb some viewers.”And what an episode of Toot The Tiny Tugboat that was.SATURDAY’S first live episode of X Factor: Celebrity was an assault on two of your senses.The show now looks like it’s set in the display ring of a Herefordshire livestock market, but sounds more like the local abattoir during “Sunday roast” rush hour.Seriously, you dub Jenny Ryan or Ricki Lake singing Stevie Nicks’ Landslide, over a Peta video, the whole country would turn vegan by Monday morning.The miracle of the night, though, was BBC Religion Editor Martin Bashir, who was comfortably worse than both those two and sang like he’d been grabbed nuts-first backstage by Vinnie Jones, yet still got saved by Cowell and Nicole Scherzinger ahead of an understandably inconsolable Olivia Olson.The explanation, I think, lies in the fact Martin brings the precious gt of comedy to X Factor: Celebrity, hopping and skipping across the stage, in his Harold Lloyd get-up, to an old Bert Kaempfert classic.It presented a critical problem, though, for the clearly smitten Cowell, who’d been on the verge of saying the wrong thing all night, but provided the perfect assist on this occasion.“If you recognise that song . . .”Then seriously well done and Danke Schoen, Martin.TV GOLD: Will Sharpe’s scene-stealing performance as Rodney the rent boy in BBC’s engrossing drama Giri Haji.The albatross chick hauling itself back on to a nest and a penguin seal stand-off, from BBC’s Seven Worlds, One Planet.

In post-Brexit Britain, the key swing voter is “Workington Man” — a typically white man over  who didn’t go to university and voted to Leave.Until recently he was dyed-in-the-wool Labour. Corbyn’s neglect of the working class means he might, for the first time, vote Tory.To win him round, the Conservatives must promise more than the economic freedoms and tax giveaways they are known for.They need to offer protection from a modern world in which liberalising economic policies, globalisation and immigration have undermined work, wages and community.Nearly three in four voters think it has become harder for people like them to make a decent living, so any manesto worth its salt will put ending low pay and insecure work at its heart.For the half of school leavers who lag behind without degrees, the Conservatives should ert funding from low quality university degrees towards technical education.The Tories also need to reassess their long-held devotion to tax cuts. While the cost of living is a problem, the level of taxation doesn’t seem to be.Two thirds of people want investment in the NHS, schools and social care rather than income tax cuts. This may be because households are squeezed more by rent, commuting and childcare than taxes.But people simply don’t believe politicians any more when they offer tax cuts. Instead, the Brexit idend should be focused on improving AEs and classrooms.Building local nurseries, bringing empty and foreign-owned homes into use, and boosting family budgets will win votes.Most of all, the Conservatives need to restore a greater sense of belonging.Think of your own town — the high street is probably in disrepair, libraries and buses have gone, pubs and post offices are closing. Crime is everyone’s concern. The social fabric is fraying and people feel it.New funding for high streets and towns is a start, but why not help communities take over post offices, pubs and football clubs when they go out of business, as we do for schools, or introduce a national civic service for school leavers Labour’s abiding strength is the basic sense that their politics is about looking out for others.But Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour cares more about ending control of immigration and re-running the  referendum than protecting working people.This is the only way he can reach into Labour’s heartlands to win seats like Wigan, Dewsbury and Workington, places that seek security and community over freedom and inidualism.Workington has never ed a Conservative MP in a general election.

Let’s hope history doesn’t repeat itself.For the past three years, our useless political class has pulled every trick to try to stop Brexit. PM Boris Johnson, desperate to end the gridlock, has now shamed these democracy-blockers into holding a general election. It’s a risky move.The electoral system is skewed against the Conservatives. Butopinion polls are right — andBoris can inspire ­voters with his optimism and brio — Brexit really might be unblocked by Christmas. At last!Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, after weeks of political constipation, took a dose of prune juice yesterday and, amazingly, reached a decision. Did you see his face afterwards  Pure relief. He hadn’t been that happy for months.Finally he had seen off the shroud-waving, do-nothing, block-everything Blairite Remainers in his parliamentary party — among them his ­deputy, Tom Watson.They had wanted to keep commie Corbyn swinging in the wind for a few more months. They were still ­moaning last night that he had blown this anti-Brexit ­Parliament’s last chance of securing a second referendum.Corbyn’s repeated refusals to go to the country were making him look like a politician who was scared of the people. Reaction on the doorsteps to his indecision was terrible. No wonder he finally caved.Butthe Labour leader ­yesterday seemed liberated, there were plenty on his ­Commons benches who were aghast at the idea of an ­election in December.“It’ll be too dark!” they wailed. “It’ll be too cold! People will be too busy preparing for Christmas! The students won’t be at university any more!”Too dark and too cold  Does that mean we should only ever have general elections in high summer It was even put about that Cabinet Secretary Sir Mark Sedwill had advised Boris against calling a mid- December election because church halls would have been booked for school nativity plays.Now I’m as soft as any ­doting dad about kiddies dressing up to play Joseph and Mary but sorry, a general ­election to free our country from this Brexit impasse really might be more important.Why were some MPs so ­miserable yesterday  Most obviously, it was because lots of them think they’ll lose their seats. Anyone with a majority of fewer than , will ­probably be feeling twitchy, particularlyhe or she spent the last three years resisting the ­public’s will on Brexit.Money was another factor. Fighting an election is ­expensive for MPs. They not only lose their Westminster income once ­Parliament is dissolvedbut they also have to dig into their pockets for expenses and ­election costs.All those leaflets, all that petrol and shoe leather, all those late-night takeaways with volunteers — the sums soon add up. A Tory MP once told me that an election campaign cost him £,.But Parliament needs rebooting. At the  election, both Labour and the Conservatives promised to respect the Leave vote — and they duly won most of the seats.But Labour broke that ­promise, as the antics of ­Corbyn, Keir Starmer, Hilary Benn and Co showed. Leave voters in Labour seats are less likely to be fooled a second time.The one unknown in the election will be Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party. Could it yet lose the election for Boris by taking votes away from the pro-Brexit Tories  What an own goal that would be.Ben Bradshaw, arch- Remainer Labour MP for Exeter, called yesterday’s ­election moves “outrageous”. We were at a “critical juncture for our country”. He plainly thought that only MPs should have a say.Keep the unwashed voters where they belong, eh, Ben  Barry Sheerman, another Remainer Labour MP, professed himself “puzzled and deeply disappointed” by Corbyn’s support for an election.Sheerman feared “the elderly” would not be able to get to polling stations on a December day. Mr Sheerman himself is . If we all took his patronising attitude, we might ask how the old dearie manages to totter down to Westminster from his Huddersfield constituency every week.At such an advanced age, how does Barry remember to tie his laces, let alone make his terrible speeches in the Commons  But no one does ask that, thank goodness, because we do not treat older people like ­simpletons.On Monday Labour MP Seema Malhotra fretted about students losing their right to vote in a December election because they might have ended their college terms by then and have moved back home.  She called this “voter ­suppression”.Oh come off it.

Their “people’s vote” would be history.Boris will then pump billions into our police, schools and NHS and keep taxes low enough to carry on creating jobs, as the Tories have since .Corbyn is the least popular political leader in UK history. A dangerous fool loathed even by many Labour MPs.Some have repeatedly denounced him as an anti-Jewish racist, yet they will now knock on doors urging voters to put him in Downing Street. Their “principles” were always a pose.As things stand Corbyn is only likely to win power with the connivance of the Lib Dems and SNP.Which means both a second Brexit referendum — unless they simply order him to revoke Article  — and a second Scottish independence referendum. A Corbyn era would guarantee horric ision for years.That’s before you consider the economic meltdown inevitable in installing a Marxist in Downing Street — impacting everyone’s job, home, savings and pension.Or the chilling threat to ­national security of a hard-left anti-nuclear pacist who considers Britain’s terrorist enemies his “friends”.That’s why Labour tried in vain today to secure votes for children and EU citizens. But polls don’t tell the whole story.Each seat will be split on Leave Remain lines as well as Tory Labour Lib Dem. Those the Tories could lose are easier to pinpoint than the dozens of new ones they must win.Nigel Farage has a huge decision. Only a Boris majority will deliver Brexit. The Brexit Party can be a help or a hindrance. If Boris loses, Brexit is lost too.He has no majority to fend them off or to govern. Parliament is beyond repair.

After two years of Parliamentary battles and a souring of politics, more than  MPs have decided to call it a day and not stand again. Some - like longest-serving MP Ken Clarke and Sir Winston Churchillaposs grandson Nicholas Soames - are retiring after decades of service. But others have decided the venom and anger around Brexit are making them want to call it a day. Those include ex-Tory, ex-Change UK Lib Dem Heidi Allen - who says public le has been utterly dehumanising. Meanwhile Speaker John Bercow is finally calling it a day after nearly a decade in the grand chair in the House of Commons. Hereaposs the full list of MPs whoaposve announced they are standing down so far.  When people talk about “Tory Big Beasts”, the image they have in their head is -year-old Ken Clarke. The Rushclfe MP holds the title of ‘father of the house’ - which means he’s the longest serving MP, having been sworn in a few minutes earlier than Labour ’s Dennis Skinner. And he’s been a cabinet minister under three successive Tory Prime Ministers - Education Secretary under Margaret Thatcher, Home Secretary and Chancellor under John Major and Justice Secretary under David Cameron. In fact, he was one of only five ministers to serve throughout the whole of the  years of Tory governments led by Thatcher and Major. He’s socially and economically liberal, and has been president of the Tory Reform Group since . And he’s perhaps been the Conservative Party’s proudest and most prominent pro-European voices for several decades. He had the Tory whip removed weeks before finally standing down for voting to block a no-deal Brexit. John Bercow  Commons Speaker John Bercow announced in September that he would stand down. He developed a reputation for standing up for MPsapos rights against the government - granting more emergency debates and urgent questions in the Commons. But he later faced fierce criticism from Brexiteers, who questioned his impartiality on the issue of Europe. The ex-Tory MP succeeded the late Michael Martin as Speaker in . Amber Rudd  Ms Ruddaposs departure means the House of Commons will lose one of its most prominent anti-hard-Brexit MPs. She resigned as DWP Secretary in solidarity with  Tories who lost the whip in September. Yet she also had changed her position in the past, moving from vowing to block a no-deal Brexit to saying it would have to be left open as an option. Born in London in , she was the fourth child of stockbroker Tony Rudd and magistrate Ethne Fitzgerald. She went to Cheltenham Ladiesapos College and Queenaposs College in London before reading History at Edinburgh University. She married the writer A.A. Gill and the couple had two children together in the s but later orced. Gill, who died in , referred to Rudd as aposthe Silver Spoonapos in his reviews and she was an aristocracy advisor to Four Weddings And A Funeral. Ms Rudd was forced to resign as Home Secretary over the Windrush scandal after she misled MPs by denying removal targets existed.

Someone made and sold a faulty fridge-freezer, which created the first sparks. Someone installed cladding which did not meet building regulations. Someone did not check whether it met building regulations. Someone decided that it did.More than one person, in more than one organisation, ignored years of repeated warnings from firefighters, fire chiefs, and fire experts that such cladding was lethal.Someone ordered a refurbishment of Grenfell Tower that destroyed its ability to contain a fire. There were missing fire doors and gaps in the walls that allowed smoke to fill the single staircase, cutting off the only route of escape.Someone did not bother to ask the fire brigade to check the refurbishment was safe.    The Grenfell Tower inquiry findings being reported today are about what happened on the night of the fire, on June , . It found the fire brigade command was confused and erratic. That juniors stuck to rules about telling people to stay put for an hour after they should have been evacuated. That while its firefighters were selfless heroes who repeatedly ran into an inferno with little hope of finding anyone alive, its training, resources and instructions were woeful. As the Fire Brigades Union has said, there is no evidence that  firefighters could have evacuated  people down a single, smoke-logged, stairwell. And as one relative pointed out, the fire went out only when there was nothing left to burn. But Dany Cotton said something , which only the shockingly callous would ignore: No building had ever behaved like that. No building ever should.   When the first  calls said the fire was burning DOWN the building, the emergency operators didnapost think it was possible.When firefighters arrived, they couldnapost believe their eyes. Their hoses didnapost reach even halfway up, and burning plastic rained down upon them, and thousands of eyewitnesses. Hundreds of adults and children watched their loved ones burn. They lost their lives, too, with the added burden of having to live with it. An emergency service that makes emergencies worse when it turns up is no use to anyone. But the fire brigade should never have been called. That tower should never have burned in the first place.    It should have had fire doors and sprinklers. The refurbishment should have added a second fire escape. The cladding should have been banned. The coroner who ruled the deaths of  people in the Lakanal House fire  years earlier were due to cladding and the stay put policy should have been listened to. Fire chiefs who realised a  blaze in Shepherds Bush spread via the cladding, and who wrote to every council in London warning them, should have been heeded.The British Standards Instituteaposs seventh annual fire conference in , at which the government fire safety adviser was present, should have paid attention when it heard evidence that gaps between the cladding and the walls created a wind tunnel, and that a tragedy was inevitable.Every council housing officer, every building regs inspector, every contractor and politician should have noticed dozens of cladding fires on towers worldwide, and acted to ensure it did not happen here. The Grenfell residents who raised concerns should have been heard, before they burned.    Instead, laws stipulating all external walls in the capital should have an hour of fire resistance were scrapped in .Instead, communities secretary Eric Pickles ordered a review of building regulations in  that didnapost happen. In , housing minister Brandon Lewis refused to make sprinklers mandatory, saying: The cost of fitting a fire sprinkler system may affect house building – something we want to encourage.Instead, the Mayor of London axed £million,  fire stations,  fire engines and  firefighters from his fire service. When a consultation found % of those asked were against the cuts, he ignored it. He over-ruled opposition on the London Assembly, and when asked how he could possibly still call this reduction in fire cover an improvement he told his questioner to get stuffed.That Mayor is now Prime Minister. And flammable cladding is still on more than , tower blocks, hospitals, schools and homes, nationwide.   There are , people still living in torches created by cuts and callousness that emanated from those in ivory towers, who show little care for those who live in concrete ones. Fire service funding across England was cut by % between  and , and it has been slashed again this year.Two years after Grenfell, the stay put policy is staying put. It has not been reviewed. The advice today, in another cladding fire, would still be to stay in your flat and pray you donapost burn. No-one has been prosecuted. Those someones have not been identied. The rules have been tweaked but not changed, new cladding is banned but old stuff is not, and firefighter jobs are still being snuffed out as though what they do is of no import. Some survivors are still homeless. All are still suffering.  Theresa May avoided Grenfell survivors for as long as she could before ordering an inquiry thoughtfully split into two parts, so that it would roast the firefighters first. Phase , about who is responsible for the blaze, will not begin until next year.A police investigation, manned by  officers, is ongoing while those leading it say there is no guarantee anyone will ever be charged.Had it been a tower of million-pound penthouses that burned, you can bet your house someone would be serving time for it by now.But as far as the government, the authorities, the criminal justice system, and the Prime Minister are concerned, there is no reason to do anything they have done dferently.

The Conservatives have staked their fortunes on the popularity of their Brexit message and the unpopularity of Jeremy Corbyn. The Labour leader, in perhaps his best performance at the Despatch Box, gave them cause to worry on both fronts. Firstly, he deliberately avoided Brexit and focused on the NHS in all six of his questions. Secondly, he showed that he could be a far more formidable opponent that the Conservatives have assumed. The calling of the election appears to have taken a weight off Corbyn’s shoulders.  He was more comfortable and sharper than he has been in ages. In the past he has noticeably failed to pick Theresa May and Boris Johnson up for any inaccuracies or unsubstantiated claims. Today he was whippet like in the way he corrected the Prime Minister on his misleading promise to build  new hospitals and his summary of the NHS in Labour-run Wales. The Conservatives should also be concerned at the contrast between the empathetic way Corbyn can speak about those who use our public services and their leader’s blustering answers. The Labour leader calmly used his questions to note the failings of the NHS under the Tories from the record rise in the number of patients waiting for an operation to the delays in cancer treatment. At one point Johnson was so lost for an answer he resorted to accusing the Labour leader of “talking down the incredible work” of NHS staff.

The boy suffered a brain injury at birth after his delivery by emergency Caesarean at a top London hospital was delayed. After his birth at University College Hospital in June , he had to be resuscitated and cooled for  hours in an effort to protect his brain. A court dealing with the case heard the north London boyaposs behaviour since his birth had led him to be branded naughty and disruptive. According to the law firm representing the boyaposs family, he presents just like any other child, but throughout his short le has exhibited grossly abnormal behaviour. His mum and dad had been accused of being aposbad parentsapos by social services and health professionals working with the boy throughout years of misdiagnosis.    The familyaposs local authority had struggled to place him in a school due to his shouting, biting, defiance and impulsiveness. The boyaposs outbursts are so frequent he requires two support workers at all times, and he has been excluded from school almost every day. He currently lives with his parents and siblings in their north London home and attends a nurturing unit in a specialist school with his own support workers. His father also looks after the boyaposs mother, who is in a wheelchair. When the mum saw how poor her babyaposss condition was after birth, she suffered severe shock. He suffered a Moderate neonatal encephalopathy, signs of respiratory distress, neo-natal hypoglycaemia, sepsis, seizures and persistent pulmonary hypertension.    A High Court judge on Monday approved a settlement of £million for the boy, after a law firm brought a medical negligence claim on behalf of his family. Fieldfisher Partner Jane Weakley said the family had suffered five years of misdiagnosis following the birth. Without it, he and his parents would likely continue to have been blamed for his behaviour throughout his le, she added. Iaposm extremely pleased that this settlement for le will allow his family to provide the best possible care to give this child the best le possible. What he thrives on is being outdoors, with space to run around in and areas to explore. But he does need two support workers with him at all times to handle his volatile outbursts. His family love him dearly and I know theyaposll do the absolute best for him.

It is a familiar scenario for couples across the UK - they ask their beloved to do something and their other half conveniently aposdoesnapost hearapos what is said. During the course of a typical week, men aposwonapost hearapos what their partner is saying on seven occasions -  times a year in total. In comparison, women will opt aposnot to listenapos just six times-a-week or  times-a-year. However annoying, experts at Scrivens Hearing Care, marking Hearing Awareness Month, warn this could be more than simple aposlazinessapos - and could be more worrying.

Thataposs why regular hearing checks are so important.    A third of the , adults polled said their partner had appeared to be trying to read their lips because they cannot make out what is being said - a common sign of hearing loss. Similarly,  per cent admitted their other half has a tendency to mumble - another indicator of possible hearing problems. The inabitilty to hear consonants is also a symptom of hearing dficulties, with more than a quarter saying their partner has demonstrated signs of this. Six in  said their spouse also has a tendency to watch TV or listen to the radio with the volume turned up high.  And a third revealed their beloved frequently has to resort to asking others to speak more slowly, clearly and loudly.

The -year-old claims that fully identying as a cat means she is finally herself and has also brought her closer to her partner. Model Kat works at Cat Girl Manor – a residence in Colorado Springs which hosts animal roleplay in BDSM events. She met her partner Robrecht Berg, , an aerospace engineer at Comic Con eight months ago. The couple, from Colorado, insist they are in a loving relationship, despite the judgement they face for being in both an age gap and role play relationship.    Kat and Robrecht claim that the pet play has brought them closer. Rob, speaking of the time he first met Kat, said: “She might have been wearing ears at the time but I didnapost notice that that much – not until later talking to her on Messenger I found out that she was more into the kitten side of things and did that regularly since she was a teenager.” Rob, who works as an artist and organises annual Cosplay events, said that he wasn’t shocked about Kat’s role play and is very supportive of his partner’s lestyle choice. He added: This is the same as cosplayers – people do what they like to do. Although the BDSM role play was something he had never tried before, which he describes as neat.    Rob added: “Iaposm very exploratory and I just love trying new things, doing new things, finding new experiences out there and really have pushed into that and enjoyed it with Kat.” Kat said that expressing her cat identity has brought her closer to her partner and has finally enabled her to become her true self. She added: “I have always been dferent. I just always had a fascination with cats and I felt myself, Iaposm a cat. “I go through le being a cat – itaposs just who I am.” Kat claims she realised she was a cat when she was a teenager and has identied as a feline since she was in high school.    She said: “Iaposve always worn cat ears. “It started when I was in high school, I donapost remember exactly what age I was but it [came from] an anime. “I was like, ‘Oh, thataposs cool. I want to be that in real leapos. So I just started applying that to my real le. “I donapost think I started the ears, tail, the collar and all that stuff until later on in le. I was bullied a lot for wearing the ears and just being a nerd. “So I kind of kept it a little bit hidden.” Kat decided to embrace her kitten identity when she came across the Cat Girl Manor kittens and eventually discovered others who identied as cats.    She said: “I just saw other girls doing it, so I felt more comfortable doing it myself.” Kat opened up to Rob about her le as a cat at the very beginning of their relationship. He said: “Everyone has something dferent that they do. “I see it as another outlet for a person to enjoy, relax, be themselves and be creative.” Speaking of their sexual le as a couple, Rob added: “We experiment quite a bit on the sexual side. “Itaposs one of the things that possible experimentation areas. Pet play was something new to me that Kat introduced me to.    “I was willing to be experimental and try new things. The master side of it, not as comfortable with but willing to do that a little bit too.” In their relationship, Kat mostly takes a submissive role and considers Rob as her “master. But she stresses she gets a lot of pleasure from it. She said: “I like wearing the collar every day – a collar to represent just him being owned by him.” Rob added: “We do have the freedom to be fun and not worry about things so much. We do unusual things, not the norm things, we like to have fun. “I think people should be unashamed and unafraid to explore what they want to explore.”    But Kat admitted that not everyone has been supportive of her kitten play. She said: “My family and certain people are not accepting, they donapost want to know anything about it. “Itaposs hard but Iaposm going to be who I am no matterpeople are going to be accepting of this lestyle or not. “Iaposm just going to be who I am.” Kat, who loves wearing furry ears and an articial tail, said that for her pet play is not only sexual, but it’s also her lestyle. She explaiend: “When I first got into pet play, I just felt a sense of home. Iaposve always felt like I was a cat.

They do screenings to find the weakest, most easily manipulated people to do the aposhaunt.apos Itaposs literally just a kidnapping and torture house. Some people have had to seek professional psychiatric help and medical care for extensive injuries. It is seriously just torture porn. He is also claimed participants were waterboarded and forced to eat things.  The petition has attracted more than , signatures with some people explaining on the page why they back Frankie. Sandra Seymour said: This aposattractionapos targets susceptible and vulnerable people with the promise of a large sum of money in order to torture them. Yvone Christy said: I am signing this because I watched a youtube video on this and it is definitely not a haunt it is pure torture. Participants who pass the checks must watch a two-hour video that shows people taking part in previous experiences and failed.  Throughout the video the phrase You really donapost want to do this is repeatedly spoken. Participants donapost have to pay money but they are asked to bring food for Russapos dogs. However according to Frankie this is a loophole as it means participants are doing it for fun.Russ told WGNTV : I’m a very straight-laced conservative guy, but here I run this crazy haunted house that people think is this torture factory, fetish factory. All of these things that it’s not, but people believe that based upon the films that I have made. He claims he has been reported to the police a number of times  which is one of the reasons why he films the experiences. When you have that kind of power over people... they’ll go to the authorities, he said. I have to come back and show the footage and say, ‘it didn’t go that way at all.’ It’s saved me a thousand times.”  Russ says he spent more than million on the experience which are inspired by classic horror films including Vertigo and Psycho. A notice on its website says: Be warned, McKamey Manor is not your standardhaunted house. This is an audience participation event in which you will live your own horror movie. This is a rough, intense and truly frightening experience. You must be in great health to participate .

Rebecca Churan, , from Ontario, Canada, said her self-esteem had begun to plummet because she thought she was getting uglier by the minute. Churan, who works with children in deprived areas, says she spent her birthday celebrations in tears as she tried to explain to friends that she believed her face was changing. Rebecca saw more than  doctors to address the signs she was noticing, including weight gain, fatigue, rapid growth in her feet. Doctors misdiagnosed Rebecca with borderline diabetes, depression and polycystic oy syndrome .    Rebecca had questioned her unexplained growth for a few years, particularly after her feet grew by a size and a half to a size . She was sure her chin and nose were growing, especially after looking back at old photos of herself and seeing that her face looked smaller. By the end of March , one of the doctors she saw finally issued Rebecca with an IGF- blood test which measures the quantity of insulin-like growth factor in the body. The typical measurement of the growth hormone should be between -, depending on age, however Rebeccaaposs measurement was an astonishing . The blood test confirmed that Rebecca had a pituitary tumour which was releasing the growth hormone.     Needing to have the tumour removed through her nose was terrying for Rebecca, but less so than avoiding surgery and continually growing and becoming disfigured. The tumour was removed on April , but before going into surgery Rebecca traced the outline of her hands to seethey changed size. Since the surgery, Rebeccaaposs hands have shrunk by an inch, her feet have gone down a size and a half, she has lost st lb in weight and her nose and chin are smaller. I went out for my birthday with a group of friends but during the evening I was unable to stay awake and needed multiple naps before going out with the girls.    They all tried to cheer me up, but I was crying uncontrollably, and I knew something was wrong, said Rebecca. My best friend, Anisa, held my hand while we went from pub to pub and I remember her asking me where my confidence had gone since we met at university. Thankfully she was there for me because I would have never made it through that night without her cheering me on. The next few days were awful, I slept most of the day and still required more than ten hours of sleep at night. I went to see a doctor for an opinion in the hopes of any sort of answer. I have seen more than ten doctors over the years who would just address my symptoms. I have been misdiagnosed with borderline diabetes, generalised anxiety disorder, depression and PCOS.  I told this doctor that my face was changing, and I was getting uglier, and that I didnapost understand why I was gaining weight since I was barely eating. She issued me a blood test and then called me back in and told me I had a pituitary tumour based on the results of that test. Normal range for the growth hormone is between  and , and I was at a whopping  level - which is high even for a teenager with gigantism. There really is no information other than extreme cases online. Thereaposs barely any awareness or tools to help people recognise the signs, so many cases are diagnosed as hormonal disorders. I saw the scariest photos of Andre the giant and others who had not been treated early on during the process. I was mortied, scared, and hopeless.  The tumour caused the extreme tiredness, my anxiety, weight gain, the growth of my hands, feet, nose and chin. I had this tumour for over  years based on the photos Iaposve looked back over, but I just thought it was the way I was ageing at the time. I questioned my growth a few years ago when my feet shot up half a size, but I had gained weight too and I thought it must have been caused by water retention or my borderline diabetes diagnosis. I went to Alberta and an endocrinologist, Doctor Nisha Haroon, got me in a for a CT scan that same day and that was when we saw my tumour. I was petried because I had a tumour in my brain which they needed to remove, butI didnapost have surgery then I would continue to become disfigured! Surgery was April  by Doctor Cusimano and the tumour was taken out through my nasal cavity.

success at Somerset Park came on the back of a devastating late collapse at home to bottom side Partick the week previously.And Kerr says the belief that victory over the Championship’s second-placed team has given Dundee is bigger than just three points.He told the Tele: “It was important to get past the Partick game straight away.“There was pressure on Friday night with where Ayr are in the league.“When you go to places like Ayr, with the conditions there and it being such an important game, to come away with a result is big.“It wasn’t the best of games and a good battle but to come away with three points and a good resilient performance is massive for us.”The Wasps may be at the wrong end of the table but have already shown they are a match for anybody in the ision, including a - win over leaders Dundee United just three weeks ago.They also ran Dundee close at Dens Park, missing a penalty to allow the Dark Blues to run out - victors.“Alloa showed they can play when they were up here and I saw the Friday night game against Dundee United and they played really well that night,” Kerr added.“I don’t knowUnited were off-colour that night but Alloa certainly played well.“Against us they missed a penalty and had chances so we have to be on our game.“We’re under no illusions how tough it is going to be but we need to show the same application we have shown recently, apart from the latter stages of the Partick game.“We need to show resilience, calmness on the ball and patience.“I think we are getting to that.“Being a team coming together at the start of the season we knew it would take a bit of time.“There is still a long way to go to where we want to be but we are taking strides towards that.”A part of that was winning their first three points on the road.Before the trip to Somerset Park, Dundee had just two points to show from their first four away trips.They’ve put that to bed – now they want their first back-to-back victories of the Championship season, according to Kerr.He added: “Getting our first away win in the league is a good wee hurdle to get over.“The longer those things go, the more its talked about which can be a distraction from what is actually important which is going on the park and performing.“Getting two in a row now is the aim.“Whether it’s a home game where everyone expects a win or an away game where you are going to have to dig deep, we go into it with only one thought and that is to come away with the three points. We have to have that mentality.“It’s also good to have a run of games close to one anotherthings are going well, especially after a win it’s good to bounce back with another game.”Set-pieces have been a problem area for the Dark Blues this season. Ayr’s goal from Luke McCowan came after Kerr was beaten in the air from a free-kick.The full-back, though, is honest enough to hold his hands up and says he’s doing all he can to improve that part of his game.“That’s something I need to get better at. I always look at myself and what I can improve on and that’s something I need to look at personally.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/40ee610e-f8f9-4449-87d2-2bd8dde58e5e-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/40ee610e-f8f9-4449-87d2-2bd8dde58e5e-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/40ee610e-f8f9-4449-87d2-2bd8dde58e5e-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/40ee610e-f8f9-4449-87d2-2bd8dde58e5e-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"dca to host christmas craft and design market","story":"DCA will host a special Christmas craft and design market at the end of next month.Crafted will feature work from  independent designers and makers from across Scotland.Among the items that visitors can buy will be jewellery, textiles, illustration, print and homeware.There will be opportunities to the find a gt for family and friends in the lead up to Christmas.The market will be held on Saturday November  and will run from .am to .pm.It will be held on the ground and first floor of the contemporary arts centre.The event is free to attend and no booking is required.More information about the exhibitors who will be participating in the event will be made available in the run up to the market day.For more information, visit the DCA’s social media."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/10/5db2ad05abd6b8.82495880.jpg ","title":"downfield golf course submit plans for driving range","story":"Management at a city golf course have remained tight-lipped over claims of illegal tree-felling even after submitting plans for a new driving range nearby.Officers at Scottish Forestry are continuing to probe activity at Downfield Golf Course after trees were cut down on land earmarked for a new housing development.Earlier this year the club submitted a planning application in partnership with developer Kirkwood Homes to build  homes on the land beside Dalmahoy Drive.It has been suggested by both the club and the housebuilder that the project is essential to guarantee the long-term future of the course.However, the trees have been felled before planning permission was even approved – leading to local residents accusing developers of a “done deal”.Scottish legislation requires that anyone looking to cut down trees needs to get a felling permission from the government, eventhe plants are not protected.A felling permission for the golf club was granted in  but has since expired.In addition, the land on which the trees have been cut down is designated as a “locally important nature conservation site” by the council.Despite this, the local authority has insisted that the land is not bound by any protective measures.Both Dundee City Council and Kirkwood have denied being behind the tree-felling.And despite repeated requests for comment the club is yet to respond.The Tele visited the club’s offices last week and were told the course manager, John Watson, was on holiday until this week.And despite the club’s ongoing silence, a new planning application has been submitted to city planners proposing a new driving range.Designs for the new driving range have been drawn up with the proposed housing in mind.A .m-high embankment is proposed for the furthest end of the field to protect the most vulnerable homes from wayward golf balls."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/40ee610e-f8f9-4449-87d2-2bd8dde58e5e-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/40ee610e-f8f9-4449-87d2-2bd8dde58e5e-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/40ee610e-f8f9-4449-87d2-2bd8dde58e5e-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/40ee610e-f8f9-4449-87d2-2bd8dde58e5e-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"dundee united boss pleased with teams response to recent defeats with 2 0 win over dunfermline","story":"Dundee United manager Robbie Neilson says he is pleased with the way his team responded to recent defeats in their -

That’s what we looked to do on Saturday because we knew we had a tough week ahead. It was good to go and get the victory to start the week positively.“It’ll definitely be a tough test. Thistle were always a well-drilled side, even before McCall went there, and they’ll be the same again.“They might even be better but it’s a tough fixture because they’re a good side with good players.“It’s another test like Saturday was which we need to take in our stride and, hopefully, go and get a good result. Obviously the home form is a positive because you need to win as many home games as you can but we’re not going to get carried away and feel like we need to beat everybody.“We just need to turn up and do our jobs week-in, week-out and make sure that we’re performing at our best when we’re at home. vw, px\"  “If we do that, we’ll get results.“We had two disappointing results in the last two games away from home and it’s something that happens in this league.“You see teams dropping points all over the place so it is like that.“If we keep our home form good, though, and win most of our games then we can maybe afford to drop a couple away.“Obviously, we’ll look to go up to Inverness on a real grass pitch as well, which helps, and put on a performance there. But we have a big test tonight first.”Nicky Clark got the second goal against Dunfermline on Saturday after teeing up Shankland, leading the hitman to praise his colleague.“It was good to get back on the scoresheet with a tap in and I was delighted to see Clarky get his first goal and get off the mark as well.“Earlier in the season we had glimpses of playing with each other but he got injured.

So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

Two men were paid to accompany Patrick the Fool on his journey from England to provide entertainment for the King and his guests while residing at Tarbert.Also recorded is a figure for #making a suit for the King at Tarbert#.  Bruce visited Tarbert on many occasions. His final visit was in the year of his death.Tarbert is believed to have been one of the earliest Royal Burghs in Argyll. An early reference as such was made in . It is also said to have had one of the earliest paved streets in Scotland.King James IV also had a close connection with Tarbert. The addition of the #keep# to the castle, part of which still stands today, was constructed at his direction. Whilst this work was underway, James summoned parliament to meet him here to discuss matters local to the area. This meeting took place on July  .Over the years, many travellers of note have passed this way and commented on Tarbert and its scenic surroundings.In  Thomas Pennant arrived by sea at East Loch Tarbert and described the scenery as #picturesque#.CGS Teighnmouthpassed through the Kyles of Bute in  and commented that #it offers no scenery worthy of notice#. He continued to note that #the romantic little harbour of East Loch Tarbert – with the overhanging keep of its ruined castle # form a scene singularly picturesque#. He became a frequent visitor to Tarbert.In  Lord Cockburndescribed the Kyles as #rugged and picturesque# but, arriving at his destination, exclaimed: #But Tarbert! East Tarbert!

Argyll and Bute Council imposes restrictions on works likely to have a visual impact on its appearance.But the council has apparently raised no objection to this visually damaging proposal. Similarly, Visit Scotland is reported as having raised no objection as well as closing all its tourist offices in Cowal, Mid Argyll and Kintyre in the past year.With the recent decline in the Loch Fyne fishing industry, Tarbert is increasingly dependent on tourism to provide employment.Other issues include the sterilisation of ground under the proposed line of overhead wiring. Opportunities to extend social housing will be restricted under the present plan.OFGEM administers a £ million fund set up to mitigate the impact of electricity infrastructure on national parks and #scenic areas#.Tarbert, along with its harbour and the isthmus linking it with West Loch Tarbert, without doubt, constitutes a #scenic area#.Reconsideration of this proposal is essential."},{"url":null,"title":"accordion and fiddle club back in tune","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe new season of Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club gets underway on Wednesday October .Guest artistes for the opening night are accordion maestro Gordon Pattullo from Coupar Angus, with Malcolm Ross on drums making a welcometo the club.Margaret Mather encouraged supporting players to join for a tune: #Without you there would be no club, so why not look out your accordion or fiddle and head for the Inveraray Inn.#This season, the club has opted for a new starting time of .pm for each session."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 4 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsTo an observer, it seems that Argyll and Bute Council is, at best, confused over its approach to autism.The people who know this best are those affected by the condition and their families and their view of senior council officials was made crystal clear when Autism Argyll gave up banging its head against a brick wall a year ago.Little seems to have changed since then.A council Autism Strategy Group is apparently being bypassed in the formulation of a strategy, yet the councillor in charge of health and social care says the strategy is the responsibility of the HSCP.Yet again, it is people affected by autism who are losing out.

Her partner Rebecca Taylor read music as an organ scholar at Lincoln College, Oxford before attending the Royal Academy of Music where she was a Junior Fellow and completed the MA in Piano Accompaniment.The audience were introduced to the pair with an intense piece by Mozart about burning letters and it certainly woke us up. We moved onto Schubert’s #Du Bist Die Ruh# which was beautully controlled by both singer and pianist.This was contrasted with Shubert’s angsty #Gretchen am Spinnrade# and I commend Rebecca Taylor for playing the right hand part with ease. The journey then moved through Schumann and into Brahms where the audience murmured in agreement at the rollercoaster of emotions before us.As we reached Wolf the themes took a darker turn in a short but intense piece about crying tears of blood. Swtly moving onto Strauss and Mahler the audience were given songs of simple love, a sing off between a cuckoo and a nightingale and a man in great pain which reigned the audience in with a spiritual lull.The second half opened with a stunning rendition of Faure’s #Apres Un Reve#. Through Debussy’s impressionist piece, Rinaldo Hahn’s Operatic journey and into Du Parc comforting his love with a dream like harp created by the piano.The duo then gave us a contemporary piece by Joseph Horowitz which comprised of snippets from the monologues of Shakespeare’s Lady Macbeth and the music tracks her descent into madness. It was aAs a light and fun ending we were given #I can be a sexy lady#, a piece about poor mezzos and how they always play boys and not much  in operas.

John Kennedy played the ball between the penalty spot and the D where Allan MacDonald let the ball run across his body before turning and blasting home, giving Cameron Sutherland no chance in the Oban goal.There were harsh words in the Oban Camanachd dressing room at half-time and revamp saw Keith MacMillan replace Gary McKerracher whilst the forward line switched to a three-one formation with Andrew MacCuish on the D.The switches paid idends when the home side drew level just four minutes into the second half when Daniel MacCuish ran forward and Daniel MacVicar volleyed the ball into the net to make it -.Oban Camanachd took the lead on  minutes when Andrew MacCuish’s turn and shot flew past the keeper.Just a couple of minutes later, Andrew MacCuish turned provider as he found Scott MacMillan who finished with a low drive from the left although his effort may have taken a slight deflection.Two of the game’s best young goalkeepers were on show, and Inveraray’s Scott MacLachlan saved his side from a bigger defeat though Oban Camanachd did have to rely on Cameron Sutherland who made good saves near the end from Garry MacPherson and Allan MacDonald.The win for Oban Camanachd means that they and Kyles are the only sides, other than championship favourites Kingussie, in the title race as the season moves into the closing stages."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column october 11 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowACHA tenantIt has been a while since we carried a story where a tenant has a complaint about a housing association property.

With Mondays five matches delivering only one win it was a rather downbeat team who gathered for the team meeting that night.Stuart #The Forest# Johnston couldn#t see the wood for the trees, The Sneddon couldn#t see the goal for the hanky protecting his head from the sun, Iain #Caravan# MacDonald was thinking too much about camper vans, whilst Tom #The Gin# Kilcolm didn#t live up to his name and went nearly tea total.Captain Anderson though delivered when it mattered. With Colin #The Cat# in goal, Sneddon was deployed at the back alongside. MacDonald, Johnston and Kilcolm were pushed further forward with the captain and #The Scribe# Litster in midfield. As Dinah Washington once sang, what a dference a day makes.In their first game on Tuesday the Jerry Hatricks won -. Goals from Johnston, Anderson and Litster gave a renewed sense of hope.The second match v Algarve Tavira though was all about the captain. A fabulous five goal haul and a carpet burn saw them run out - winners.Match three versus Browns from Vilamoura was always going to be a tough test and thanks to a fantastic rearguard action from Sneddon and MacDonald, allied to goals from Litster and Johnston, Jerry Hatricks came out - victors.Knowing that victory in the penultimate match against the Lagos Tigers would all but see them through it was left to Kilcolm to make his mark. A fantastic solo effort in a - win capped a great team performance. Tom would have run around with the customary shirt over the head celebration, however he found the snug fit just too much to pull over his head.By the time the final game took place the team had both done enough and run out of steam.

further improvements are required across much of the local authorityambitious savings plans and satisfaction ratings are to be met.Audit Scotland carried out a major review into Scottish Borders Council between January and May.As well as interviewing councillors and senior officers, auditors sat in on meetings, reviewed documents and files, and held meetings with trade union representatives.While the resulting -page report card highlights an improving picture since the previous audit in , bosses have been told to communicate better and form better relationships with partners, such as NHS Borders.The report also highlights required improvements in some departments and the need for elected councillors to be better equipped for the tough decisions they face.Graham Sharp, chair of the Accounts Commission, told us: ldquoThe continued progress Scottish Borders Council has made to transform services is encouraging.\"Now it must focus on several critical areas including tackling underperforming services, ensuring councillors have the right training to enable them to fulfil their responsibilities and getting to grips with both staff and community engagement.Across the  performance indicators used in the Best Value Assurance Report, Scottish Borders Council was found to be below average in more than half.While education and social work are doing well, other aspects of the local authority arent quite making the grade.A lack of investment in creating employment and boosting tourism was criticised, as was the low amount of contracts awarded to local companies and the fall in the number of bills settled within  days.The deteriorating condition of local authority buildings was also highlighted.Problems since the outsourcing of IT services to multinational firm CGI - a -year contract worth pound million - were also raised by auditors.While the report identies the delays and issues which plagued customer access of the councils online services, auditors said it was too soon to gauge the impact of iPads taking over more traditional teaching methods in Borders schools from this year.And the methodology of farming out senior staff, such as the Executive Director for Commercial Activity spending four days of his week as managing director of the failed SB Cares, and the Executive Director for Strategic Partnerships seconded to the South of Scotland Enterprise Agency three days each week, was also questioned.The report stated: \"While this is a positive and innovative approach aimed at realising the councils wider ambitions, it must continue to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to deliver local services.\"But, perhaps, coming in for the most criticism was the current culture of secrecy and the need for better communication and engagement with staff, councillors and the public.The report stated: \"The council should be more effective in evaluating, managing and reporting its performance, bringing greater clarity on where and how its services need to improve.\"It also needs to get better at the reporting of performance - both in terms of information considered by members and in reporting to the public.\"Budgeting at the local authority, though, was applauded by auditors.And, during extremely dficult economic times, the managing to maintain its usable reserves in case of emergencies was also identied.Although Audit Scotland identied further development was needed for the ambitious Fit for  mid-term savings plan, which aims to trim pound. million from budgets by , the report is complimentary of cost cutting to date.The report stated: \"The council has a good record of achieving savings and has reflected the impact of demographic change on demands for services and pay increases for staff, in its financial plans.\"However, in common with all other councils, the financial outlook remains a signicant challenge.\"Council chief executive Tracey Logan welcomed the detailed analysis of her local authority.And she admitted many of the problems in the Audit Scotland report are already being tackled.She told us: \"We will take on board Audit Scotlandrsquos feedback and recommendations, many of which we had already identied ourselves and are taking action on, and continue to drive forward transformational change across all our services through our Fit for

Council will be asked rethink its controversial playparks proposals, following two petitions that were signed by over a thousand concerned residents.In May , the council agreed plans to consult on the possible closure of  small playparks it says are underused and falling into disrepair.Instead, the council plans to spend poundm over the next decade on six large playparks, three skateparks and four fitness shelters.However, following a backlash from residents in Hawick and Kelso, two petitions have been handed into the local authority objecting to the plans.Nine Kelso playparks are at risk of closure: High Croft Meadow Court Orchard Park Rosewood Gardens Springwood Rise Spylaw Park Sydenham Court Woodside Gardens and the Kelso petition has attracted  signatures.Ten playparks are at risk in Hawick: Bowden Road Burnfoot School Hawick Green Hislop Gardens Leaburn Drive Mayfield Millers Knowe Waverley Walk Wellington Court and Wilson Drive and the Hawick petition has attracted  signatures.Those petitions were presented to the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee today, October , so it could hear from the lead petitioners and decide how to respond.Appearing before the committee, Kirsty Wichary, lead petitioner for Kelso, told councillors: ldquoWhat do we want our towns to look like in the future  Financial constraints aside, do we not look to have a beautul Borders, with outdoor spaces for all to enjoy ldquoHow did we get to this point, where there is no money for these parks  Investing in new technology for education is to be applauded, butparents had a choice, which would they choose ldquoTechnology isnrsquot helping our children to lead healthy, well-rounded lives. The stress of being a youngster in the st century is enormous.ldquoWe should be investing in more play areas and green spaces instead of taking them away.ldquoThe thought of removing these playparks seems a very backwards step, a step towards a cultural desert and a future for our youngsters with more weight problems, more mental health issues and future generations unable to communicate effectively, even within their own peer groups.ldquoDo you really want to be remembered as the council who handed out iPads but took away the parks Hawickrsquos lead petitioner, Greg Dalgliesh, owner of the townrsquos Think Fitness  Less gym in Hawick, was unable to attend the meeting due to a family bereavement, soHawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer presented his petition on his behalf.He told the committee: ldquo mainly local residents, parents and family members in Hawick have chosen to exercise their right to object to a proposal that would see  playparks across the Scottish Borders, including  in Hawick, the largest town in the Borders, effectively close as a result of a disinvestment of financial support from this council.ldquoThe vast majority of these people and the many who support this action through other means are stakeholders in Scottish Borders Council. They live here, they are required to pay their council tax and, consequently, they have a right to determine how that money should be spent.ldquoI quote from the petition: lsquowe believe in this instance lsquobigger and better facilitiesrsquo should not be justication to remove the smaller playparks that are situated in the ious housing estates in Hawick and the Borders.ldquolsquoIt is very clear from the comments associated with this petition and via social media these smaller parks are still well used and have been described as a safe place to play and exercise on the doorstep of many homes.ldquo lsquoNot everyone can access the likes of Wilton Lodge Park on a regular basis, and children with additional needs also find these areas too busy and noisyrsquo.Councillors discussed a number of possible actions including sending the playpark proposals back out to the public for further consultation and gauging the opinion of community councils in affected areas.In the end, councillors voted to support sending a motion to the next full council meeting, scheduled for Thursdayasking it to reconsider giving authority to officers to determine which playparks can be closed.That motion was proposed by Tweeddale East councillor Heather Anderson and seconded by Selkirkshire councillor Elaine Thornton-Nicol.A counter motion, proposed by East Berwickshire councillor Jim Fullarton and seconded by Jedburghrsquos Scott Hamilton, was also put forward, but it lost out to Ms Anderson and Ms Thornton-Nicolrsquos suggestionby five votes to three.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Wichary said: ldquoIrsquom very happy that itrsquos going to have to go back to the council to be reconsidered.ldquoIrsquom assuming, hopefully, that our petitions in both Kelso and Hawick have given them a lot of food for thought and that we wonrsquot see the closure of all the parks that were mentioned.ldquoItrsquos very clear that there are cost implications, but Irsquom quite confident that there will be some sort of compromise made.Mr McAteer added: ldquoI am delighted that the majority of the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee have supported the Hawick petition designed to stop the council closing a number of our playparks.ldquoTheir decision will now resulted in this matter being referred to a full meeting of Scottish Borders council where elected members

And a reminder that Im not getting any younger as I try to grow old gracefully.JCCs, now a septuagenarian, style has remained a constant.His image of the suit, shagpile black hair and sunglasses remain intact. His social realism poetic constructs seem relevant today as they did during his inception, extrapolated initially from the often nihilism and tales of social decay that earmarked punk mark one.Poetry is often a barometer of an epoch or epochs. Combining observation and the written word. JCC has become a master of mind imagery, social commentary, surrealism, and semantics and above all story telling. We get it because it resonates with us.It is us or we know someone who it references. Sometimes dystopian, often hilarious and never dull. Add the heavy Salfordian brogue the chemistry set is complete.The performance was slightly peculiar to what I was expecting.Maybe my expectations were misguided or unrealistic. There were some long periods of stand-up comedy that laboured at times.It was only when \"Johnny\" ed to his natural home of poetry recital that he got back on track. Though his joke about Billy Bragg being in crisis because he hadnt released an album in two weeks, I found amusing.But when he got back to the poetry it was a reminder why most people were here.Most poems were from the back catalogue and instantly recognisable. A greatest hit set list.JCC proceeded with Hire Car and the sharply expletive named Get Back on Drugs You Fat F***.Well it was an adult show after all.Common language for common poetry. And it never did Billy Connelly any harm. The poem insinuating it was easier to lose weight being on drugs.Beasley Street, arguably his most well-known poem received one of the best reactions of the night. Imbued with the description of a rock bottom street, a dreg of society and where everything that could go wrong did in this street. A caricature of a threadbare existentialism. Mainly bought on by social and economic deprivation.And then a natural supersession in the form of an epilogue Beasley Street Bouled recital, as the street had now changed into middle class suburbia.Next up Ive Fallen in Love with My We. A reference to marriage, the vows and marital bliss. Tongue in cheek of course.The \"bloody song\" Evidently Chickentown, was greeted with widespread applause. More nihilistic scorn and deprecation of a town, that is in a state of dys.Funny how we tend to laugh at the misfortune of others. But we do.Twat was another poem that represented consistency in tonights performance. A crowd pleaser for all times. Twat being the ultimate character assassination and castout. Bringing sporadic fits of laughter within the audience.The closing recital I Wanna Be Yours, famously adopted by The Arctic Monkeys for one of their songs, represented a slight U-turn in the writing of JCC. More linked to a character who wishes to show an undying love for someone . The positives of the human condition. Did I detect some optimism!The MacArts performance had poetry that mixes modernity with the historical. Comedic in value.When we laugh, we are laughing at ourselves. With him, not at him.

It reads: ldquoAlcohol bylaws are used within the three other local council areas within Lothian and Borders, namely East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian.ldquoBy having such bylaws in force it assists Police Scotland in reducing anti-social behaviour and violence both of which are known to have an association with drinking in public.ldquoCurrently the Scottish Borders area is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.NHS Borders, Borders Alcohol and Drug Partnership and Scottish Borders Children and Young Peoplersquos Leadership Group provided a joint response, which reads: ldquoAlcohol consumption can take place in our communitiesrsquo private space as well as within licensed premises.ldquoNot allowing people to drink in a public place will help to reduce the normalisation of alcohol being an ordinary commodity and builds communities and environments that supports a culture change and reduces exposure for our children and young people.ldquoPublic drinking can adversely affect the quality of le for residents and our communities.ldquoAlcohol Focus Scotland report that one in two Scots experience harm from anotherrsquos drinking and often this harm is experienced in public spaces .ldquoIn this study % had experienced harm to others in public places and this was mostlyexperienced by the younger age group .ldquoAlcohol bylaws can be used as an additional tool to reduce the nuisance and disorder normally associated with public drinking.ldquoLicensed premises are well regulated within the Scottish Borders and provide the opportunity to consume alcohol in a safe environment.ldquoThe Scottish Borders is the only local authority area in Scotland that does not have bylaws restricting the consumption of alcohol in public places.Councillors will now be asked whether to conduct further consultation on two options: a blanket ban on public drinking to cover the whole of the Borders, or the introduction of an alcohol ban in certain areas of the Borders. Police Scotland has indicated it would prefer the first option, to ease the enforcement of the ban.Furthermore, councillors are asked to consider undertaking a pilot scheme in specic towns, which could then be used to gather further feedback from the public."},{"url":null,"title":"golden-granny-hilde-aims-fashion-success","story":"AN archery gold medal winning grandmother at the British Transplant Games is setting her sights on fashion.Hilde Paxton from Clovenfords, who had a liver transplant shortly after her th birthday, struck the bulls-eye at Newport earlier this year.And the -year-old is already preparing to defend her title next year by raising vital funds for her Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team.Hilde is hosting a fashion show on Saturday, November  in Galashiels.She told us: \"Edinburgh Transplant Sports Team has around  members from all over the east of Scotland who take part in the Transplant Games.\"An important part of being a member is helping to raise the funds required for sending members to the British Transplant Games.\"The Colours Fashion Team will take to the Focus Centre boardwalk on the Saturday for an evening of glamour and casual wear.Included in the pound ticket price is a complimentary glass of Prosecco on arrival.As well as the fashion show, there will also be a grand raffle and a licensed bar.Tickets for Hildes fashion show, which starts at .pm for pm, are available from the Salmon Inn and Focus Centre, Galashiels, the Bridge Inn and The Gt Shop, Peebles, or The Hub in Innerleithen."},{"url":null,"title":"top-up-tap-plans-galashiels","story":"GALASHIELS is set to become the first town in the Borders to receive an official top-up tap.Scottish Water has already installed the water stations in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Dumfries, Dunfermline, Ayr, Oban and Fort William as part of its Your Water, Your Le initiative.As well as providing healthy drinking water, the refill taps will also reduce the number of plastic bottles which are currently in circulation.Scottish Water now want to install the top-up tap in Market Place -

That race took place over the course of last weekend.The series featured five rounds at dferent venues, and each race was set up like a car rally, with untimed uphill transition stages leading to ious timed downhill sections, the results of which were amalgamated into an overall race time. The stages ied massively in , from as little as  seconds to an absolute behemoth we endured at Laggan in April which took us  minutes to ride! The topography and trail surface dfered wildly from venue to venue but also from stage to stage, and the taped trails we raced down last weekend at Fort William epitomised this eclectic set-up.Stage  was the easiest and least technical track we have raced on all year, an entirely man-made sprint through flowing banked corners coated in compacted quarry dust. Of course you had to be careful you didn`t push too hard, it is all too easy to wreck a race run by hitting the deck on an easy stage. We assumed that the organisers were trying to lull us into a  sense of security with stage #and we were so right!Stage  started halfway down the legendary World Cup track , channelling riders through some savage rock gardens before cutting off to the right along a lung-busting fireroad before descending into another sculpted hardpack track which then erted down a horrendously muddy, freshly cut chute that was littered with roots big enough to swallow a bike wheel whole. Even walking down it was impossible.A big transition ride towards Torlundy took us to the top of stage , which was the famous Blue Crane trail running into Ridgeline. Both of these tracks are black-graded on a good day, but there is a huge dference between trying to ride these ‘for fun’ and then trying to race on them once  people have spent a whole Saturday skidding them to bits in the tipping rain! A lot of people fell foul of this stage, but we survived and we absolutely loved it.Stage  was a dferent animal altogether. We had tackled it fairly early on practice day and hadn`t had any issues with it, but the swarm of maniacs who had ridden it in the rain since our earlier visit had turned it into an absolute swamp and the ruts were so deep that I found it almost impossible to negotiate with my limited skills. Dave telling me afterwards that he had romped it didn`t help my mood one bit!The last  stages were so high up the mountain that we needed a trip on the gondola to get to them. The black graded Top Chief track is a fearsome animal that follows the best twisty bedrock line around the hill before plummeting several hundred feet straight down off it into the tree line below, where it once again becomes sanitised into a flowing, twisty and utterly hilarious serpent of a trail that had riders drting and whooping all the way to the carpark. The organisers had cleverly split the Top Chief track into two stages, as there is a long section of perched wooden boardwalk high up on the mountain that is great fun to ride but would be far too dangerous to race on. Stage  was therefore very short -taking most riders about  seconds to ride- while stage  was a  minute monster. What a way to finish a season!So how did we do David was fastest of the three of us, as he has been all season. He finished in a time of  minutes,  seconds. He races in the Senior category , so it is a tough school littered with sponsored riders and crazy kids. He finished th in seniors on the day, and th overall out of an entry of  riders. Having failed to finish the race at Laggan earlier in the year due to a mechanical breakdown, David has been constantly playing catch-up but he still managed to finish in a brilliant nd place overall in the seniors category for the season.Alex has ridden consistently all year and has managed to tread the fine line between wrecking and ruling perfectly at every round. He had one of his very few crashes on the last stage at Fort William which cost him a few seconds, but he still ed a very respectable time of : to finish nd in the Masters category. The Masters section almost always attracts the largest entry and it is full of well-heeled chargers on very expensive steeds, so for Alex to finish in th place in that championshipin his first full season is a highly respectable result.I have continually been either on par or just slower than Alex on nearly every stage of the year, and nothing changed here. I knowI`ve kept within a few seconds of him I have done just fine, and I managed my ride to achieve this perfectly right up until the last stage where a cruel puncture right on top of the hill put paid to any chances of a good result to finish the year. With  top s already in the bag for the season though , I managed to hold onto th place in the Grand Veteran`s championship which was some consolation for a day that finished with me feeling, well, a bit deflated.Competing in this series has been a brilliant experience for us. We have had some hilarious times racing our bikes through some of Scotland`s very best scenery, and we have loved camping out of the back of vans. The organisers at No Fuss Events have done an outstanding job of setting up a professionally run race series in some dficult locations and have always managed to tread the right side of a precarious line, providing us with stages that have been just barely on the rideable side of ridiculous!David Muirhead leads Alex Dickson down the rocky Top Chief track during Saturday#s practice.

A high-energy showing in Paisley saw the McFadyens-sponsored side run out convincing winners.With the match going ahead at the Kibble’s grass park despite the heavy rain overnight and during the week leading up to the game, the surface was in surprisingly good condition, allowing the Pupils to get into their attacking flow early on.Up against a home side not lacking in height and physical stature, the Pupils had to be ready to contend with some lofted early balls from back to front by the hosts, whose game plan seemed to be to get the ball to their forwards as quickly as possible, but the Pupils# defence of Fraser Wylie, Ross Souden, Ryan McConnachie and Stuart Crossan, stood up to the task well.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils quick passing and inidual pace and skill in the final third caused the hosts problems early on, and Ryan Gilchrist and Gregor McFadyen, and both had almost identical attempts to score, but snatched at their shots at the vital moment.However, the Kintyre Park side would not be denied for long, and scored after  minutes through a sharp passing move that released Gregor McFayden, who buried an arrowed shot from the edge of the box to continue his excellent goalscoring form.Then, the visitors made it - after  minutes, when an enterprising move out of defence found right-back Crossan, whose ball through to Johnny McCormick allowed the right winger to cut inside onto his left foot and release a thunderous first-time drive into roof of the net for a great goal, his second of the season.After seeing their deficit doubled, Carlton for their part put their Kintyre visitors under a bit of pressure from several corners and free kicks, but the Pupils’ defensive discipline continued to win over.Into the second half, the Pupils made it - when Donald McCallum scored another great goal, in a move started by Liam Renton, whose in-swinging corner was cleared to the edge of the penalty box where the ex-Dumbarton man McCallum made space to drive a deflected shot into the top corner of the net.At this point in the match, all three subs were used, with Ellis Robertson and Michael McKinlay replacing the excellent deep-lying midfield pairing of Ryan Gilchrist and Liam Renton, and Ross Brown entering in the fray in a direct swap with winger McCormick.The youngster Brown quickly got involved to create the Pupils# fourth goal, outpacing the Carlton full-back to draw out the last defender and square the ball across for Scott Souden to cheekily chip the ball over the home keeper into the net.The rampant Pupils completed the scoring in the th minute after hesitation between a Carlton defender and his keeper allowed McFadyen to nip in, touch the ball round the keeper to score a simple but well-earned second goal, for his brace on the day, and his fourth of the season.At the other end, the Pupils were determined to get their second consecutive clean sheet in league action, and while young keeper Alistair Ferguson spilled a deflected free kick in the latter stages, he bravely ed at the feet of the striker to smother his effort. The Pupils management noted how Ferguson’s kicking and distribution was first-class throughout the match.A Pupils spokesman said: ‘It was a great team effort, with our attacking players working together to cause problems all game. At the back, we defended high balls and direct play really well.’The Pupils are in league action again tomorrowwhen they welcome Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star.

George reminisced: ‘It was announced at a Town Council meeting that the Royal couple was scheduled to visit. It was all to be top secret, but that didn’t happen. The next morning the #secret# was ulged in a queue in one of the town’s shops and the news was out.’With a smile that showed how fond these memories are to him, George continued: ‘The Royal Yacht Britannia was anchored out in the loch and a small boat brought the Queen and Prince Philip to the quay where my father was delegated to catch and secure the rope. They were then driven to the Town Hall and there was a huge crowd present.‘Campbeltown Gaelic Choir, conducted by Mr M G McCallum who was also a councillor, had a lovely surprise for the Royal visitors. Prince Charles had just been made Prince of Wales, so the choir sang ‘God Bless the Prince of Wales’. This was very well received, and the Queen said that she had not heard it before.’George and Mrs McMillan were present at a reception given by the Town Council in the Town Hall. George remembers that he shook hands with the Queen and spoke with the Duke of Edinburgh. He said: ‘Only those invited could speak to the Queen, but the Duke moved among the gathering and spoke to some of the councillors. I was a coal miner at Machrihanish at that time and he asked me and some other miners about our work.’He continued: ‘The food and drinks were served on silver trays by waiters in tails and bow-ties. Afterwards, when the couple was taken on a tour of the town, the heavens opened and oh how it rained and rained.’A town councillor from May  to its disbanding in , and then a councillor on the District Council and the Strathclyde Regional Council, George was to meet the Queen and other members of the Royal Family on other occasions.

What is it I always do riddles when I tell stories. I think of riddles and stories as close cousins which support each other.A good brain-teasing riddle is usually fun, and children in particular love the challenge of solving a riddle, as well as making their own ones up.Irsquom often greeted with pleas for ldquoTim, tell us one more riddle when I enter a school, and Irsquom often challenged to solve a riddle made up by one of the children.They are an ancient form of learning and entertainment.The first discovered written riddles are close to , years old. They were written in Cuneorm, the writing of the ancient Sumerians.A shortened and simplied version of one of these earliest riddles is: ldquoA house you enter blind, but come out with sight. What kind of house is it  The answer is a school, although some may raise an eyebrow at this answer.Perhaps the most famous riddle from antiquity is the Riddle of the Sphinx to Oedipus, recorded in ancient Greek around the fth century BC: ldquoWhat is the creature that walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening The answer is a human being. When a baby we crawl on four legs, as an adult we walk on two legs, in old age we need a third leg .With my now continuous painful knee, this riddle has particular relevance for me, although Irsquom stubbornly resisting the stick!I use riddles as ice breakers in storytelling sessions and as an engagement technique because they quickly hook an audiencersquos attention since they are, by their nature, interactive.But they are also great fun to use with the children in your family.I use them to help distract and calm my younger ones when they are fractious. I use them in the morning when the kids are getting ready for school so they concentrate on them while they are getting ready.We make the riddles about the things we can see and the things we are doing, for example: ldquoTherersquos a big one and a wee one and three in between, we are two families of five, we are all going to nursery, but we are usually not seen. Who are we  The answer, of course, is my sonrsquos toes!For younger kids, itrsquos important to repeat riddles they already know the answer to. It helps them learn the riddle and how wordplay works. It also teaches them the rhythm of how they are told.My four-year-old is getting pretty good at this, although the answers to his own made-up riddles donrsquot always make sense.That doesnrsquot matter at this stage, whatrsquos important is hersquos developing an understanding of how they work and it encourages him to look for things to make riddles about.His nearly six-year-old sister likes to challenge him too.Her riddle ldquoI am short when I sit, I am long when I jump, what am I  had me thinking for some time before I got the answer: a frog.To make a riddle, think of the answer first. Then work the riddle up to the answer. It involves thinking about all the dferent qualities, uses of and parts of the answer and how they can be twisted or described dferently.For example, a shoe has a tongue but canrsquot talk, a clock has a face and hands but no body, a river has a bed but doesnrsquot sleep.Once introduced to riddle-making, children can get really engaged with it. A group of seven-eight-year-olds in a P class challenged me last week with a riddle they had made up themselves: ldquoI have a brain full of teacherrsquos knowledge, I crash without moving, I freeze while staying warm, what am I  The answer is a computer.Some riddles rhyme and it can be an extra challenge to think of a rhyming riddle, but they donrsquot have to rhyme.It really is a fun and rewarding activity to make a regular habit in the car, dinner table, on a walk or even a bedtime riddle.To help you out, there are literally thousands of examples of riddles in books, on the internet, in history, films and ones you hear. But the best ones will be those made up yourself, and the more you do it, the better at it you will become.And the benefits of riddling regularly with your family can be signicant, especially for children.

It is felt at the moment that the draft in its entirety is not acceptable until this letter is lodged and any concerns we have are taken on board.ldquoNot everybody understood everything that was involved in the draft plan but time was needed to make sure not only all the community councillors were more familiar with the draft plan but we had heard from HBCP and Haddington residents.ldquoIt was felt in the past that at community council meetings not enough time had been dedicated to it, hence the reason why Tuesday night happened.When the controversial proposals were revealed, the local authority confirmed it was ldquoexploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.The new lsquoedge of centrersquo car park, dubbed a park and stride or a park and ride, would encourage people to walk or be bussed from Whittingehame Drive back into the town centre.No location has been confirmed for any new car park, although there have been concerns raised as to how it would impact upon community events such as Nungate Gala and the townrsquos fireworks.The long-stay car park at the townrsquos Tesco store, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could also become a short-stay car park.Joanna Gibson, HBCP chairwoman, outlined the grouprsquos feelings about the proposed scheme before non-community councillors were asked to leave the meeting ndash a decision that, according to East Lothian Council, was entirely down to the community council.A number of businesses feared they would not be able to operate through a y construction period. There were also worries that businesses would be forced to close and, with none moving in, it would result in a poorer High Street.Mrs Gibson said: ldquoWe do not think that this design has enough merit to counter the huge disruption of even phase one of the plan.ldquoThere were at least three plans at the initial consultations, why were none of the others considered  Perhaps within these plans we might have found a non-disruptive way to actually improve the town centre.ldquoThe shared space for events we believe will rarely be used as there does not seem to be any motivation or intentions, to our knowledge, to appoint someone to manage this.ldquoWe already have excellent event space outside the Corn Exchange offering indoor and outdoor event space and at Whittingehame Drive, and round the River Tyne where very successful community events are held.ldquoWe believe that parking is an important factor in retaining businesswe are to compete with the [proposed] new retail park [at Gateside] and survive and prosper.ldquoThis has also been the conclusion of many high street and town centre survival papers and studies worldwide.A council spokesman said: ldquoWe are continuing to develop proposals to improve the attractiveness, ality and accessibility of the town in support of the community and local businesses. This includes improved pedestrian and cycle access, as well as exploring additional options for sustainable travel improvements in and around Haddington town centre.ldquoOur priorities are to protect and enhance the local environment while supporting the local economy.

Nothing remarkable about that.After all, hasnt Jacob Rees-Mogg survived the scandal of a scornful slouch on the green benches in the House of Commons  The Right Honourable Member took up three seats with his horizontal pose, giving the appearance of waiting for Nanny to come and tuck him in.Anna Turley, the Labour MP, called Rees-Moggrsquos lounging the ldquophysical embodiment of arrogance, entitlement, disrespect and contempt for our parliament.To be fair, the Leader of the House had had a long day, having to wait out a Brexit debate, only one of the most consequential in parliamentary history.And there was Sir Desmond Swayne last year having  winks during a speech by colleague Ken Clarke in the House of Commons. Or, a wee  seconds, as Sir Desmond later claimed. \"It happened,\" he said, expressing annoyance at himself after being pictured with his head lolling on his shoulder, \"And it wont happen again.\"His excuse, he said, was a \"very long day\". It was an interesting excuse, given that one was expecting a detailed summary of how he had been up early dealing with parliamentary business. In fact, hed been up at .am for a dip in the Serpentine before work. I cant say thats much of an excuse but Im ill equipped to judge, given Ill happily nap on the floor of a public toiletthe mood takes me.Speaking after his colleague had been caught asleep on the job, fellow Tory MP Bernard Jenkins said back in the bad old days, before Commons proceedings were first televised in , MPs used to use the Chamber for a nap.\"Its only the advent of television,\" Mr Jenkins said, \"That means you cant go in to the House of Commons and have a snooze.\"Its only the advent of smartphones turning everyone and their granny into a paparazzo that allowed Corbyn to be caught using his commute to catch up on a bit of REM.What an invasion of privacy to be photographed asleep. A mid-market newspaper published the picture with apparent disgust at Mr Corbyn snoozling away as England played the All Blacks.Despite being out for the count, a Labour spokesman said \"Jeremy followed the game and is delighted England won.\"The leader of the opposition also tweeted that the game had been \"an incredible team performance and hard-fought victory\". What a let down. Honestly being the best policy here, the politician should have tweeted his congratulations and fronted up: \"Missed the game, was having a well-earned nap.\"Cant do that, though, as its more socially acceptable to be caught fibbing than to be caught napping. The clues in the phrase: \"caught\". And why Corbyn wasnt working, he was travelling. Thats what train journeys are for, a little siesta. And bus journeys. People are less relaxed about napping while driving but folk can be funny about these things.Youre \"caught\" napping because of the negative stereotypes attached to daytime sleeping, that naps are signs of weakness and sloth. Yet who do we have in the opposite corner Maggie Thatcher advertised how little sleep she needed. Donald Trump boasts of only four hours a night. Hand me my bedsocks.In Japan Jeremy Corbyn would be praised for his diligence in working himself to the point of exhaustion. Sleeping in public is a practice known as inemuri and is more acceptable than cancelling an engagement due to fatigue.You can nap anywhere - shopping mall, cafe, public transport - as long as you arent sprawled unsociably, violating more space than you need to. Take note, Rees-Mogg.Inemuri, despite being an ancient practice, is a neat melding of the modern trend of praising the desire to be constantly, performatively busy, with holding naps as king.Its been firmly established that naps are a positive step for good physical and emotional health. In the US employers such as Nike and Google have recognised the benefit of a well rested workforce for increased production. One has nap pods in its headquarters, the other has space for sleep or meditation.Its a sensible way forward. Down with the shame of snoozing. Up with refreshing rests.If we go for a December election, Labour should run on a promise of protected nap times for workers. A sleep pod in every workplace. It would be a dream ticket."},{"url":null,"title":"uk-governments-top-scots-law-officer-misconduct-tribunal","story":"Lord Richard Keen QC, the Advocate General for Scotland, faces allegations of behaving in a way that was ldquolikely to diminish the trust and confidence which the public places in a barrister or in the profession.The professional charge follows his pound, fine in  after pleading guilty to failing to secure a shotgun for which he held a valid licence.The offence came to light after police checked his home in Edinburgh after reports of a suspected burglary while Lord Keen and his we were on holiday and found an unsecured -gauge in a bag in a cupboard in the basement.Appearing at a Bar Tribunals and Adjudication Servicehearing on Tuesday, Lord Keen denied professional misconduct.Tom Forster QC, representing the Bar Standards Board, said Lord Keen had failed in a core duty of being a barrister by being convicted of the criminal offence which carries a maximum jail sentence of six months.He said: ldquoI submit, and it brings me no great pleasure to do so, that Lord Keen did breach the core duty.ldquoFirst, it is plain that breach of a condition of a shotgun certicate is not a minor criminal offence.ldquoIt may not be a serious criminal conviction but that is not to say it is a minor criminal offence.Mr Forster said the allegation was not about Lord Keenrsquos integrity or honesty but his ldquocarelessness with the shotgun which put the public at risk.ldquoThe gun was being kept in a residential property in an urban area therefore there was a heightened obligation to Lord Keen to ensure it was kept securely, he said.The tribunal heard Lord Keen had used the shotgun on  December , then forgot toit to a locked safe before going on holiday.Lord Keen was accused of having a ldquolacking attitude to gun safety.Mr Forster argued any burglars could have accessed the weapon.ldquoI donrsquot say there is any moral turpitude attached to this misconduct, Mr Forster said, but added the excuse of forgetfulness ldquosimply just wonrsquot do in these circumstances.A former chair of the Scottish Tories who became Advocate General and a le peer in , Lord |Keen alst month represented the UK Government at the Supreme Court over the prorogation of Parliament.He is also the Ministry of Justice spokesperson for the Lords.However it was said that Lord Keen is held by the same standards as all members of the Bar Standards Board.Mr Forster continued: ldquoItrsquos a factor who he is but that does not mean he is treated dferently than any other barrister.ldquoHe canrsquot be held to a higher standard than anyone  who is a member of the bar of England and Wales.Mr Forster continued: ldquoItrsquos a factor who he is but that does not mean he is treated dferently than any other barrister.ldquoHe canrsquot be held to a higher standard than anyone  who is a member of the bar of England and Wales.Tom Richards, representing Lord Keen, said the crime did not amount to professional misconduct and was not a serious offence.He said: ldquoLord Keen takes full responsibility for his offence.

That was a rise of % in a year.Renewable heat technologies include solar and geothermal heating and heat pumps which tap into the energy which is permanently present underground.The development came as environment secretary Roseanna Cunningham announced it would establish an advisory  to ensure Scotlands environmental standards arent compromised in the event of a no deal Brexit.The  is to be chaired by Jim Martin, the current chairman of the Scottish Legal Complaints Commission, who will help design the approach the  will take.:Scots natural environment at risk from inadequate Brexit plansIt came after the Herald revealed a report from by Professor Campbell Gemmell, former head of Scottish Environment Protection Agency, warned that Scotlands preparations to protect its world-renowned natural environment after Brexit remain ldquoinadequate and ldquourgent action was needed to address gaps.Mr Wheelhouse admitted in a written answer that investment in renewable heat in Scotland had slowed down because of changes to incentive schemes by the UK Government.And he added: \"The Scottish Government recognises we must go further to support and encourage the uptake of renewable heat.\"Scottish Green energy spokesperson Mark Ruskell said: \"For a government that likes to talk up its eye-catching targets on climate, the SNP remain woefully incapable of actually meeting them.\"It looks very unlikely we will get to the modest ambition of % renewable heat by next year while Sweden is on course to reach %.

These targets have been in place for nearly a decade and yet compared to renewable electricity we have seen glacial progress.\"Financial subsidy, even when it was set at more attractive levels, did not deliver a step change sht to renewable heating, this needs more regulation and sector planning from government.\"Heating accounts for half of Scotlandrsquos energy use ndash and most of that is powered by fossil fuels.Mr Ruskell added: \"Four out of five Scottish households currently use gas central heating. Why on earth are newly built homes still being plugged into the gas grid when keeping Scotlands buildings warm accounts for around half of all energy consumption and climate emissions \"We need a strong policy framework for warm, affordable and zero-carbon homes, such as we propose in the Scottish Green New Deal.\"Mr Wheelhouse said that since , the Scottish Government has invested around pound million in renewable heat schemes through the Low Carbon Infrastructure Transition Programme and the District Heating Loan Fund, helping to reduce emissions and tackle fuel poverty.:Environment charities urge Scotland ban on polycarbonate in tough newclimate changelawsHe said: \"It is encouraging to see that a number of projects have recently come on line and there are a number in the pipeline, which will contribute to an increasing proportion of our heat coming from renewable sources in the next few years.\"The Scottish Government has also set a a target by  of having % of heat for domestic buildings and % of heat and cooling for non-domestic buildings supplied using low carbon technologies, where technically feasible.And Mr Wheelhouse said the Scottish Government had recently launched the pound million Scottish Low Carbon Heat Funding Invitation for local and industrial heat projects and were \"committed to working with stakeholders to develop regulations to ensure that new homes consented from  use renewable or low carbon heat\".He said they were almost three quarters of the way towards an ambition to connect , homes to heat networks - which use a range of renewable energy sources - by .Mr Wheelhouse said next summer the Scottish Government is due to publish a Heat Decarbonisation Policy Statement setting out a \"new pathway for reducing emissions associated with heating our buildings, in line with our climate change targets\".Scotland has been at the forefront of the climate change debate for many years and even more so in the last few months - having agreed to an ambitious target of net zero emission by , five years ahead of the rest of the UK.The progress report on non-electrical heat demand came as the World Wildle Fund warned the country needs to double public spending on home energy efficiency to pound million a yearit is to meet climate crisis targets, warning that the country is moving too slowly to wean itself from planet-destroying gas boilers.The campaign group reckons Scotland needs to double its current level of energy efficiency updates to , a year.The group hired Vivid Economics to calculate how much work needs to get done for Scotland to achieve zero-net carbon by .The economists worked out that, on average, , homes per year will need to have a renewable heating system installed annually between now and . That compares with between , and , homes per year currently.The WWF research echoes work done for ScottishPower, which said that some pound billion will have to be spent by  replacing two million gas boilers with electric heat pumps.A study earlier this year by The Royal Society of Edinburgh, said that Scotland faces \"substantial obstacles\" in the drive to cut carbon while keeping energy supplies reliable and affordable. Tougher rules will need to be put in place making new housing and other buildings more energy efficient.Charles Dundas, chair of Scottish Environment LINK, said of the new advisory : ldquoA No Deal Brexit would leave Scotlandrsquos environment extremely vulnerable, and wersquore delighted that the Scottish Government has made plans to prevent standards slipping.ldquoWe believe that in the longer term it is essential that Scotland has an independent, well-resourced environmental watchdog to uphold environmental protections and hold future governments to account."},{"url":null,"title":"great-british-bake-off-series-10-episode-10-review","story":"IT had been a dramatic day for news. For all those doing a Brenda from Bristol and despairing at the forthcoming festive GeneralElection, there was a place of refuge last night on Channel .A dear place where nice people made scrummy cakes for the simple pleasure of doing so, where no one was called a traitor, and where the losers were not expected to spend the next three years trying to overturn the result.The tenth series started off ten weeks ago with a bakerrsquos dozen of contestants. Now just three remained: Alice, the stressy one Steph, the lacking in confidence one and David, who was wearing trousers far too nice to wipe floury hands on.ldquoIrsquom definitely the underdog, declared David, so immediately he was the one to watch.Steph had her own gameplan going on. \"Come on baking fairies,\" she pleaded. \"Jump on my shoulders.\"The signature challenge was to make the ultimate chocolate cake. ldquoNot just any chocolate cake, said judge Prue Leith, on duty as ever with Paul Hollywood. What would that be, then  A singing and dancing chocolate cake  A world peace-bringing chocolate cake In Davidrsquos case, ldquoultimate meant sloshing in as much booze as possible without setting the hallowed tent on fire.As we watched the three contestants working away frantically, their heads bowed over mixing bowls, one wondered, not for the first time, why no one had to wear a hairnet in Bake Off. Perhaps, being not really of this cruel world, the programme is exempt from lsquoelf and safety regulations.Since this was the final, we got to see short videos of the contestantsrsquo nearest and dearest paying tribute to their loved ones. Stephrsquos mum had had to do a lot of washing up, but didnrsquot mind a bit Alice had been baking since she was knee high to a plate warmer ditto David. Wise move. Contestants have reached a standard which is to all intents and purposes professional.

Alas, Stephrsquos creations were not even once baked, which brought on the first but not the last of the eveningrsquos tears. She had put cold water in her bain-marie when, as any fool with access to Google knows, it should have been hot.Alice was upset as well. Her parents had been at a wedding in Dublin and it looked like they would not be able to get a flight back in time for the final.

For all those doing a Brenda from Bristol and despairing at the forthcoming festive GeneralElection, there was a place of refuge last night on Channel .A dear place where nice people made scrummy cakes for the simple pleasure of doing so, where no one was called a traitor, and where the losers were not expected to spend the next three years trying to overturn the result.The tenth series started off ten weeks ago with a bakerrsquos dozen of contestants. Now just three remained: Alice, the stressy one Steph, the lacking in confidence one and David, who was wearing trousers far too nice to wipe floury hands on.ldquoIrsquom definitely the underdog, declared David, so immediately he was the one to watch.Steph had her own gameplan going on. \"Come on baking fairies,\" she pleaded. \"Jump on my shoulders.\"The signature challenge was to make the ultimate chocolate cake. ldquoNot just any chocolate cake, said judge Prue Leith, on duty as ever with Paul Hollywood.

Perhaps, being not really of this cruel world, the programme is exempt from lsquoelf and safety regulations.Since this was the final, we got to see short videos of the contestantsrsquo nearest and dearest paying tribute to their loved ones. Stephrsquos mum had had to do a lot of washing up, but didnrsquot mind a bit Alice had been baking since she was knee high to a plate warmer ditto David. Wise move. Contestants have reached a standard which is to all intents and purposes professional. You wonrsquot go far on Bake Off these days by merely being able to knock up a simple apple crumble.The technical challenge was to make twice-baked Stilton souffles with fancy crackers. Alas, Stephrsquos creations were not even once baked, which brought on the first but not the last of the eveningrsquos tears. She had put cold water in her bain-marie when, as any fool with access to Google knows, it should have been hot.Alice was upset as well.

This only passes problems on to routes that require vessels with larger capacity, better facilities and better seagoing performance.ldquoDespite the inclement weather last week, it is the case that the freight provision remains inadequate.He added: ldquoShortages and delays which have real tangible financial impacts on our local economy.ldquoWe are committed to continuing to work with the Scottish Government and CalMac to ensure more successful planning and deployment of future ferry services for island communities.A Scottish Government spokesman said: ldquoCalMac, as the operator of the Clyde  Hebrides Ferry Services, manage connections across the ferry network.

Nor can the PM rely on Labour Brexit supporters in the North of England turning Tory ndash not with ldquoBullingdon Boris in charge.Mr Johnson may or may not be a serial liar, but he embodies, unlike his predecessor, Britainrsquos privileged upper classes. The Conservative Party he leads is now further to the right than in the days of Margaret Thatcher.Younger voters positively detest Mr Johnson, whom many regard as a fascist. Just take a wander down the lists on Twitter. They are heavily engaged in politics right now, not just because of the Brexit they loathe, but also because of tuition fees, lack of jobs, unaffordable houses and so on. They are likely to vote in unprecedented numbers this time.The Tories are desperately trying to insist that ldquoausterity is over, but it patently isnrsquot ndash not in the NHS, local services, schools. And anyway, who was responsible for austerity in the first place The UK has been through the longest period of wage stagnation in  years, and with crumbling infrastructure, insecure jobs, rising inequality, there is a lot of ammunition to use against the PM.So, despite its recent incompetence, there is paradoxically everything for Labour to play for. Except of course in Scotland, where the SNP remains very much in charge ndash though since Nicola Sturgeon would probably back a minority Corbyn government, on a Brexit referendum at least, that isnrsquot as bad for Labour as it sounds.Indeed, Labour will have to fight a very bad campaign to leave Mr Johnson with anything like the lead he has right now in the polls. OK ndash that is not at all impossible, given the state of the Labour Party.Labour is at war with itself, and many Labour MPs hate the thought of campaigning for Mr Corbyn. Expect further accusations of anti-Semitism to be raised in the course of a dirty campaign, not least by the many Labour MPs who have left the party because of it.Labour has a ided leadership and Mr Corbyn is already looking and sounding like yesterdayrsquos man. The architect of Labourrsquos much-praised  election manesto, Andrew Fisher, says he wants to quit. The Peoplersquos Vote campaign, which should be helping Labour, is also at war with itself.The SNP too will have to conduct a very bad campaign not to win its expected  seats.

She should probably confine herself to promising to apply for a Section  order, and then focusing on the NHS, housing and ldquothe hated Tories as the SNP leader calls them.This is going to be a fractious election, with bad-tempered voters resenting the interruption to their festive shopping.

But the one that may be most instructive, as the parties line up with their manestos, and we attempt to get some settled verdict on Brexit and its economic consequences, is the th anniversary of the final day of the Wall Street Crash, which marked the start of the Great Depression.Despite the attention devoted to this period, which affected every developed nation for more than a decade, and made the austerity programmes of the past few years look like Viv Nicholson singing Big Spender in a luxury car showroom, no one agrees, even now, on the lessons to be learnt from it.Reckless speculation, easy credit, an asset price bubble, government intervention, protectionism and failures of the banking system were the main components, but even so some economists argue that the Wall Street Crash wasnrsquot the real cause of the Depression .If all of that seems vaguely familiar, itrsquos because it happened again notably  years ago, on Black Monday, when the Dow Jones had its largest-ever one-day drop and . trillion dollars was wiped off the world economy. If that seems too distant, itrsquos just  years ago this month that Congress passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and Washington Mutual, and the bail-out of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Those were the US government-backed outfits which were supposed to provide security for the mortgage market ndash and were themselves set up in the s under the New Deal designed to end the Depression.And where are we after the Great Recession the  crash sparked  Practically nothing seems to have changed. The nationalised banks are back in private ownership, continuing to pay enormous bonuses and generally behaving as they did before. The UKrsquos national debt, . per cent of GDP in , is now . per cent of GDP, or about pound. trillion. About  per cent of bonds issued globally ndash  trillion worth ndash actually guarantee a loss, something that may remind you of the creative packaging of subprimedebt that kicked off the last crisis. A decade on, interest rates and growth are still on the floor, deflation looms, and monetary policy is broken.The response of the political parties to this state of affairs ishellip to promise to spend money like water. Unsurprisingly, Jeremy Corbynrsquos plans are the worst: Labourrsquos proposed nationalisations have been costed at pound billion just to set up, even before the companies concerned start losing money, as state-run firms tend to while there will be lots more money for all the usual suspects, such as the NHS, schools, and public sector workers.But even the parties that donrsquot advocate the full Venezuela treatment have absurdly expensive plans. The SNPrsquos fiscal estimates, so critical when it comes to Brexit or Westminster, go sharply into starry-eyed optimism when it suits them. The Tories, who correctly insisted that austerity was necessary, are now finding money all over the placefor plans of dubious value, like HS, or Borisrsquos peculiar enthusiasm for very expensive bridges.The battle of economic ideas that used to ide the parties has been displaced by political issues such as Brexit or Scottish independence. These, of course, have economic elements, but they are intrinsically unknowable and cheerfully ignored, skewed, inflated or played down by all sides, because their commitment is partisan, rather than an assessment of economic reality.We hear endlessly of the likely catastrophic impact of a no-deal Brexit, for example, but very little about Germanyrsquos current industrial crisis, the continuing fissures in the Eurozone, or the fact that both Italy and Francersquos real economy debt puts them on the verge of bankruptcy. Meanwhile, the Tories are already promising to spend hypothetical benefits of trade deals that donrsquot yet exist.Alas, any election will be dominated by political issues, such as the competence of the leaders, accusations of obstruction, claims to represent ldquothe people and, God help us, Brexit and independence. All the parties, on current form, will offer the Moon on a stick, with no regard to the cost. Every party, even the incumbents, will also go heavily for the first of the campaign priorities James Carville devised for Bill Clinton: ldquoChange, versus more of the same.

By the autumn of  something like  emaciated seabirds are thought to have washed up on the beaches of St Paul Island, a tiny volcanic speck of Alaska half way to Russia.American scientists were horried: an iconic species was starving. The puffinsrsquo food, they said, was moved away as the once frigid waters of the north heated up.Seabirds are like canaries in a mine, a barometer species. Their fate - like that of the mass mortalities of Pacic puffins - tell as much about the climate emergency as any researchersrsquo temperature graph.Scottish scientists are now watching our own Atlantic puffins, near cousins of the critters on St Paul Island. And they are worried. Populations are dwindling.This summer there were concerns over how many puffins were on the Isle of May in the Firth of Forth. It lost a third of its birds between  and . Why  As in St Paul, it is all about climate change and food.Puffins eat sandeels. And sandeels eat tiny zoo plankton. But whatthe zoo plankton are not there to be eaten Scientists at Marine Scotland, the Scottish Governmentrsquos fisheries protection quango, yesterday published research getting underneath the effects of global heating on the predators and prey.Sandeel larvae usually hatch close to the start of a ldquobloom in their prey, the eggs of tiny crustaceans called copepods. Crudely, baby sandeels have plenty to eat. Or at least used to.Now warmer waters seems to mean that copepods, the favourite dinner of sandeels, will not be blooming when sandeels hatch.Marine Scotland scientists, published in Nature, look at ious scenarios for sea temperature rises.The researchers warn warmer temperatures would create a situation where the larvae hatch days after their first meal was abundantly available.In a ldquoworst case scenario, the scientists said the eel larvae might fail to get enough energy from their first feed and then suffer ldquohigh mortality rates.Scientists call this a ldquotrophic mismatch, the gap between a predator being born peckish and their prey being available for them to eat.The study drew on data gathered by Marine Scotlandrsquos Scottish Coastal Observatory monitoring site at Stonehaven in Aberdeenshire, and yearly winter assessment surveys conducted from a research ship.Previous research has looked in general terms at populations of prey and predator rather than focusing on the trophic mismatch.But, as in the Bering Sea, for most of us the most visible consequences of changing sea temperatures are in birds colonies.It is far harder to trace moving fish or plankton populations under the waves.Marine Scotland, meanwhile, also has trouble keeping track of one of the other factors in the health of the seas: commercial fishing.The agency has decided to take to the skies to cover the seas. It has put out a a tender h for ready-to-fly drone systems ldquodesigned for vessel-based operations on its three fisheries protection craft, Minna, Jura and Hirta.It said the drones would ldquoimprove MPV [marine protection vessel] capability in monitoring activity in the marine environment, without altering or influencing the behaviour of the subject prior to inspection by a boarding party.The value of the contract, due to run from  December to the end of March , is estimated at pound. million.Drones were previously used by Marine Scotland a number of times between  and  for compliance purposes, but they were deployed in ldquoresponse to a particular fishery issue which no longer requires their use.Marine Scotland is also looking to upgrade the three vessels with camera equipment to record fishing activity during daylight hours and also at night.The agency hopes to be able to record footage at a relatively long distance, with thermal imaging involved.That contract - which is likely to run from the end of December through to  March  - has an estimated value of pound,.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoWe take protection of the marine environment very seriously and these two contracts are part of our ongoing commitment to enhance our capability at sea.The UK was earlier this year revealed to be ldquothe biggest culprit in the EU for overfishing.

For it is very clear that the uncertainties around both Brexit and the potential for a second independence referendum, are factors acting as a drag on Scotland’s economic performance. But that doesn’t tell the whole story.Last week the respected Fraser of Allander Institute issued an economic commentary looking at Scottish performance in the context of the United Kingdom as a whole. They pointed to evidence of the negative impact of political uncertainty: business investment in the UK having now been negative in five of the past six quarters, and both consumer confidence and risk-appetite amongst businesses being weak.A deal with the EU will, according to Fraser of Allander, help lt some of the fog of uncertainty that has hung over the Scottish and UK economies in recent times, and deliver a short-term economic boost. The impact of Brexit in the longer term will depend upon the exact terms of the future relationship with the EU.: Fraser of Allander report paints mixed picture for Scottish business: Extra income from Scots tax rises ‘wiped out by slow wage growth’If we burrow deeper into the economic commentary’s findings, we learn that there are specically Scottish concerns which cannot be attributed solely to Brexit. Scotland’s annual growth rate is now just . per cent, compared to that of the UK as a whole at . per cent. Since , the Scottish economy has grown at four per cent compared to five per cent in the UK and seven per cent in the EU. And, while some of the recent weakness in the Scottish economy can be pinned on Brexit uncertainty, the actual trend in activity since early  is broadly in line with the period between  and . So even before the EU referendum, the Scottish economy was underperforming the UK average, and that trend is simply continuing.Tens of thousands without jobsThe employment figures tell a similar story. In the three months to August, Scottish unemployment jumped . per cent, and employment fell by . per cent. This means that Scottish unemployment is higher than the UK average, and the employment rate at . per cent substantially below that of the UK at . per cent. That represents tens of thousands of adults of working age who could be making an economic contribution and paying taxes, but are not currently doing so.Whilst it may be very convenient for SNP ministers to blame all of Scotland’s economic woes on Brexit, the facts simply do not fit this narrative. There is something  going on here, above and beyond our departure from the EU.When we look at business confidence in Scotland, political uncertainty is being caused not just by doubts about the future post-Brexit, but concerns about the prospect of a second independence referendum. With no certainty as to what currency we might use post-independence, how we would fill the fiscal gap of £. billion, or what our trading relationship would be with our largest export market in the rest of the UK, it is no wonder that Nicola Sturgeon’s relentless drive for indyref is having a negative impact both on business and on consumer confidence.Financial executives filled with horrorDespite all this there are key strengths to the Scottish economy. There was a palpable sense of positivity and optimism at the Scottish Financial Enterprise annual dinner last week, with businesses across the sector showcasing dynamism, innovation and investment in skills. This is a sector where Scotland’s reputation has always been strong, and there is no sign of that changing anytime soon.For many of those I spoke to at that dinner, whilst Brexit uncertainty is a concern, it is issues closer to home that they regard as more of a threat. The prospect of an independent Scotland running a dferent currency from the UK is one which fills financial industry executives with horror, and would inevitably lead to a substantial exodus of capital, and with it thousands of well-paid jobs.The SNP’s tax regime, ensuring that anyone earning above £, pays higher taxes than the rest of the UK, is also an ongoing concern. For young ambitious, talented, highly mobile iniduals, levels of taxation are a factor in determining where they accept job offers, andwe continue to see a growing ergence between Scottish tax rates and those where in the UK then the impact on Scottish business is bound to be negative.Fraser of Allander concludes in its report that there is need for a more open discussion of the underlying growth dynamics of the Scottish economy. That is a debate that the Scottish Conservatives are up for. Our Scottish Future Growth Council has already published a suite of proposals on how to improve productivity in our economy, and will shortly be producing its second report on shting our economic performance into a higher gear. Bringing in serious measures to tackle our economic underperformance, rather than simply blaming the Brexit bogeyman, is what is going to make a real dference in the future.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"when a focus group heard this fact about brexit there was horrified silence alex cole hamilton msp","story":"The public are being duped over Brexit by both the Tories and the SNP, writes Alex Cole-Hamilton MSP.Somewhere, in a windowless room of a national opinion polling organisation, the answers offered by a recent focus group uncovered a worrying reality.When asked a series of questions about Boris Johnson’s new Brexit ‘deal’ the carefully selected cross-section of the UK public demonstrated a fundamental misunderstanding as to what is actually going on. The research discovered that almost universally, those asked thought that the ‘deal’ being examined at Westminster represented not just the terms of our withdrawal from the European Union but the entirety our future trading and political relationship with the bloc.When told that this was just the beginning and that Brexit itself would trigger years of detailed, high-stakes negotiations and trade talks– the response was a “horried silence”.It demonstrates the mistaken, yet widely held belief that “getting Brexit done” will conclude with the passage of a withdrawal agreement. Yet in reality, the wrangling, the double-dealing and the persistent threat of crashing out without a deal after the transition period are set to go on and on and on.: Brexit: Boris Johnson is learning same lessons as Theresa May – Ian Swanson: Brexit: England seems to be declaring independence from UK – Angus RobertsonPart of the cause of this confusion is that very few political parties are being straight with the public right now, either about what is going on in the Brexit endgame, or how they feel about it.Take the Prime Minister. In , Theresa May proposed what was, effectively, the same withdrawal agreement as the one on the table right now. She was derided for it by both Boris Johnson and the Brexiteer wing of the Conservative Party. DoublethinkNow he is at the helm, Johnson has discovered the unassailable boundaries of Brexit and has reheated the same solution to the Irish border problem. Northern Ireland will be both simultaneously inside and outside of the EU customs union, depending on your point of view – “Schrödinger’s Ulster” as the commentator Alex Massie recently put it.Scottish Tories have rushed to embrace this policy and with it the doublethink of their new leader. When Theresa May first proposed special treatment for Northern Ireland in its relationship with the EU, Ruth Davidson and David Mundell threatened to resign their positions in response to the threat they believed it represented to the Union.But a poll of Tory members earlier this year suggested that delivering Brexit was more important to them than preventing Scottish independence. The self-proclaimed s of the Union are now pedalling a policy that dramatically heightens the risk of another Scottish border poll and all that comes with it.The mask is beginning to slip for the SNP as well. For three years, Nicola Sturgeon has sought to court Remain voters who voted No in . She’s been desperate to point to independence as a leboat back to the EU . But the First Minister’s ‘stop Brexit’ credentials are starting to ring rather hollow.It emerged last week that her party spent considerably more money chasing , votes in the Shetland by-election than they did campaigning for . million votes in the EU referendum. And people have forgotten that it took them nearly two years to join the campaign for a referendum on the final terms of Brexit. Now that a second referendum might just make it into the Withdrawal Billthey have gone strangely quiet on that front. Instead they appeared to have opted for a swashbuckling push for a snap General Election out of what appears to be a narrow self-interest.No wonder people find politics infuriating right now. They just want political parties to be straight with them about the seismic choices we face as a nation. That starts by reminding them in no uncertain terms that the best deal we could ever hope to strike with the EU is the one we currently enjoy as a full and active member and that the best way to “get Brexit done” is to do away with Brexit completely.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit pm s deal could leave every scot 1600 worse off claims snp","story":"The assessment estimates that under the free trade agreement envisaged in the deal, GDP would be .% lower in  years time compared to forecasts under continued EU membership.The analysis also states that the potential for delays to trade and non-tarf barriers, such as country of origin rules and regulatory alignment, could leave food and drink, digital and service sectors particularly vulnerable.Presenting the new assessment to the Scottish Parliament, Constitutional Relations Secretary Michael Russell told MSPs: ldquoThe paper we have published today sets out the impact of this disastrous deal on Scotland. It removes any pretence that the UK intends to seek a future relationship with the EU beyond a limited free trade agreement.ldquoThe Fraser of Allander Institute estimates that Scotlandrsquos economy is already around two per cent smaller - £ billion - than it would have been without the vote to leave the EU and, letrsquos be clear, this exit deal does not in any way lsquoget Brexit donersquo. It would merely unleash fresh, ever more complex and ever more acrimonious disputes on the population.\"The likelihood is that it merely postpones a lsquono dealrsquo crash out for little over a year.\"Mr Russell said that by granting Northern Ireland continued access to the Single Market, the deal puts Scottish companies at a competitive disadvantage. He also said that failed to address an expected decline in Scotlands working age population caused by the ending freedom of movement for people.In an increasingly heated Chamber, with cries of \"rubbish\" from the Tory seats, Mr Russell said the new Brexit deal was now at the heart of the upcoming election campaign, and added: ldquoThe UK Government has repeatedly failed to live up to its promises to fully involve the devolved administrations in the Brexit negotiations. The result is a bad deal which will damage Scotlandrsquos interests and ignores our democratic will.ldquoThe people of Scotland have the right to determine their own future free from Brexit as an independent member of the European Union.However Mr Russells presentation of the impact analysis in Holyrood was branded a \"party political broadcast in the most hysterical and ridiculous terms\" by Scottish Tory economy spokesman, Murdo Fraser. Raising the issue with the Presiding Officer Ken McIntosh, he said: \"Ministerial statements are to inform Parliament, they should not be used as a  minute party political broadcast on behalf of the Scottish National Party. Im aware we have a general election on its way, but parliamentary must not be abused in this fashion.\"Mr McIntosh urged MSPs \"not to bring election politics too much into this chamber, please keep election campaigning outside the chamber and keep the chamber for government business.\"Scottish Tory constitutional spokesman Adam Tomkins, said he had expected apologies from Mr Russell and Nicola Sturgeon for their previous statements that Boris Johnson would not achieve a deal.He added: \"The truth is Mike Russell called for a transition period. Boris Johnsons new deal provides for one. Mike Russell called for no hard border on the island of Ireland, Boris Johnsons new deal ensures we wont have one. Nicola Sturgeon called for a guarantee on EU citizens rights and Boris Johnsons new deal provides it.\"Is it not the case the SNP rail against this deal because they want the most chaotic Brexit possible  Is it not the case they want a no-deal Brexit, because the only thing they care about is independence and they think the shortest route to independence is a no-deal Brexit \"Mr Russell said he had constantly opposed a no-deal Brexit. He added: \"I wish to see an end to Brexit and of course Mr Tomkins used to wish to see no Brexit originally, its a pity hes walked away from that for purely party advantage.\"Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said that it was \"incredulous\" the Conservative MSPs were defending a deal which \"puts a border in the Irish Sea, when they condemned that deal last year.\"But he added: \"Im puzzled that the minister states that breaking from the EU will bedisaster but breaking from the UK will be of benefit. Does he not get it by now that putting up borders and barriers costs jobs and the economy, that we need to learn the lessons of Brexit, not repeat them with independence \"Mr Russell said that the Liberal Democrats no longer had a plan to stop Brexit. \"His only plan was to have a second referendum and we would still support that referendum,were there a prospect of it succeeding,\" he said.He said Mr Rennie had \"consistently failed to address the central question\", that \"because he cannot guarantee in any sense that there would be a defeat for the forces of Brexit now or in the future, theres only one surefire way of getting Brexit finished and moving on as a normal nation, and that is independence.\"Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie raised the downgrade of commitments to provide a lsquolevel playing fieldrsquo with Europe in the new Brexit deal. He said: ldquoLiz Truss, the trade secretary, said that scrapping those protections is vital to giving the Tories the freedom and flexibility to strike new trade deals.On the same day an unnamed cabinet source said the level playing field policy lsquohas to gorsquo because lsquoit would seriously restrict our ability to deregulatersquo.ldquoIf that Withdrawal Bill is put forward after this general election, we face the very real threat that the Scottish Parliament may be unable to protect Scotland from this kind of hard right extremist ideology.

Now, how about a bit of investment in tidal and hydrogen generation. The Sullom Voe four dual-fuel gas turbine generators could be updated and expanded to eight. That should easily supply power for immediate use and cut our carbon footprint in half.Let us see how the Green loonies ponder this one I have just crunched a few figures! The cost of the interconnector would pay for four Shetland power stations. Now one gas-fired would leave acool £, million for research and education. Rock on Viking Energy and goodbye.In Ian Tinkler’s mind the phrase “Green loonies” is meaningful. Can anyone  explain who his loonies are, or do they only exist in his imagination   If the phrase is only meaningful to Ian it is dficulty to see how “sanity is taking over at last”.Very appropriate for the idiots who wasted £ million SCT funds and now want to throw £ million more at windfarm Shetland. Characterising those behind Viking Energy as silly, mad or idiotic is simplistic, inaccurate and unhelpful.Some, but certainly not all, of the backersand approvers were incorrectly motivated by honestly held environmental concerns.Tom Morton’s name springs to mind.Ian Tinkler’s phrase, “Green loonies”, does nothing, however, to capture the aice that motivated some of the others who, vocally or secretly, also backed the scheme.Neither does Ian’s phrase address the  “development-at-all-costs” notion that the council must always be on a mission to find and back the next big thing.Their job should instead be to see things are fairly considered.Ian may be right to argue the inter-connector is unaffordable, that Shetland needs an intermediary gas-fired power station # possibly en-route to a publicly owned eco-grid # but he’s foolish to garble so important a message.An independent commission may be needed to look at how Shetland’s future energy needs can best be met.The council could have a role in calling for one.And Ian Tinkler can retain his self-stimulating role in calling others silly names at random for his own pleasure.As for “snowflake”, well bless his cotton socks.Would he could stick to his point.In all seriousness, I wince when I read the word ‘ loonies’ in these columns.

I could go on but the Big Girls Blouses of the PR brigade may be offended. That would be tough on Girly Swots.!!! Sorry for the windup folks, I do not suffer pretentious fools all that well.Side comment : I believe when Sullom Voe, was being planned, an arrangement was negotiated where SV could supply gas, via pipeline, to the power station here in Lerwick, at very little cost, thus the cost of power to the people of Shetland, becoming one,not the only, cheapest source of energy for the consumer. However, the get out clause, the Hydro-Board, asked BP could the guarantee % supply  No surprise, BP said # No. #. That being said, we, Shaetlanders# were denied a cheaper cost of energy and a cost of living. I believe. Could this arrangement still be in the pipeline as an alternative to Viking Energyin providing a cheap source of energy Well Ian, that was almost an apology laced with get # out clauses.!!Making references to the so called PR brigade and Big Girls’ Blouses does nothing to assuage people who deliver their opinions in reasonable, measured tones.To attack with great relish says a great deal more about the attacker than the attacked. One can very readily understand why so much intolerance in the world makes it an unsafe place.Being proud of such a weakness merely serves to compound the problem.With patience and a large slice of contrite thinking, things could repair and meaningful exchanges COULD take place.Roll on.Since May . The  MWe plant has four  MW General Electric Frame  gas turbines . It may be more cost-effective to modernise and expand this plant at Sullom than build a gas pipe to Lerwick. Unless I am mistaken a connecting power line is cheaper and less environmentally damaging than a pipeline. If Shetland ever gets its renewable act together this plant would act as the backup power station until a non-fosil fuel plant was established. A tidal generation would be the obvious solution with hydrogen back up and storage used for transport and energy storage.Thank you Ian, for your comments. directly coming from Sullom Voe Haydn makes a worthwhile point. We shouldn’t be contributing in harmfully in ways that feed stigma around issues of mental health.People should not feel discouraged from seeking help that could be le saving.

I suspect the staff periodically consider such issues and wouldn’t be troubled by the prospect of being considered “Big Girls Blouses”or indeed “pretentious fools” were they to cut less slack.It is also possible to become desensitised, even to such annoyances as the distracting sound of a dentist’s excessive drill.The profit motive aside, I can’t see the subsea cable being preferable to Shetland becoming self sufficient through sustainable renewables..."},{"url":null,"title":"electrical engineer electrician at scale aq ","story":"• Experience working within aquaculture is desirable but not essential as training will be given.• Full driving licence is essential.• ScaleAQ offer a competitive salary, private healthcare and training development opportunities.ScaleAQ is the result of  years of experience and consists of Steinsvik, Aqualine and AquaOptima.

The proposal was supported by the two SNP councillors in the Barra and South Uist Ward and the five SNP councillors from Lewis and Harris.”In his statement, Councillor MacMillan also accused Labour Highlands and Islands MSP Rhoda Grant of calling for a government inquiry into the issue as a means of “taking the focus” off of comhairle convenor Councillor Norman A MacDonald # whom he described as a “Labour party colleague” to Rhoda Grant # and who has voted, according to Councillor MacMillan, to back the Uist dental plan.Councillor MacMillan added: “Rhoda Grant#s proposal for an inquiry is a politically motivated ersionary tactic designed to prevent the truth about Labour Party councillors voting to close the medical provision at Uist Hospital.“Rhoda Grant should instead call for the Western Isles NHS to start telling the truth, to publish the voting record of the [Integration Joint Board]meeting and explain the real reason for centralising the dental provision into the Uist Hospital which is to close the Operating Theatre and Resuscitation Room to remove the surgical capacity from the hospital.”Responding to the claims, Norman A MacDonald stated that he wasn#t present at the last IJB meeting, and said that “assurances had been given” that the relocation of the dental service in Uist would have “no detrimental impact on the Uist and Barra hospital whatsoever.The convenor added: “After the original vote at the IJB on this matter resulted in a split vote, from then on it was up to the chief executives to decide what would take place.“I have no idea what kind of influence Councillor MacMillan might think I have, as both Uist and Barra hospital and the Western Isles Hospital hospital are solely the responsibility of the health board and it is not for councillors to make any decisions on their future.“I have never discussed in any shape or form either the dental service in Uist or her call for an inquiry with Rhoda Grant.“As to the colour of my politics, Councillor MacMillan#s claims are equally questionable. I have registered for the last fteen years as an independent councillor.”Mrs Grant said: “Councillor MacMillan#s assertion would be laughable were it not such a serious issue in question.“I have, from the outset in , listened to the concerns being raised by constituents, by the Uist Locality Planning Group, by the Association of Community Councils, by a stakeholder event held in Lochboisdale, and by all local elected members serving when this proposal to centralise dental services was first aired.“I have repeatedly made representation to the IJB, to NHS Western Isles, to the comhairle, to the previous Health Secretary, and to the First Minister.“Health boards and local authorities throughout Scotland are having to make incredibly dficult decisions to fit with the reducing budgets they are being given and perhaps Councillor MacMillan, instead of throwing meaningless insults around, would do better focusing on bringing this to the attention of his colleagues in the Scottish Government, opposing jobs and services being taken out of local communities.“This is an appalling decision, which flies in the face of local democracy, and constituents in Uist deserve to have their concerns heard, and heeded.”Officially, it was something called the Integration Joint Board that made the announcement at the end of last month: all roads will soon lead to Balivanich. But the IJB began le as a creature of the big boys it is staffed by officials from both public agencies. Is its independence nominal  It#s hard to be sure.Whatever the limits of its power, it is a useful fig leaf to hide behind. The barrage of flak directed at this rotten decision to centralise a vital health service can be dodged by the likes of NHS Western Isles chief executive Gordon Jamieson. The plan to close three dental surgeries came from the IJB. At least that#s how it was sold to the public.Before too long, everyone in the Uists will have to go to hospital in Balivanichthey need a filling or a tooth extracted. So much for the “professional concerns” comhairle chief executive Malcolm Burr has supposedly spent that last six months mulling over. At the end of September, he fell into line. Unanimity was required in order to proceed, and he delivered it.One particular paragraph from the IJB decision paper is worth quoting in full: “Given his familiarity with the subject matter, the chief executive of NHS Western Isles was able to come to an early view about the best arrangements for the provision of dental services in Uist but the chief executive of the comhairle, having no previous experience of these services, required more time to familiarise himself with the detail.”This admission is revealing. Completely out of his depth, it took Mr Burr six months to swot up on the intricacies of closing three dental surgeries before wielding the axe. In doing so, he perhaps exposed the limits of integrating health and social care, which is the IJB#s raison d#etre. Put simply, it should not be the responsibility of someone with no background in health care to make a decision like this. The IJB say there will be an “outreach” service aimed primarily at South Uist and Eriskay, the latter  miles away from Balivanich along single-track roads. What this pledge means, in dental terms, is still to be decided. Perhaps teeth can be extracted safely in the back of a van.If the fruits of integration — a much-hyped national paradigm — are vandalism on this scale, then we suggest a rethink is in order. The hybrid organisations driving the agenda don#t seem to be accountable to anyone, least of all the voters.Speaking of which, we are glad to see that Western Isles MSP Alasdair Allan has had a quiet word with Public Health Minister Joe Fitzpatrick about referring the matter to the Scottish Government. Ultimately, it is Health Secretary Jeane Freeman who has the power to stop this. Hopefully, she#ll use it before Stornoway wrecks a system that has worked well for decades."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MOD-GLW-19-GOLD-MEDAL-1.jpg","title":"both of this years gold medals are won by glasgow","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineAfter  years living in the city, Claire and family were due to move back to her native Ness in Lewis on Monday.The -year-old teacher had previously won the Traditional Gold when the mòd was in Stornoway in .

If Edinburgh and Skye do suffer from overtourism, what can we do about it  In a free country, we cannot stop people from coming here, evenwe wanted to.It should also be recognised that folk visit those two places for dferent reasons. Edinburgh is an architectural jewel which is at its most crowded during the annual festival. People come to Skye for the scenery — most notably in recent years to the Trotternish Ridge and the Fairy Pools, two undeniably beautul spots in an island which is full of other undeniably beautul spots.Edinburgh cannot be expected to cancel its festival, any more than we want to drain the Fairy Pools or blow up the Old Man of Storr.And we do not want to stop them coming. They bring money, which provides jobs and kickstarts enterprises and improves the island#s economic wellbeing even outside the realm of the local tourist industry.Professor John Lennonof Glasgow Caledonian University#s Moffat Centre is presently commissioned by another independent body, SkyeConnect, to carry out a major survey of the impact of tourism on Skye.Professor Lennon and his colleagues are not due to deliver their report until next spring. But he will offer a taste of its findings so far to the autumn conference of SkyeConnect next month.We look forward to both the sample and the full report. We can hazard a guess at some of its content.Skye has been #discovered# by the rest of the world, like a Caledonian Machu Picchu.Unlike the Peruvian Inca site, however, Skye is a very big island. Unlike Machu Picchu, it is not yet collapsing under the weight of its visitors# feet.Skye can — and Mark Crothall congratulated the Skyetime campaign for pointing this out — accommodate half a million visitors, and continue to benefit hugely from their spending, particularlycertain adjustments are made to the tourist itinerary.More people should be encouraged to spend a quiet and infinitely rewarding week in Elgol or Waternish, in all four seasons, than take a whistle-stop, bucket list summer tour of the Storr, the Fairy Pools and back to the bridge.And of course, local and national government should do much more to improve the basic infrastructure of the island, from roads and parking areas to public transport and public toilets.Skye has bucked the trend of the rest of the north-western Highlands and Islands by growing its population and its economy in recent years.That has chiefly been because of the tourist industry. After  years of steady and apparently irreversible decline, the growth quite naturally took everybody by surprise. We should now learn to adapt to it, rather than call it #overtourism# and hope that it goes away."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/001WH2510NCA-web.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 25th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

This project was part funded under Priority of the Northern Ireland Rural Development Programme - from the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs and the European Union.Chair of SOAR ABC Roisin McAliskey added: “This project has been completed to an exceptionally high standard, and is exemplary ofhow funds from SOAR’s Rural Village Renewal scheme can be used to support the implementation of local village plans.”Open to the public since July, the new trail is already proving to be a popular destination for walkers, runners and cyclists.Welcoming completion of the trail, Jerome Burns, Contracts Manager, Southern Rural Affairs Division at the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs  said: “This trail has been completed as part of a suite of village enhancement measures financed through the Village Renewal strand of the Leader Rural Development Programme. It provides a great opportunity for everyone to enjoy the many benefits of outdoor activity, and it is an excellent example of how DAERA is delivering on its vision of a ‘living, working, active landscape valued by everyone.”Given its proximity to Gilford Community Centre, this marvellous amenity set in an attractive riverside setting greatly complements the centre with its excellent indoor and outdoor facilities including a climbing wall, trim trail, picnic tables, pump track, canoe landings and beginners’ canoe slalom course.Alternative Heat are set to expand the firm Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"The council acknowledges with thanks the co-operation of the owners of Gilford Mill, Karl Asset Management, which enabled this project to proceed along with The MWA Partnership Ltd, Landscape Architects and A.G.

He blamed his work patterns, skipping breakfast, grabbing food out and eating all the wrong food for his weight gain.“I’d heard about Slimming World before from my we who had friends who were very successful so I knew it worked,” said Peter. “I was worried because I thought it would just be me and a roomful of women. Actually that wasn’t far from the truth as there were other men in the group, it didn’t matter though because everyone was so friendly and it only took a few weeks before I felt right at home. “I’m so glad I didn’t let my nerves stop me from losing weight.“I expected to feel hungry but in my first week I couldn’t believe how much I was eating and I still lost pounds. I haven’t looked back since.”He began following Slimming World’s Food Optimising eating plan and swapped his bought sandwiches and takeaways for healthy home-cooked meals and is now a keen cyclist.“I used to think that losing weight meant eating nothing but salad, which definitely didn’t appeal to me,” he said. “Food Optimising isn’t a diet though, it’s a lestyle change. I mainly still eat the same meals that I did beforehand, like curries, roast dinners and pasta dishes, but I make them in a more healthy way now like using low calorie cooking spray instead of oil or butter and I eat a lot more fruit and vegetables.”Caroline, who runs the Dromore group which Peter attends, hopes he will inspire other men in the area who want to lose weight: “Blokes might think that coming to a slimming club is a bit ‘girly’. “I hope Peter will show that lots of dferent people come along to our groups and each and every one gets a warm and friendly welcome.

MPs votedfor the election by a mammoth margin of  votes to .Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is ready to fight a “tough” election while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the snap poll is a “once-in-a-generation” opportunity to transform the country.DUP Leader Arlene Foster said it is right the people of Northern Ireland have their say through the ballot box.“The DUP will use this opportunity to campaign strongly to send a message that Northern Ireland is better in the Union of the United Kingdom and we cannot be separated economically from Great Britain,” she said.“We have a record of speaking up for Northern Ireland in Westminster and delivering for everyone in Northern Ireland.“At a time of great uncertainty as to who will form the next government how Northern Ireland votes will matter as never before.“Unionists need their strongest team ed to so that Northern Ireland’s interests are protected in the next Parliament.That team is the DUP.“This election will matter and we will be campaigning for every vote as we take our message to the people.”Reacting to news of a pre-Christmas election, Sinn Féin Leader in the North Michelle O’Neill said it is an opportunity to reject the DUP, reject the Tories and reject the destructive role of Westminster on the north. “It is a welcome opportunity for the people of the north to have their say on the looming disaster of Brexit,” she said.#It is a chance to reject the DUP and the Tories, to reject Brexit and the Westminster chaos and its destructive influence on the north of Ireland.#Sinn Féin has strong candidates who work tirelessly on behalf of their constituents, and we stand ready to fight this election. “Sinn Féin has successfully made the case to the Irish government and Europe that the north’s special circumstances needed to be recognised to protect our economy against the Brexit catastrophe, to avoid any hardening of the border and to protect the Good Friday Agreement. “The DUP have ignored the democratic wishes of the people of the north, of business, of farmers, of retailers. The people of the north did not consent to Brexit. “There is no good Brexit for Ireland. “Westminster is in chaos. It has no answers and no solutions.“The Brexit debacle has shown that Westminster cannot, has not and will never act in the interests of the people of the north. “Your interests in this election are best served by voting Sinn Féin for a dferent future by sending a clear message to the British government that we want control of our own future through a referendum on Irish unity.#Alliance Leader Naomi Long said her party is best-placed to unite Remain voices.“This election will be mainly focused around Brexit and Alliance has always been clear there is no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit,” she said.“Therefore it will be an opportunity for people to have their say and elect MPs who want to avoid a hard border, protect the Good Friday Agreement and attend Westminster to represent their interests. “We are uniquely placed to do that, as the Alliance surge seen in May’s local government and European Elections showed the party could reach across all sections of our community and gain support from everywhere.“We have been preparing for an election for some time, as it is clear this Parliament is hopelessly ided and the Government has no legitimacy. Northern Ireland voted to Remain. “If people vote for Alliance candidates, we can increase the representation of progressive, pro-Remain MPs and articulate that voice loudly at Westminster.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"pipe bomb detonated in west belfast garden","story":"WEST Belfast MP Paul Maskey has condemned a “reckless attack” on a house in West Belfast.A pipe bomb-type device detonated in the front garden of a house at Aitnamona Crescent around .pm on Saturday night.The occupant of the house reported hearing what they believed to be a firework going off.

That team is the DUP.“This election will matter and we will be campaigning for every vote as we take our message to the people.”Incoming Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken, who has attracted criticism by ruling out his party stepping aside in certain constituencies — including North Belfast — to allow DUP candidates a clear run, said Northern Ireland needs to elect UUP MPs who will stand against the Prime Minister’s plans, which will destroy the Union. data-dfpadtargetingLady Sylvia HermonHe said: “This is the most important election the people of the United Kingdom have ever faced.“Boris Johnson’s deal with the EU is an existential threat to the Union. It puts a border in the Irish Sea and places Northern Ireland on the window ledge of the Union.“This election will be an opportunity to send Ulster Unionist MPs to Westminster who will not be patsies to a Tory Government or ever agree to a border down the Irish Sea.“Northern Ireland has been betrayed by Boris Johnson’s Conservative Government and we need to send a clear message to him and his advisers that we will not sit back and let him destroy the Union.”Sinn Fein has already selected a number of candidates to contest the long-expected Westminster election, including Belfast Lord Mayor John Finucane to challenge DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds’ slim majority in North Belfast.The party’s vice-president Michelle O’Neill said the vote was an opportunity for people “to have their say on the looming disaster of Brexit”.It is a chance to reject the DUP and the Tories, to reject Brexit and the Westminster chaos and its destructive influence on the north of Ireland.Michelle O’Neill“Sinn Fein has successfully made the case to the Irish Government and Europe that the north’s special circumstances needed to be recognised to protect our economy against the Brexit catastrophe, to avoid any hardening of the border and to protect the Good Friday Agreement.“The DUP have ignored the democratic wishes of the people of the north, of business, of farmers, of retailers.“The people of the north did not consent to Brexit.“There is no good Brexit for Ireland. Westminster is in chaos. It has no answers and no solutions. The Brexit debacle has shown that Westminster cannot, has not and will never act in the interests of the people of the north.”SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the election will be a defining moment for Brexit and every opportunity to defend the interests of people, businesses and communities must be taken.He said: “For three years the democratic decision taken by people in Northern Ireland to reject a border on this island, to maintain the free and frictionless relationship we enjoy with Europe and to sustain our fragile peace has been wilfully ignored by successive Conservative Governments and by the DUP. The coming election is an opportunity to reject the politics of ision and deadlock.“This island’s destiny is being decided at Westminster. Like it or not, the only way to prevent the kind of outcome that would devastate our communities is to show up and vote it down.“Our MPs have, with the exception of Sylvia Hermon, either facilitated this disaster or stood outside on the lawn shouting in.“They have failed to defend our interests. It’s time to give the electorate a chance to cast their verdict on that failure.”Alliance leader Naomi Long said her party is best placed to unite Remain voices here. “This election will be mainly focused around Brexit and Alliance has always been clear there is no such thing as a good or sensible Brexit,” she said.“Therefore it will be an opportunity for people to have their say and elect MPs who want to avoid a hard border, protect the Good Friday Agreement and attend Westminster to represent their interests.“Northern Ireland voted to Remain. If people vote for Alliance candidates, we can increase the representation of progressive, pro-Remain MPs and articulate that voice loudly at Westminster.”A TUV spokesman said: “It has been clear for sometime that this Parliament was incapable of delivering anything. The election is long overdue. \"The Prime Minister says that he will be fighting on the basis of getting “Brexit done” but in support of an agreement which is not Brexit for the whole UK, but only for GB. It would leave Northern Ireland in the waiting room for a united Ireland, with the Union riven by a border down the Irish Sea.\" "},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38646309.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/ENCE30-10-201905.jpg","title":"sinn fein targeting dodds seat as party aim for eight mps with john finucane victory","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Read MoreBrexit timeline: From  referendum promise to a  election Read MoreBrexit timeline: From  referendum promise to a  election Mr Varadkar has repeatedly said that he favours holding a general election in May  and has not publicly commented on the increased speculation of a snap November poll in recent days. A senior Fine Gael source said that Mr Varadkar had \"absolutely\" ruled out a November election at a meeting of the partys senior ministers this morning prior to the weekly Cabinet meeting in Government Buildings. Another source said that Mr Varadkar left zero wriggle room in his remarks to his ministers and that there was no dissent at the meeting.Speaking notes circulated within Fine Gael this morning urge the partys Ministers, TDs and Senators to state that the government is \"pressing ahead with its work programme, creating jobs, growing the economy, and supporting families\" and that the Taoiseach has made clear that May  is his preferred date.With the Brexit deadline extended and an election called in the UK, the Taoiseach has come under pressure from his own ranks to go to the country on November  - the date currently pencilled in for four Dáil by-elections - in recent days. Fine Gael TD and former EU Affairs Minister Dara Murphy broke ranks yesterday to publicly declare that now is the right time for Mr Varadkar to go to the country. He joined the many ministers and Fine Gael TDs who are privately pressuring the Taoiseach to call a snap poll.The Irish Independent reported earlier this week that many Fine Gael Cabinet ministers privately favoured a snap election in November.Party sources also said that preparations for an election were \"very advanced\" with the manesto and staffing arrangements almost finalised. One of Mr Varadkars top advisers, John Carroll, is spearheading preparations.

Trees, woods and forests help people feel better, encourage more active lestyles and alleviate the symptoms of some debilitating conditions. So, it makes perfect sense to combine your daily exercise with a trip to the great outdoors. Derry is home to stunning woodland and riverside walks such as the recently restored Ness Woods with its impressive new adventure playpark for children.You also have Burntollet, Brackfield and Prehen Woods - which dates back to the s – amongst others.A spokesperson for the Woodland Trust expounded on the countless benefits of spending time in woodlands saying scientic studies have shown that “green exercise” can improve self-esteem and mood, as well as reducing stress, anxiety disorders and depression. She explained: “On top of that autumn offers the keen nature watcher the opportunity to enjoy the flurry of wildle gearing up for winter. “At this time of year you can spot migrant fieldfares feeding on hawthorn berries or catch a glimpse of jays burying acorns for winter, which in turn makes them excellent tree planters as they usually leave a few behind. “Combine that with the vibrant autumn colour on offer and what’s not to like about being outside.”She continued: “Prehen Wood is one of the Woodland Trust’s rare and irreplaceable ancient woods, dating back as far as . “The woodland is a natural treasure trove, a place of great beauty offering a peaceful walk along a looped pathway – and all on the doorstep of the city. “Venturing  miles south of the city and into the Faughan Valley you can explore  Woodland Trust woodlands offering beautul walks with picturesque views including Burntollet Wood, Brackfield Wood, Kilaloo Wood, Oaks Wood and Bonds Glen. With neighbours Ness Country Park owned by NIEA this area offers bountul choice for visitors to enjoy.” googletag.cmd.push   Prehen Wood Prehen Wood is a remnant of the extensive woodland that once covered most of the River Foyle from the Craigavon Bridge to County Tyrone. When English planters came to Derry in , Sir Henry Docwra, the then governor, wrote in his memoirs that he sent men daily from the city over to these woods to bring back timber and that they had to fight for it daily.The Wood was once part of the Prehen House Estate, which in  totalled  hectares. After the first world war the estate was sold off in pieces, including the remaining woods, which were sold in  for timber production.A local outcry ensued about the imminent destruction of the woodland and the editor of a local paper took up the cause, calling for some timber to be left standing. Prehen Wood was spared and is viewed as a “green lung” for the people of Derry.With a lot of support from the Prehen Historical and Environmental Society, the Woodland Trust acquired the Woods at Prehen to conserve it for future generations.Prehen Wood made up of beech, oak, ash and birch trees is known for its bluebells, but it also boasts over sixty natural plants species including anemones and orchids, wildle such as long-eared owls, the native red squirrel, badgers and sparrowhawks, as well as a sculpture trail. Solace  Romantic poet, John Keats, in an ode to Autumn described it as the season of mists and mellow fruitfulness.George McLaughlin of the Prehen Historical and Environmental Society recalled that line as he spoke of the beauty of Prehen Woods and invited people to explore local woodlands at this time of year.He said: Where better to be than in Prehen Woods in the Autumn, or at any time of the year, although bluebell time is recognised as the best time of year. Autumn is the next best time to experience our wonderful ancient woodlands.Your impression dfers depending on the time of day you visit, he explained: In the morning when we have the first frost of Autumn you can see intricate patterns of the spiders webs stretching from twig to twig mysteriously created during the night.Early morning is a good time for wildle watching at the aptly named foxes corner of the woodland. You may see one or more of the famous foxes of Prehen or be lucky enough to witness theof the Prehen red squirrel.At midday a heavenly beauty is created by the Autumn sunshine filtering through the canopy of the many ieties of tree. In todays busy world, there is something relaxing and healing about the feeling of solace to be found in an ancient woodland.”Over Halloween the woods take on a dferent complexion, George explained: In the evening time or in the glowing as they call it in Ireland, and especially at Halloween mysterious shadowy figures seem to appear from behind every ancient tree. Are these the famous ghosts of Prehens fabled past The screeching of long eared owls and the raucous call of the jays all add to the seasonal spookiness of the special creation that is Prehen ancient woodland.This Autumn season of mists and fruitfulness certainly rings true of a woodland at this time of year where theres an abundance of berries, nuts, acorns and toadstools to be found.

Loganair also operate direct flights to Manchester and Glasgow, providing air connectivity to the main hubs, and creating an opportunity for onward connectivity. Loganair has just announced a new partnership with Flybe which means you can now travel via Glasgow or Manchester with one single booking from City of Derry Airport to UK and European airports such as East Midlands, Birmingham. Exeter, Southampton, Cardf, Jersey, Duumlsseldorf, Paris Charles de Gaulle or Amsterdam, to name a few. In addition, Loganair provides connectivity to international destinations via Glasgow and Manchester. The interline agreement in place with Emirates provides access to Dubai and the new agreement recently announced with United Airways provides connectivity to American destinations such as New York and Chicago via Glasgow and Manchester. The beauty of this method of travel is that it involved just one single booking and your baggage is taken care of from the start of your journey to your final destination! Mrs Shongo added: “City of Derry Airport has become the airport of choice for the North West of Ireland, offering both convenience and excellent customer service. We have fantastic facilities on our doorstep, and I would encourage all travellers within the local catchment area to think about flight options from their local airport when making future travel arrangements, asking passengers to ‘Fly Local and Choose CoDA’ whenever they can. We have fantastic facilities on our doorstep, and it is essential that everyone takes advantage of their local airport for their travel plans when possible.” For more information on the NEW daily service from City of Derry Airport to London Southend Airport, visit www.cityofderryairport.

A thumping th minute point from Emmett McGuckin put Adrian Cush’s side three points ahead and they were full value for it. Glen, led by skipper Danny Tallon and young gun Alex Doherty, staged a late comeback but the closing stages saw Sunday’s decider, in front of over , fans, end in controversy as the Watties went in search of an equaliser. Shane Heavron squandered a stoppage time free for an insurance point but as the clock ticked towards the end of the allotted extra four minutes, Connor Carville built from a short kick-out. Referee John Joe Cleary seemed to allow Glen one last attack. A final roll of the dice. Connlan Bradley advanced and when Danny Tallon was awarded a free outside the ‘’ he elected to work the ball short. Yet, still play continued. As Glen patiently worked the ball into a scoreable position, the final whistle sounded. As Magherafelt’s celebrations ignited, Ciaran McFaul’s kick seemed to go over the bar but it didn’t count. Glen’s protests fell on deaf ears as a sea of red and white engulfed Celtic Park. While Glen can feel aggrieved at not being given a few additional seconds, they played second fiddle to a cool, calm and collected Magherafelt side for almost  minutes of this decider. The zip that tore Slaughtneil to shreds was absent and once Magherafelt got to grips with the game, it appeared that Glen would need to find the net to land the silver in their first ever final. For the first time in the campaign, Jude Donnelly’s side settled first. After securing possession from the throw-in, they played keep ball for a full three minutes before Emmett Bradley passed to Danny Tallon for the opening score. Ethan and Jack Doherty interchanged before Paddy McLarnon fouled and Paul Gunning doubled the lead. It was the start Glen needed to play the game on their own terms but Magherafelt didn’t flinch.  Wins over Coleraine and their second-half grind against Banagher left them battle-hardened.  From the resultant kick-out Shane Heavron caught brilliantly but when he passed to his brother Danny over the top they looked like carving out an opening. The advantage wasn’t given by referee Cleary, play was called back and Shane fired over from the free. When the industrious John Young got inside Jack Doherty and was fouled, Heavron’s second free levelled the game.  In the th minute, Emmett McGuckin fed Shane Heavron but his low shot lacked conviction and Oisin Hegarty’s foot presented a goal, with Alex Doherty kicking over the first of his four points at the end of a counter-attack. When Paul Gunning hoovered up the break from the kick-out, Doherty booted over another score and Glen were - to - ahead. It was then that Magherafelt began to turn the screw in the game. They hemmed Glen into their own half. The Heavrons were off target and Antone McElhone hit the post but when goalkeeper Mullan-Young fluffed a kick-out, Glen were on the defensive and Cahir McCabe’s push on Shane Heavron handed the Rossa dead-ball specialist the chance to level matters after  minutes. An Emmett Bradley catch led to a Tallon point on the run and Glen were ahead. They could’ve opened a four point lead when Gunning and Emmett Bradley combined. Ethan Doherty was in on goal but the angle favoured Odhraacuten Lynch who stood up until the last minute to make the save. Seconds later, Emmett McGuckin swivelled his hips to buy space before kicking an equaliser. From the kick-out, McGuckin flicked to Danny Heavron, who passed to Antone McElhone for a point. With Glen ‘keeper Callum Mullan-Young struggling with his kick-outs, with a lack of movement outfield and midfield trio of McFaul, Dougan and Bradley unable to won the aerial battle, Glen’s grip on the cup began to slip. Heavron cut out a miscued kick-out to set-up John Young for a point. A further miskick saw Conor Kearns in on goal but Carville’s tackle saved Glen’s bacon. A second turnover of the half from Fergal Duffin began a breakaway, with Danny Heavron setting up his brother Shane for his only effort from play and Magherafelt were - to - ahead at the break. Glen needed an impetus and when Ciaran McFaul grabbed the throw-in, he gave Glen an early spark and Danny Tallon swung a long-range point. The story of the half was Magherafelt’s ability to hold Glen at arm’sand with Odhraacuten Lynch’s assured kicking, they had control of the game.  While Glen ran into Magherafelt’s perfectly laid trap and forced passes that weren’t on, their opponents were squeaky clean in possession. It was all about precision. Magherafelt’s decision to start Conor McCluskey on Jack Doherty was a masterstroke. He constantly forced Glen on the back foot. He added a point but once again Alex Doherty, this time with a crisp left footed effort, fired over to put three in it again. But Magherafelt’s game was a more polished version of their  version. Shane Heavron’s pass put Emmett McGuckin in and when he slotted between the posts there were four points between the sides yet again, with  minutes gone. McCluskey’s pressure couldn’t prevent Jack Doherty from squeezing over the bar, however, Glen were going to need a goal. But it was Magherafelt that carved open the chance. Lynch’s kick-out was perfectly flighted. Jared Monaghan was involved, Darren O’Neill and Paddy McLarnon ferried the ball forward before Conor Kearns was cut down by Ciaran McFaul and a penalty was awarded. After a delay, Shane Heavron took the kick but Mullan-Young got down to save. The Glen ‘keeper reacted by pushing Heavron to pick up a booking but later intercepted when the Magherafelt wing back had a half-chance on goal. At the other end, Odhraacuten Lynch was flawless under the dropping ball. Tallon, Alex Doherty and Emmett Bradley floated points over in the closing stages as Magherafelt began to retreat. A replay was looking a distinct possibility with Glen’s waves of late attacks but they will carry the controversial conclusion into the winter months. What    But finals are all about the winners and Magherafelt’s greater control took John McLaughlin to join the reserve, U and U titles already at Rossa Park and an U final to look forward to on Wednesday.

MAN OF THE MATCH: Odhraacuten Lynch – Danny Tallon and Alex Doherty were the shining lights for Glen, with Emmett McGuckin among many Magherafelt contenders. However, in the pressure cooker environment, Odhraacuten Lynch’s kicking was fantastic throughout, he got his angles perfect to deny Ethan Doherty and was ice cool under the dropping ball. TURNING POINT: Lynch save – Glen had just edged into a - to - lead after  minutes when Ethan Doherty had his goal-bound shot saved by Odhraacuten Lynch. Emmett McGuckin replied with a peach of a score and in the  minutes that followed the Rossa press shut down Glen’s kick-outs, helping them to a four point interval lead. SCORE OF THE GAME: Emmett McGuckin – Within seconds of Lynch’s save, Rossa went on their trademark swt counter-attack and after a deft dummy, McGuckin fired over the bar to level the sides. It was the start of Magherafelt’s period of control and they never looked back.

The Go For It Programme is part funded by Invest Northern Ireland and the European Regional Development Fund under the Investment for Growth and Jobs Northern Irelandprogramme.Andrew Rough, originally from Yorkshire but now settled in Derry, has turned his passion for quality beer into a career after he discovered a gap in the market for locally produced, quality craft beers. Originally from Yorkshire, Andrew moved to Derry where he met his we and settled down. He soon discovered that the beer offering was limited compared with what he has been accustomed to in Yorkshire. Andrew said, “As a Yorkshire man, I am used to a really wide selection of beers, ales and stouts. But when I moved to Northern Ireland, the selection was limited to what I had been accustomed. I really struggled to find something dferent to the common mass-produced brands. “Over time, a few micro- breweries started to pop-up and that’s where the idea really started. I worked in the Walled City Brewery when it first opened. I loved seeing the process from grain to glass and I enjoyed seeing the look on people’s faces when they tasted something a little dferent to the usual offerings. Rough Brothers Brewing boasts an offering of five distinct products using only the finest, locally sourced grain in its brewing process. This includes an Oatmeal Stout, Northern Pale Ale and a bespoke beer, brewed exclusively for a local Asian street food inspired restaurant. Following the decision to open his own micro- brewery, Andrew knew what his business would offer, but lacked the business knowledge needed to put the idea into motion. googletag.cmd.push  Andrew Rought, from Rough Brothers Brewing, with Claire Costello, business adviser with Enterprise North West for Derry City and Strabane District Council.   That’s when he contacted the Go For It Programme to seek the professional support he needed to develop a detailed business plan to assist with turning his business idea into a reality. “I got to a stage when I knew that I wanted to go out on my own and put my twist on the newly revived micro-brewing industry, which was starting to really come into its own. I had an idea of what I wanted my business to look like and the types of products I would produce, but when it came to putting it together into a business, that’s where I needed help and contacted the Go For It Programme.”“I filled in the Go For It Programme online enquiry form and got speaking to my business advisor at Enterprise North West the next day. It was really quick and easy.“I knew what I wanted the business to look like, but I needed advice when it came to the legalities surrounding alcohol production, health and safety and insurance. The advice and support I received was fantastic. Everything was really clear and really helped me to take the next steps to realising my business dreams. “We developed a clear strategy for growth, which included opportunities I hadn’t even considered like the bespoke brewing offering which now makes up almost half of my business. The process of writing the business plan was fantastic. It really helped to cement the business idea and outlined clear goals, financial and otherwise, for the future.”The Go For It programme is delivered free of charge by a team of experienced business mentors through Northern Ireland’s wide network of enterprise agencies. It provides expert advice and help with developing a robust business plan to help turn ideas into a commercial enterprise. Claire Costello, business adviser, Enterprise North West for Derry City and Strabane District Council, said: “Supporting Andrew during the start-up stage of his business was a pleasure. He had a really vibrant and exciting business idea, which we helped him to fine-tune into a viable business opportunity.”“We assisted Andrew in the development of his business plan, which identied key milestones in his business le-cycle and potential future opportunities which could assist with the continued growth of his business. “Also included in the business plan was a full financial forecast, which allowed us to determine critical elements including unit selling price, the break-even point and investment requirements.“Andrew hit the market at a really good time, craft beer is having a real moment at present, with no signs of slowing down anytime soon. It is fantastic to see Andrew doing so well, with new stockists announced regularly. We look forward to seeing what the future holds for Andrew and Rough Brothers Brewing.”If you have a business idea you’d like to develop oryou are thinking about starting a business contact the Go For It Programme on    or visit: www.goforitni.

There is something haunting about the idea of a lost love a relationship that never quite ran its natural course and could be reignited someday. Perhaps it’s not surprising that one in five people long to get back with an old flame, and now a new television show from ITV is searching for pining lovers in the Derry area. The team who make ‘Long Lost Family’ have been reuniting people with missing family members for a decade now they want to bring romantic soulmates together after years apart. googletag.cmd.push They have approached Derry Now for help, believing that the recent history of Northern Ireland may have indirectly resulted in a few star-crossed lovers. The turbulence of The Troubles and waves of migration to and from Northern Island in the latter part of the th century mean many couples may have been separated by circumstances. If this sounds like you, they want to hear your story. The programme idea was inspired by the story of KT Robbins, an American serviceman who fell in love with an eighteen-year-old French girl, Jeannine Ganaye in  and recently reunited with her after  years apart. The Derry area has provided similarly heart-warming stories in the past. Avril Trenklet and Bob Fanuce proved that true love never dies when they wed nearly  years after first meeting. Local factory girl, Avril first met US Marine Bob in  when he was stationed at a Naval base in Derry. After a whirlwind romance the couple got engaged but Bob got cold feet and called it off. As the years passed and they got on with their lives, both marrying other people and having families, but Avril says she always knew in her heart that one day they would be together again. One day out of the blue Avril, who was now widowed, got an email from Bob, sparking their reunion and shortly afterwards a second proposal. This time the wedding went ahead and the pair finally got their happy ending. The Long Lost Family team are looking for more lost loves like Bob and Avril. They only intend to reunite people who are currently single and happy to meet as friends … who knows, the spark might still be there. So,you want to reconnect with someone special from your past call    or email longlostloves@walltowall. .

There is something haunting about the idea of a lost love a relationship that never quite ran its natural course and could be reignited someday. Perhaps it’s not surprising that one in five people long to get back with an old flame, and now a new television show from ITV is searching for pining lovers in the Derry area. The team who make ‘Long Lost Family’ have been reuniting people with missing family members for a decade now they want to bring romantic soulmates together after years apart. googletag.cmd.push They have approached Derry Now for help, believing that the recent history of Northern Ireland may have indirectly resulted in a few star-crossed lovers. The turbulence of The Troubles and waves of migration to and from Northern Island in the latter part of the th century mean many couples may have been separated by circumstances. If this sounds like you, they want to hear your story. The programme idea was inspired by the story of KT Robbins, an American serviceman who fell in love with an eighteen-year-old French girl, Jeannine Ganaye in  and recently reunited with her after  years apart. The Derry area has provided similarly heart-warming stories in the past. Avril Trenklet and Bob Fanuce proved that true love never dies when they wed nearly  years after first meeting. Local factory girl, Avril first met US Marine Bob in  when he was stationed at a Naval base in Derry. After a whirlwind romance the couple got engaged but Bob got cold feet and called it off. As the years passed and they got on with their lives, both marrying other people and having families, but Avril says she always knew in her heart that one day they would be together again. One day out of the blue Avril, who was now widowed, got an email from Bob, sparking their reunion and shortly afterwards a second proposal. This time the wedding went ahead and the pair finally got their happy ending. The Long Lost Family team are looking for more lost loves like Bob and Avril. They only intend to reunite people who are currently single and happy to meet as friends … who knows, the spark might still be there. So,you want to reconnect with someone special from your past call    or email longlostloves@walltowall. .

However, Bryansfordrsquos sharpshooter Danny Savage, who was to score a spectacular - for his side, levelled the scoring.The RGU then played some scintillating football to take a - to - lead with points from Gerdy Collins , Connor McCarron and Johnnie Bell, who was having a superb game at midfield.Damian Turley, Collins and Tom Smyth were dominating the game and it was dficult to see how Bryansford were going to compete with them.But Savage, a former Down player, kept the lsquoFord in touch with four unanswered points to bring his side within one of the visitors.Another former county player, Packie Downey, was coming more into the game and he levelled the scores with a stunning point from play.Downpatrickrsquos Conor McGrady, another to wear the famous red and black colours, was brought into the game when defender Damian Branf was black carded, putting the RGU in front with a point.Smyth put the Hoops two in front, but the RGU were left stunned when Chris Clarke ended the half with an explosive shot that beat Deeny in the RGU goal to give Bryansford the half-time lead.If the RGU was stunned going into the break, after dominating for long periods in the first half, then after the opening  minutes of the second period, the thought of relegation to Division  was beginning to look a real possibility.Savage scored with with two frees, a  and a rsquo, but then the lsquoFord sharpshooter, with a real opportunist goal, put his side unbelievably six in front.Tim Prenter was then introduced into the game in place of McCarron and with the RGU management urging their players on, they duly responded with points from Branaganand a brace from Conor Doherty to put only one in the game.Conail McNabb was brought on in place of Ruari Quinn and unfortunately only lasted five minutes with a hamstring injury to be replaced by Tommy Loudon.However, with time ticking away, Savage again was the thorn in the RGU side with a  yard free to extend the lead to two.Damian Turley, with a breathtaking score, put the Hoops tantalising only one behind, but Davy McKibben, with a  yard free, put the lsquoFord two ahead again.Try as they could, the Hoops could not mount one last challenge and they were doomed to Division  for next year.Bryansford: M Reid, J Harbinson, S Toner, A Ward, D McDonald, T McAreavey, N OrsquoHiggins, P Downey , D McKibben , C Maginn, K Kavanagh, T Hanna, R OrsquoHiggins, C Clark , D Savage .Downpatrick: J Deeny, P Smyth, D Branf, E Rooney, R Murphy, S Bell , T Smyth , J Bell , D Turley , C McCarron , G Collins , C Doherty , J Branagan , P Turley, R Quinn.

She insists that she intends to deliver the authentic voice of moderate, progressive Irish nationalism in a place where it needs to be heard.And she has vowed to be a hard working Peer, lobbying and building alliances with other peers and parties across the chamber that will bring benefit to people in Northern Ireland.And while the former MP regrets no longer being a member of the SDLP, she said her political views have not altered and will reflect the partyrsquos central social democratic messages focused on the needs of people and the principles of equality, fairness and social justice for all in the House of Lords.With her new title now confirmed, Baroness Ritchie described Downpatrick as a ldquohistoric place on the island of Ireland, where St Patrick began and ended his ministry.ldquoThe town is a place of immense heritage and has a longstanding history. It is uniquely associated on the island with the patron saint and is also associated with the Normans and the Vikings, she continued.ldquoDownpatrick is also place of inclusion and a shared society. The area was one of the first to share power at local government level and in the days of the old Urban Council, it had responsibility for allocating housing and did so very much on the basis of need.The Baroness said the Downpatrick area was very much at the vanguard of political inclusion in terms of ensuring that people belonged, explaining that she plans to use her new title to promote the town.Her House of Lords induction takes place on November  with her formal introduction taking place the following day when she will be introduced by her two sponsors on the floor of the chamber.Baroness Ritchiersquos sponsors will be former Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Lord Paul Murphy and Baroness Angela Smith, who is the shadow leader of the Lords.She is also former NIO minister who was responsible for the the health, economy and environment portfolios during her time at Stormont.Lord Murphy was also Minister of State and led the British Government in the talks process that led to the Good Friday Agreement.Baroness Ritchie continued: ldquoI have picked my two sponsors on the basis that while I am going into the House of Lords as non-aligned and independent, my two sponsors understand the mechanics of the Good Friday Agreement and understand inclusion and power-sharing.ldquoMy maiden speech will hopefully take place sometime before the end of the year, although that could be subject to changea general election is called.Looking to the future, the Baroness said she has been using the past few weeks to get briefed on key issues which are important to her, including Brexit and its impact on the agri-food economy and local economy.ldquoTo me, there is no such thing as a good Brexit. The best deal for me is one where we will remain in the EU. What we have been presented with is one that is a bita curatersquos egg in many ways. There will ne no hard border which means no economic border and no veto in terms of the Assembly. Having said that, I am going to have to examine the Brexit deal in greater depth, she continued.ldquoThere are other issues that I want to focus on including the contaminated bloods issue, tourism VAT and what can be done to help our economy and ensure that we can grow and develop. The vaginal mess issue is something I have been associated with as is the importance of the Co Down fishing industry.Baroness Ritchie said while she does not have constituents, she will be speaking in a general Northern Ireland-wide context.ldquoI will be highlighting the importance of reflecting our political ersity and respect for political dference, ensuring that our institutions are up and running and that they respect the relationships between Ireland and Britain and Northern Ireland and the South.

The three of them were regularly checking the weather in the last few weeks leading up to race day as the temperatures were well up in the high s.Far too hot to be running a marathon, but thankfully in the final week it took a dramaticdown to nine degrees. Flying over on Friday with no time to waste, it was straight to the hotel and then immediately to the Expo to pick up their race numbers and buy some of the many race souvenirs that were on sale.In the Expo there was a wall of fame for all the runners who had completed the six majors. Murlough ACrsquos very own Paula McKibbin and Ann McAlarneyrsquos names were spotted on the wall for all to see.There was no time to get over the six-hours jet lag as they were all up at five in the morning and headed downtown to the start of the km friendship run.This was a bit of fun and involved a quick lap of the city centre finishing in Grant park. The rest of the day was spent in true MAC style with a boat cruise along the Chicago river before dinner in an Italian restaurant.The evening got better as needing a taxi for six people to take them back to the hotel, they managed to acquire the use of a party limousine at a very good rate.Another early start on Sunday as the marathon began at .am in the neighbouring Grant Park. Thankfully, it was only a  minute walk from the hotel. Theyrsquod only just made it into the corrals and the race started.A field of , runners, heading off north through the city, with defending champion Mo Farah expected to retain his title.As the route wound through the city it passed through many dferent districts, all with a party atmosphere and lined with people cheering and screaming encouragement.The noise during a major marathon in the USA is beyond belief, the bands playing, spectators lsquohigh fivingrsquo and the streets lined with people three or four thick is an experience like no other. We passed through the Mexican Quarter with bands playing and guys dancing, wearing sombreros and then on to Chinatownrsquo with the streets lined with drummers.It was then onto the Gay Quarter with drag queens performing on stage. It was a celebration for both runners and spectators.As with all marathons, the last five miles were a real test of mental determination as fatigue kicked in and Carol, unfortunately, was suffering from a knee injury that she picked up during training which ed at mile .They all pushed on with Hugh crossing the line first and recording a new personal best by one and a half minutes. Orla was next home followed by Charisse who recorded a huge personal best of  minutes.Carol was next home and managed to finish in a respectable time as she battled through the final  miles with knee problems. As the runners walked down the street after finishing they were greeted by four lines of local school kids applauding and congratulating all the runners. After the kids there were long tables either side of the street where one of the local sponsors, which happened to be a brewery, handing out free beer. Then onto the next table where they were given food and water.It makes you wonder what is not to like about this marathon  In the ladiesrsquo race a new world record was set as Brigid Kosgei beat Paula Radclfersquos record of  years. Ironically, as Carol finished her race and walked down to collect her medal she was presented with it from no other than Paula herself.It was back to the hotel to get ready for dinner that evening. As Hugh and Charisse walked back they talked about getting a pint of milk each for recovery.As the shop was a ten-minute walk away, Charisse said that even though she knew it would be a bit more expensive she was happy to buy milk for them both in the hotel bar.Being content with the two half pints that the bar served it was only when the bill was produced that they both discovered that they must have drunk the most expensive two glasses of milk ever, with a bill of  dollars. Anything to save tired feet.That evening they continued in MAC style, celebrating with a meal on Cindyrsquos roof top restaurant followed by a few beers in Buddy Guyrsquos Blues bar where we were treated in style with a table in the VIP area.

This was Kieranrsquos first big run in over three months due to injuries, so took him a lot longer to finish, but he says it just meant he had more time to take in the lovely views of Melbourne.It was an amazing race from start to finish taking in all the iconic places around Melbourne such as St Paulrsquos Cathedral, Flinders Street, Botanic Gardens and the Shrine of Remembrance.Followed by a lap around the GP circuit then up and down St Kildarsquos beach along the promenade.

The tourism and hospitality industry here supports , jobs ndash one of the biggest employment sectors in the county.ldquoIf Brexit happens it could mean some businesses may need to let some staff go and leave people without a job, said Rebekah.Stating that in her opinion Brexit offers the tourism and hospitality sector many innovative opportunities to potentially grow and expand, Rebekah shared some examples.ldquoThere has been a rise in lsquostaycationrsquo ndash the number of UK residents that have been staying and holidaying at homehas shown a three per cent rise in  and is continuing to grow something which would be good for Fermanagh Tourism, explained Rebekah, who also highlighted how Fermanagh is renowned for its celebrity chefs, award-winning restaurants and local produce which will continue to attract visitors to the County.Presenting facts on Business and Cross Border Trade, Nicole McFarlane and Oran OrsquoLoughlin shared how Enniskillen has the lsquotop performing ASDA store in the UKrsquo which was the th best store in Walmart Worldwide Group in  and that an average shopping trip spend by Republic of Ireland shoppers to Enniskillen is euro to euro.ldquoCross Border trade stands at pound. billion for  and Northern Ireland makes up between  to  per cent of total exports from Ireland to the UK and accounts for seven to eight per cent of imports, stated Nicole and Oran, adding that the flow of trade between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland will depend on what kind of agreement replaces the current one which is free market trade within the EU. Sharing a positive outlook on how Brexit could impact business trade, the studentsrsquo stated: ldquoBrexit could actually result in more opportunities in more vibrant markets across the world becoming available. Some argue that Brexit could liberate the UK government to sign fresh trade deals with more dynamic markets outside the EU and therefore bolster trade.Whilst presenting his research on how Brexit could impact Student Le, Jordan McClure shared: ldquoStudent le is a vital part of growing up where we learn many things. Brexit has taught me the importance of ensuring that my opinion and voice is heard, especially, when I wasnrsquot the age to vote in the  referendum.ldquoWhilst much of what happens around Brexit is beyond our control one thing for sure is that the potential impact will affect all of our lives. Whatever that may be, it is important that we as students embrace it and make the most of it, he added.Will Greenaway closed the conference by reiterating the potential benefits that could come from Brexit and potential concerns that leaving the EU could have on us in Northern Ireland and especially in Fermanagh.ldquoOur generation of students represent the future of Northern Ireland we are potentially the next generation of business leaders, health care workers and entrepreneurs.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A former head of two other schools in Gwent, he is clearly proud of his school and all they have accomplished.ldquoItrsquos a wonderful school and everyone here has worked so hard to make it that way, he said. ldquoBut it does face challenges.Like other head teachers in Penarth, Mr Rees had signed the open letter to the Welsh Government calling for fairer funding for Vale schools earlier this year. He had discussed coming in to the school on weekends to clean the toilets himself to help balance budgets. But he is firmly optimistic.ldquoBetween kind donations and fundraising efforts from our PTA, renting out the school hall, and younger members of staff taking on some extra burdens we are just about able to balance our budgets, he said. ldquoTo be honest, next year might start looking grim, but wersquore keeping our heads high.ldquoWith that said, wersquove been working hard on incorporating new initiatives and the new curriculum, we have a great crop of pupils and staff morale is high. We are very positive here.ldquoItrsquos also our th anniversary this year, so we have loads of ex-staff and pupils coming through the doors to say hello, a celebratory PTA barbecue and more planned.Taking a tour around the school, this positivity is reflected in students and staff alike. Children seem genuinely excited to learn, smiling, waving and saying hello to Mr Rees.Evenlode Primary School itself has an interesting history.It was opened in  as the first open plan primary school in South East Wales.The population of the school has risen dramatically over the last  years, from  on roll in  to the present .The building itself, a maze of classrooms and corridors plastered in colours, has also changed to accommodate more pupils.Much of the semi-open plan design has disappeared, making way for more conventional classrooms.The school benefits from having a superb site with two playgrounds as well as a large playing field, a designated play area for Reception children, a wildle area, open access to the local tennis club facilities, a newly constructed lsquooutside classroomrsquo and adventure trail.One of the first stops was a hall used by its lsquoSaplingsrsquo Out of School Care, the pre and after-school club for children.Saplings provides childcare for around  children from all year groups, providing breakfast in the morning and looking after children from .am to pm when needed.There, the children can access a wide range of activities, switched up on a regular basis.These have included cooking, gardening, art, crafts, sporting activities, outdoor play and plenty more.A couple of pupils, part of the Saplings, are called through. They happily talk about their favourite part of the clubs. One says arts and crafts another, going outside and playing sport four more say the food.Saplings isnrsquot the only place the students can indulge in a little food.Pupils have set up a fruit tuck shop in the school yard, a group endeavour that students control all aspects of - from placing orders for snacks, selecting the products, handling finances and, of course, selling to their friends.A small group of budding merchants were excited to show me their wares, selling oranges and bananas at break time.There was plenty more to do outside, as well.Mr Rees himself taught fire-making lessons in their fire pit, while the school also made use of rope courses, and a newly refurbished gazebo.Bike racks could be found at the front and back of the site, with students encouraged to cycle to school.Sport is very high on the schoolrsquos agenda.ldquoWe have kids from the school representing us in cricket, rugby and tennis at a county level, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore also fielding regular football, rugby and netball teams, and we are pushing plenty of other outdoor activities - like our new ropes and outdoor assault course.ldquoWersquore lucky to have parents in this area who are incredibly supportive of sports, and we have some shining examples of sporting prowess in our children.ldquoWe think itrsquos a very important part of being a rounded and healthy inidual.The school doesnrsquot just focus on sport - they aim to nurture minds and souls too.ldquoExpressive arts is a major area of focus at the moment, said Mr Rees. ldquoWersquore lucky enough to have a drama specialist supporting us, helping coach the children through both acting and production.ldquoWe are even working with the Welsh Government on a production of H.G. Wellrsquos The Time Machine, to be held in our school hall.The hall had been built with money raised from selling off surplus land, with a further loan from the Vale council.It is tidy, modern, and neatly decorated, with a sophisticated looking lighting system - built with help from parents.ldquoWersquore very proud of the relationship we have with parents here, said Mr Rees. ldquoThey have been enormously helpful with our budgetary concerns.Evenlode is a school with a cheerful outlook, a happy student body and a strong working relationship between staff, students and parent alike.It deserves to go far. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His father was West African and his mother was Irish.Billy was overlooked by rugby union. However he is recognised as one of the greatest ever British rugby league players.Elizabeth lsquoBettyrsquo Campbell, also born in  in Butetown, was the first black head teacher in Wales.Following a public vote on hidden heroines Cardf Council confirmed earlier this year that a statue of Betty will be built in Cardf - the first woman to feature in our capital city.On the weekend I will be on a question and answer  about institutionalised racism in Wales, across sport, the media, politics, and the world of work.I look forward to sitting on the  with Cllr Saeed Ebrahim, lawyer Hilary Brown, and Chisomo Phiri from EYST.As more and more Black History Month events take place across Wales, I cannot help but feel a sense of pride in how far we have come as a nation.I hope that these events continue to inspire the next generation of young black leaders as we still have so much more to change.To all my constituents, to everyone across Wales, I hope you all join in with the celebrations and festivities of this historic month, attend the events, learn about those that have trailblazed for us and make this a Black History Month to remember. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It would require the removal of seven of the  ancient trees in the Conservation Area.Many of the trees had been assessed in September  as deserving of a Tree Protection Order, which would prevent them from being cut down, though the Vale council has said they are in the process of securing the protection orders.Residents say one ndash Ash Tree , crucial to development ndash has already been removed. John Lean, a resident of Kymin Terrace, said: ldquoAround a week ago, the first ash tree was sawn down. It was painted as a routine tidying up of their grounds, that it was sick, and was carried out not by the architects who made the main application, but by the warden. We do not believe there was anything wrong with that tree.ldquoAn application was made under Section  of the Planning Acts for the removal of Ash Tree , another tree not in the wood but next to the house, and the removal of a fallen tree. No notice was given to local residents the Vale council did not inspect the site before permission was given, and the first we knew of it was when we heard the chainsaws.Ash Tree  would have to be removed for any development to take place, to allow construction traffic to pass.David Burnett, a resident, said: ldquoThis creates a dangerous precedent for further development here.ldquoWhen the construction of Homeside House was permitted on appeal in , the inspector at the time made it clear that it should not impinge on the woodland. The woodland was described as lsquoinviolatersquo ndash itrsquos at least  years old. What was true then is true now. Other residents had further complaints about the proposed development, and the methodology used to carry out inspections.The large footprint of the dwelling occupies over half the site. The access road would also have to be able to take construction traffic, which residents fear would further damage the site and could limit parking.One resident described a bat survey as lsquocompletely inadequatersquo, as the resident said the survey carried out on behalf of the applicant noted observation was made on two occasions only.William and Karen Stonehouse said: ldquoThe development would involve the destruction of a valuable natural habitat without any benefit to the community whatsoever.ldquoPenarth is not short of expensive properties. It is affordable housing that is desperately needed to prevent the continuing drain of its young people who can no longer afford to buy any property here.ldquoThis proposal does nothing to address that.Joanna Masters said: ldquoI am very concerned about the proposed plan to fell the wood.ldquoI thought the world was becoming more environmentally aware, particularly regarding the value of trees, but it seems the Vale council is, in its own way, as irresponsible as Brazilrsquos Bolsonaro.A spokesman for the Vale council said: ldquoThis planning application has yet to be determined and will be considered in exactly the same way as any other, with the views of all interested parties taken into account.ldquoThat will involve reviewing all letters of representation and consultation responses on the matter. IldquoIt has been resubmitted after a previous one for a similar development was withdrawn as it failed to provide full details of the impact on nearby trees.ldquoWe are in the process of arranging Tree Preservation Orders for trees there that meet the criteria for that protection.ldquoThe council did approve an application to fell an ash tree from Homeside House as, after inspection by an officer, it was deemed to have a fungal bracket, which can structurally weaken trees to the point of breakage. That being the case, it was decided a TPO was not appropriate.The freehold for the woodland was purchased by Proxima GR Properties in  from McCarthy  Stone, who had built an unsheltered accommodation around the site.The Penarth Times has attempted to reach Proxima GR Properties for a comment. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There is fierce competition to host the All Ireland Fleadh each year as it attracts thousands of visitors and musiciaans from across the world. Councillor Mark BaxterAt Monday night’s meeting Sinn Fein welcomed the success of their motion, tabled by the party’s group leader Darren McNally, which asked council to investigate the feasibility and economic benefits of hosting the Fleadh Cheoil Na hEireann in Armagh.Cllr McNally said it would be ‘a massive economic boost for the entire borough’ with a potential £m for the economy.“I believe Armagh would be a very fitting venue given the rich ancient heritage and culture the city possesses’”#However DUP Cllr Mark Baxter said: ““We are hugely disappointed that we were the only party to vote against this potential colossal spend by council in these very tough economic times. The other parties were quite happy to task officers to investigate bringing the Fleadh Cheoil to Armagh despite the huge cost involved.” “Ironically it was only three weeks ago that Sinn Fein refused to back another much smaller proposal for a community event citing a lack of council resources. I would question in the strongest possible terms the economic benefits and the motives for bringing such an event and why the UUP and Sinn Fein are so keen to bring the event to Armagh which has in the past had some very controversial artists. Indeed we all can point to similar festivals recently held in Belfast where its very clear that ‘unionists’ were not welcome with Pro-IRA chanting and bands imploring the British to “go back home. “I would call on councillors to reflect on this wanton disregard for the public purse and remind them of their responsibilities in delivering first class services for best value. The DUP make no apology for being the champions of low rates in council.”Sinn Fein Cllr Liam Mackle dismissed claims by the DUP‘s Mark Baxter that the motion committed council to a massive spend as untrue.He said: “The passing of this motion gives council officers the freedom to engage with numerous stakeholders holders including Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann who organise the Fleadh Cheoil to get a better understanding of what’s expected of any host venue, Council officers will bring back a report to committee following engagements with local businesses, hospitality sector, community groups and traditional musicians, where Councillors can have an informed debate on its feasibility.“We have seen the DUP on ABC council spend hundreds of thousands of pounds on a whim - on events with no economic benefit to our borough. Their behaviour is somewhat childish, compared to the mature approach of this motion.”Musician Willie calls for better rehabilitation for stroke survivors Coremetrics  Coremetrics

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.  Danske Bank’s Conor Lambe said there were still a number of possibilities for what might happen over the next  days, with the UK due to leave the EU on October . Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election. But predictions were \"incredibly dficult\", he said. \"Businesses should behave prudently and use this time to ensure they are as prepared as they can be for a worst-case scenario, no-deal Brexit, in case it occurs at the end of this month,\" he said. The .% is down from the bank’s previous forecasts, delivered in June, that growth would hit % in  and .% in .

Ulster Business speaks to Northern Ireland managing director Ian Sheppard, and learns more about how colleagues are being empowered to play an active role in the local communities where they live and work Bank of Ireland UK sees developing its colleagues and helping customers and communities to thrive as part of its DNA, according to Ian Sheppard, managing director in Northern Ireland.From key charity partnerships, to fundraising, volunteering, sponsorship and more, Ian says the desire for Bank of Ireland UK is to make a positive impact by empowering colleagues to make a dference.“When I speak to my colleagues, I hear how really active and involved they are in their own community,” Ian says. “There are so many examples and I never cease to be amazed by their passion and commitment.An important partnership for the bank is with Alzheimer’s Society, its flagship charity for the last two years. In that time around £, has been raised in Northern Ireland, but as Ian explains it’s about more than fundraising.“We realised that not only can we help them financially, but there are resources we can share and opportunities we can offer which can help to signicantly raise the charity’s profile and raise much needed funds.”One example in which the bank has supported Alzheimer’s Society in this way is through its own long-running partnership with Ulster Rugby.“We donated our advertising and promotion activity for a televised game at the Kingspan Stadium making the charity ‘Sponsor for a Day’. This included using their logo on the back of the Ulster Rugby jerseys, taking over the pitch side boards and inviting a group of people living with dementia, their family and carers to the game – helping to get their brand message out to not only a stadium with capacity of , people but to a much wider TV audience.”Alzheimer’s Society sees some fantastic people giving their time to help others. That’s no clearer than its Side by Side programme, which Bank of Ireland UK helps to fund.The photograph on the front of this edition of the magazine taken at the Grand Opera House in Belfast features Mary Dalzell a Side by Side volunteer, alongside Hazel Whiteside, who has been living with dementia for two years.They share a love of music, theatre and cinema and the Side by Side programme, which re-connects people with dementia to their communities by doing the things they love, has not only put a smile on both their faces but has had a positive impact on their lives.There are so many people impacted by dementia and Alzheimers in our local communities, and its touching so many people’s lives, taking this as our motivation, the bank now has almost , staff trained as Dementia Friends.The bank’s ‘Give Together’ programme means staff can take one day a year to spend the time working with a charity or community organisation of their choice. “This day can involve anything from gardening work to painting a youth centre,” Ian says“Beyond Alzheimer’s Society, colleagues are helping many other organisations such as Macmillan Cancer Support, Cancer Research UK through its Relay for Le Legenderry, the Wooden Spoon children’s rugby charity, and Space NI, which offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community.” You canabout some of the good work colleagues have done further on in this feature.“We are also committed to reflecting the community by developing a erse and modern workforce – which is part-and-parcel of a progressive company,” Ian says. “It’s something that current and future employees expect in their employer. For us its part of our DNA, something that’s always been there but we are now putting a clear and visible structure around it,” Ian says.This has included being a founding member of FuSIoN – the Financial Services Inclusion Network which drives to support and promote LGBT+ professionals across the sector, becoming JAM Card members – allowing staff to knowcustomers with a communication barrier need ‘just a minute’, as well as recently being awarded the Diversity Charter Mark.“Our community involvement is something we are very clear about - something I’m passionate about and it’s an easy ask to get staff engaged. It’s very natural, and it has always been developed from the ground up,” Ian says.He believes this contributes to the huge numbers of staff doing their bit – enabling their own local communities to thrive.  ALISON MITCHELLA customer service manager for Bank of Ireland UK in Londonderry, Alison has worked for the bank for  years, but her motivation for fundraising and support for Alzheimer’s Society began in , following her mother-in-law’s diagnosis with dementia. Alison trained at her local hospital to become a dementia volunteer and learned so much she asked Alzheimer’s Society to run similar sessions in her own branch to enable staff to better assist customers with dementia.Sadly, Alison’s mother-in-law passed away in May of this year but to mark her passing and to raise vital funds in her memory, Alison took part in Alzheimer’s Society Cupcake Day. Initial plans to simply sell cupcakes within her own branch changed rapidly as colleagues from nearby branches heard of the event and wanted to support both Alison and the charity.  Faced with orders for more than  cupcakes, Alison requested a Give Together day, which is time given by the bank to both iniduals and teams to give back to their communities. Alison says: “I was in the kitchen from am to pm baking and icing but it was worth it. The event raised £, which Bank of Ireland UK matched doubling the amount raised to £,. “I could not have achieved that without the support of family, colleagues and the wider business. I was proud to raise the funds in my mother-in-law’s memory and I am proud to work for an organisation that not only values our role in the wider community but supports it too.” CHRISTINE GRAHAMChristine Graham has helped to raise funds for Cancer Research UK through the Relay for Le “Legenderry” event held in St. Columb’s Park, Londonderry.The Derry-based senior business manager for Bank of Ireland UK has personally been touched by cancer as she lost two close family members to the disease. Her young great niece was also diagnosed with a rare form of cancer in  and is now doing well, but seeing the impact a cancer diagnosis has on a family inspired Christine to get involved with the Relay for Le event.“Our event truly is ‘legenderry’,” she says. It is a -hour relay race that brings the whole community together to celebrate the lives of cancer survivors, to remember those lost to the disease, to fight back by increasing our knowledge of cancer and by raising money to fund le-saving cancer research.”In just three years the event has raised over £, for Cancer Research UK with Christine helping to raise £, in  – not only the most successful Relay for Le event in the UK this year but all funds raised in Northern Ireland stays here.  Christine values the support she has had from the bank who promote the event to the wider community and from her colleagues who enter teams.“Relay for Le is for all ages and stages, all shapes and sizes,” she says. It’s cross community and intergenerational and the atmosphere every year is electric.”Plans are already underway for Relay for Le  which promises to be another massive event. PAUL MAGEEPaul Magee, associate director of the corporate banking team, became involved with the Ulster Region Committee for Wooden Spoon, the Children’s Charity of Rugby, five years ago after he successfully completed the charity’s Four Peaks Challenge, reaching the summits of the UK and Ireland’s highest peaks. He is now an active committee member for Wooden Spoon, helping to raise funds to provide le-enhancing experiences for disadvantaged and disabled children. “All funds raised in Ulster stay in the region and benefit the children here,” Paul says. “For instance, we provided £, to the Mae Murray Foundation to buy specialist equipment for the first fully accessible beach in Ulster at Benone Strand. When we created the access to the beach, one parent was very emotional as he watched his teenage daughter in the sea for the first time. It’s those occasions where we’re responding to a need within the community that makes the effort worthwhile.”Wooden Spoon has funded numerous charity projects, most recently £, for a new multi-sensory room at Parkview Special School in Lisburn and purchasing a horse for Riding for the Disabled Association in Coleraine, a charity that enhances children’s lives every day.  With his passion for and involvement in Wooden Spoon, Paul is grateful for the support Bank of Ireland has given him in his role with the organisation, specically the corporate banking team who value his dedication to making a dference. He says: “The bank has been fantastic – I appreciate the flexibility the team offers in the lead up to events and my colleagues often attend Wooden Spoon fundraisers. I’ve also benefited from the bank’s Give Together initiative, which offers days of paid leave that employees can use for volunteering. The bank’s support has helped facilitate my commitment to Wooden Spoon, where I can really see and be a part of the impact the charity has on the local community.” SALLY IRVINEOver the last  years Sally Irvine’s coffee mornings have become a highlight in the office calendar, in turn raising more than £, for MacMillan Cancer Support and funding  days of specialist nursing care for cancer patients across Northern Ireland.Sally, a business lending and credit governance manager at Bank of Ireland UK, arranged her first Macmillan Coffee Morning in  following a colleague’s cancer diagnosis. She found herself wanting to do something to help people living with cancer and so took the plunge and decided to be a host as part of Macmillan’s biggest coffee morning fundraising event. From the outset, Sally had tremendous support from her team members and the wider business, and this has contributed to the ongoing success of the event.The bank plays a huge part in ensuring Sally can deliver the event each year by giving her support through their Give Together scheme.Sally says: “The coffee morning has become a very special occasion and a great day of fun where people from across the bank come together to have a wee cuppa and a cake and take time to catch up while raising money for a really important cause. One in two of us will face cancer at some time in our lives and I am passionate about continuing to fundraise to provide the specialist nursing care that’s so vital for those living with cancer.”Plans are already underway for this year’s Macmillan Coffee Morning and Sally is hopeful the annual fundraiser will continue to hold a special place in the office calendar. PAUL SLEVINBranch manager at Bank of Ireland UK in Newry, Paul Slevin is someone who embodies the bank’s ethos of community involvement through his role with the charity Space NI.  Space NI offers support services in health and social care sectors to the local community. Through its service Home to Hospital, the organisation has helped  elderly people travel to crucial hospital appointments, while its Family Support Hub offers vital assistance to families in distress. Paul joined the charity in  and has just completed five years as chairman of the Board of Directors. He is proud that his background in finance has enabled him to support the charity through its repositioning process to ensure that its activities best serve the community.  Since Paul’s involvement with the charity began, Space NI has won the ‘One to Watch’ award at NI Social Enterprise Awards and the ‘Community Wellbeing Initiative’ at the All Ireland Pride of Place Awards. The organisation has also grown and opened a third premises in Newry and launched a range of volunteer made soy wax candles to raise crucial funds. “Bank of Ireland UK encourage all staff to give back,” Paul says. “Every manager I’ve had was very active in their community, so they were both great role models and great motivators. I think it’s really important to give our time, our expertise, and to do whatever we can to help and support the communities we live and work in.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/12312323.jpg","title":"novosco sold to global services giant for m","story":"Posted on Monday  October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland IT services firm Novosco has been bought by a German-based global industry giant for around £m, it has emerged.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We’ve got a great new deal that takes back control — now Parliament should get Brexit done on Saturday so we can move on to other priorities like the cost of living, the NHS, violent crime and our environment.\" Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, said: “This agreement is a fair compromise between the EU and the UK. It is testament to the commitment and willingness of both sides to do what is best for EU and UK citizens. We now have a newly agreed Protocol that protects peace and stability on the island of Ireland and fully protects our Single Market. I hope that we can now bring this over the line and provide the certainty our citizens and businesses so deserve.” Michel Barnier, the European Commissions chief negotiator, said: “We had dficult discussions over the past days. We have managed to find solutions that fully respect the integrity of the Single Market. We created a new and legally operative solution to avoid a hard border, and protect peace and stability on the island of Ireland. It is a solution that works for the EU, for the UK and for people and businesses in Northern Ireland.” The DUP has said it could not support the deal brokered by Mr Johnson. So, what deal was agreed  A statement from the European Commission says: “In terms of regulations, Northern Ireland will remain aligned to a limited set of rules related to the EUs Single Market in order to avoid a hard border: legislation on goods, sanitary rules for veterinary controls , rules on agricultural production marketing, VAT and excise in respect of goods, and state aid rules. “In terms of customs, the EU-UK Single Customs Territory, as agreed in November , has been removed from the Protocol on Ireland   Northern Ireland, at the request of the current UK government. EU and UK negotiators have now found a new way to achieve the goal of avoiding a customs border on the island of Ireland, while at the same time ensuring Northern Ireland remains part of the UKs customs territory. This agreement fully protects the integrity of the EUs Single Market and Customs Union, and avoids any regulatory and customs checks at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. “Finally, the EU and the UK have agreed to create a new mechanism on ‘consent, which will give the Members of the Northern Ireland Assembly a decisive voice on the long-term application of relevant EU law in Northern Ireland. The Commission has been in close contact with the Irish government on this point.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/redbus.jpg","title":"wrightbus deal struck to buy ballymena bus maker","story":"Posted on Tuesday  October  by John Mulgrew A deal has been struck to buy the business and assets of Ballymena bus maker Wrightbus after it entered administration with the loss of , jobs.

We hear about the firm’s plans for growth hereBelfast City is changing and its transportation network and parking strategy have a key role to play in supporting its growth. Innovative use of technology to make parking ‘smarter’ and promoting better use of city centre space will contribute to creating the right environment for business investment and the lestyle of residents, commuters and visitors. The need for effective parking planning reaches beyond Belfast city though as parking issues are common in towns across the country. Parking planning is not just about the provision and management of spaces – the majority of parking acts require some sort of enforcement system to ensure effectiveness. As an experienced parking operator, APCOA can work with the public and private sectors to contribute knowledge and expertise to the planning and implementation of effective parking strategies. An on-going investment in developing parking technology also offers new ways of improving services to clients and the public.In August, APCOA acquired the business of Nationwide Controlled Parking Systemsin Ireland, including subsidiaries Parking Enforcement Solutionsand Mobile Research Solutions.The combined operation resulting from the acquisition sees APCOA’s business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland double in size to cover more than , site locations and it will enable them to service all counties in both countries.APCOA’s existing business in Northern Ireland operated a number of sites including two city centre multi storey car parks in Belfast city centre. The NCPS subsidiary PEA brings a further c. locations, primarily in the greater Belfast area with key sites such as the Titanic Quarter, numerous NHS hospitals and trusts and the Odyssey.

We’re really excited about the opportunities ahead.”Neil Cunningham, managing director of APCOA in Ireland, explains why he sees the acquisition as a positive move for the business in Northern Ireland.“This investment strengthens APCOA’s ability to offer countrywide services and gives us a stronger base for future growth. Colleagues in both companies have a keen focus on customer service and we’ve brought together two experienced management teams.“I’m also delighted that Jason Ballard, founder and chief executive of NCPS and PEA, will continue to work with us for the next six months to support the smooth integration of the business. Combine those factors with the wide range of services and innovative technology we can offer, the possibilities for further growth in Northern Ireland look very strong indeed.”  Philippe Op de Beeck, chief executive of APCOA Parking Group, says the company “profited from healthy organic growth last year”. “In addition, we are currently strengthening our focus on strategic acquisitions.“The group recently acquired Onepark A S in Denmark, after having bought another smaller Swiss company early last year.
