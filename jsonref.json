Video: YouTube Sinn FéinSinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald told the ardfheis that ‘it is time for Irish unity’. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald claimed that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are “out of touch, out of ideas and out of time” as she made a pitch to be a taoiseach that “puts workers and families first”. Ms McDonald pledged that her party will “fix housing and healthcare” and build a fair and resilient economy in which business and workers rocked by coronavirus can recover. Her speech came at the end of the party Ardfheis in Dublin where Sinn Féin dropped its long-standing policy of outright opposition to the non-jury Special Criminal Court. The party’s stance on the court has been a key line of attack against Sinn Féin by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. The move accepting the need for non-jury courts in “exceptional circumstances” will be interpreted as part of Sinn Féin’s preparations for government in the South. Ms McDonald argued that “the writing is on the wall for Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael”, saying the two big parties have been in Government far too long. “Things were bad enough when these parties pretended to oppose each other. But by god things have gone to the dogs since the boys clubbed together,” she claimed. The Sinn Féin leader added, “let’s call time on their century-old stranglehold on power”, that as “friends, we can unite our country”. She addressed “everyone who feels that the Ireland of today doesn’t work for you but who believes that the Ireland of tomorrow can”. Ms McDonald said: “I know you have had it with governments giving tax breaks to millionaire executives while homeless children eat dinner off cardboard on the street. It’s time now for a government for you and your family that puts workers and families first. Sinn Féin will deliver that government for the people. We want to lead that government. And I want to lead as taoiseach if you give us that chance.” Ms McDonald promised that it would be a government that “will end the housing crisis, build an all-Ireland health service, tackle the cost of living crisis and guarantee your right to retire on a full state pension at the age of 65”. In a reference to the party’s failure to capitalise on its rise in support ahead of the last general election she said “to those who told me – again and again – to be sure we run enough candidates at the next Dáil election, I hear you loud and clear because . . . the time for change is now. Every big step change in Irish life has been made by ordinary people seizing the day.” Call for changeShe linked examples from “Easter Rising to Armagh Gaol and the H-Blocks of Long Kesh” to marriage equality and the repeal of the Eighth Amendment. She claimed Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar clubbed together to stop a government for change. “In truth, they can block change. They can delay change, but they cannot stop it. Neither can the DUP.” She said the unionist electoral majority in the North is gone and Sinn Féin are preparing for the next Assembly election. “If Sinn Féin emerges as the largest party, we will nominate Michelle O’Neill as first minister. The days of ‘Fenians need not apply’ are over.” She branded partition “a catastrophe” and said “this is the time to end partition, not to celebrate it”, an apparent reference to events to mark the centenary of Northern Ireland. “The Tory government now seeks amnesty for perpetrators of British state violence in Ireland. Shame on them. Boris Johnson, there is no support in Ireland or internationally for your amnesty.” said Ms McDonald. “It is time for Irish unity.” And she added that there is an onus on the Irish Government to prepare for referendums and reunification."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Kremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"britain and france in standoff over fishing boat checks and landings","story":"Fishing boats in Boulogne port: France has threatened to impose extra checks on British lorries in a standoff over fishing licences with crown dependencies Jersey and Guernsey. Photograph: Gareth FullerPA Britain has threatened to target all European Union fishing boats in its territorial waters for “rigorous checks” if France blocks British boats from landing catches at its ports. France has also threatened to impose extra checks on British lorries as part of a package of retaliatory measures in a standoff over fishing licences with crown dependencies Jersey and Guernsey. Britain summoned the French ambassador on Friday and Brexit minister David Frost raised the issue at a meeting with European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic in London.“Lord Frost also set out to the vice president our concerns about the unjustified measures announced by France earlier this week to disrupt UK fisheries and wider trade, to threaten energy supplies, and to block further co-operation between the UK and the EU, for example on the Horizon research programme,” a government spokesperson said.\u0026nbsp“Lord Frost made clear that, if these actions were implemented as planned on November 2nd, they would put the European Union in breach of the Trade and Co-operation Agreement (TCA).\u0026nbspThe government is accordingly considering the possibility, in those circumstances, of launching dispute settlement proceedings under the TCA, and of other practical responses, including implementing rigorous enforcement processes and checks on EU fishing activity in UK territorial waters, within the terms of the TCA.”Fishing rightsUnder the terms of the agreement, European fishing boats that can demonstrate that they have been fishing in British coastal waters before Brexit should be given licences to continue fishing there. But Jersey and Guernsey have refused 55 applications from French boats on the grounds that they have not provided sufficient evidence.The issue has come to a head now because temporary licences issued earlier this year expire this weekend and only boats that have been licensed or are still under consideration will be able to continue to fish near Jersey and Guernsey.Boris Johnson, who is due to meet Emmanuel Macron in Rome on Sunday morning during the G20 summit, said he did not believe the French president wanted to threaten Britain.“There may be people on both sides of the Channel who may think they have an interest in promoting disharmony between the UK and France, promoting the impression of disharmony between the UK and France. I don’t think Emmanuel shares that perspective personally at all,” he said.‘Appropriate action’“On the particular issues that we have, we are puzzled about what is going on. We fear that there may be a breach of the terms of the Trade and Co-operation Agreement implicit on what is happening and some of the things that are being said. We stand by to take the appropriate action.”Lord Frost’s meeting with Mr Sefcovic ended without a breakthrough on the Northern Ireland protocol but their negotiating teams will meet again in Brussels next week. Lord Frost acknowledged “some overlap\u0026nbspbetween our positions on a subset of the issues” but said substantial gaps remained.The EU has offered sweeping changes to the way the protocol is implemented, which would eliminate most checks on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland but will not entertain Lord Frost’s demand to remove the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in determining if single market rules are being applied properly.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"britain cannot give frances blackmail someone must uphold international","story":"You know what? Remainers were right. They always said that Brexit would lead to an upsurge in populism and demagoguery that would undermine international relations, and it has. But it has happened in France, not the UK.The fisheries row follows a familiar pattern, with French ministers blustering and threatening while their British counterparts urge both sides to follow the rules. We saw the same thing over Aukus, over illegal migration and over vaccines. In each case, France threw a tantrum while the UK tried to behave like an adult.Over the past week, British ministers have been appealing both to their French counterparts and to the EU (which controls France’s fisheries agreements) to stick to the deal that the two sides signed on 30 December, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA).French ministers, by contrast, have been threatening all manner of semi-legal and illegal measures, from a go-slow on checks at the Channel ports to a ban on British vessels landing their catches in France.France’s Europe minister, Clément Beaune, speaking as one might speak of Iran or North Korea, says that Britain understands “only force”.“Ce n’est pas la guerre, c’est un combat,” adds his colleague, the fisheries minister, Annick Girardin, as if making some sort of concession. But picking fights that stop short of outright war is hardly the act of a friend.Make no mistake, France is crossing the road to have a fight with us. When such rows blow up, it is tempting to think that there must be a dollop of blame on both sides. But not this time.Let’s recall the sequence of events. Under the Common Fisheries Policy, fish stocks were treated as a “common resource” to which every EU state had “equal access” according to a quota system worked out in Brussels. Jersey was not in the EU, but its foreign policy was run by the UK, and it was covered by a supplementary treaty, the Granville Bay Agreement.When Britain left the EU, it resumed control of its territorial waters, out to 200 miles or the median line, as laid down by marine law. In theory, it could have reserved an exclusive right to fish in those waters for its own boats, but almost no country does that.Britain secured a larger quota for its skippers – a phased increase of some 25 per cent – but also agreed to recognise the rights of vessels that had historically fished in its waters, some going back to pre-EEC days.Part of the treaty dealt with waters between six and 12 miles from the coast. Here, Britain and the EU agreed to grant access to boats which could demonstrate an existing presence.In practice, that part of the deal applied only one way, because almost no UK vessels fish on the other side of the Channel. None the less, Britain interpreted the rules generously, defining “presence” as having fished at least one day a year over four years.Both sides – Britain and the Channel Islands on the one hand and the EU and its coastal states on the other – understood what was being signed. The deal was intended to cap foreign access to British waters at its existing level, a common enough concept in fisheries agreements, resting on what is known as a “reference period”.The UK and the Channel Islands have been immensely accommodating within the terms of that deal, admitting any reasonable evidence of past access to their waters, even offering their own electronic records, and granting interim licences to skippers who struggled to complete the paperwork in time.Jersey has licensed more than 160 EU vessels, almost all of them French. But a further 50 or so have not been able to provide any evidence of a presence in Jersey waters – almost certainly because they have not fished there. On any conceivable interpretation, the terms of the TCA exclude them.In this sense, France’s dispute is not so much with the UK as with the EU, which signed the treaty on its behalf – a point made acidly by Marine Le Pen. The EU has not disputed Britain’s contention that it is acting within the letter and spirit of the TCA.The question is whether, in the last resort, Brussels will uphold the law, or whether, like an unreformed trade union, it will take a “my member right or wrong” approach.You might think, given that it is currently suing Poland for an alleged refusal to uphold the EU legal order, that it would prioritise the rule of law. France, after all, is being quite open in its threat to flout international agreements.There are, for example, rules governing customs and borders procedures that allow for increased checks only as a proportionate response to an identified threat. The EU, as the signatory and guarantor of the TCA, has a responsibility to enforce it.But legality is usually trumped by what in Brussels is called “solidarity”. France’s prime minister has written to ask the European Commission for support, not on grounds that France is in the right, but because it must show that “leaving the Union is more damaging than remaining in it”.My guess is that the EU will be receptive to that argument. In the 21 years that I was an MEP, I witnessed dozens of spats between Greece and Turkey.Sometimes Greece had the better claim and sometimes Turkey had, but Eurocrats were never much interested in the rights and wrongs. It was Athens, not Ankara, that had the power to make their life awkward, so they invariably backed Greece, however petulant or unreasonable its position, to the point where Turkey lost interest in the Western alliance and turned its face eastwards.Is that our future? To be Turkey to France’s Greece? To be drawn into one needless spat after another until we abandon our strategic partnership with Europe? Or is there a chance that things will settle down after the French election?While we can’t say for sure, the omens are not encouraging. It is true that Macron can be more Anglophobic in his language than his Right-wing rivals. He knows that foreign quarrels play well at home. The issue itself is secondary – Astrazeneca, the Northern Ireland Protocol, an energy blockade, bah – what really matters is being seen to bash the old foe.Macron, who recently looked unelectable, is now leading the polls in any putative presidential run-off. Why should his tactics change if he wins?The most depressing aspect of the row – though, after five years of similar antics, hardly a surprising one – is the number of British commentators who have had their heads so turned by Brexit that they automatically back any EU state against their own.This requires some painful intellectual contortions. For example, the demand that Britain reward unprovoked blackmail is framed as a call for “maturity” or “de-escalation”. France’s blatant threats to act outside the law are excused on grounds that Britain has supposedly done the same thing over the Northern Ireland Protocol.(In fact, there is no comparison between a legal measure – Article 16 is expressly part of the Protocol, and the EU was quite ready to trigger it – and openly ignoring the rules but, even so, Britain has sought a negotiated settlement rather than invoking the clause.)As for the claim that all this is happening because of Brexit, it is true – but not in the way that Europhiles mean. French blockades were a frequent occurrence when we were in the EU. As an MEP representing Kent, I would regularly pursue compensation claims on behalf of hauliers and other afflicted businesses – usually, I am sorry to report, without success.But there is a sense in which this row was indeed prompted by Brexit. Britain has, as promised, taken back its territorial waters. The EU, rather than face a no-deal outcome that would have resulted in its total exclusion from those waters, signed a treaty in which it agreed to a phased reduction in its share. France does not like the consequences and so pretends to be shocked – shocked – by what the treaty means in practice.Britain cannot begin its relationship as an independent neighbour of the EU by giving in to patently illegal threats. Someone must stand up for a law-based international order.Boris Johnson should take inspiration from his predecessor Lord Palmerston, the priapic patriot who dominated our mid-nineteenth century foreign policy.

Staff in other government departments have then been trained to deliver them more widely to civil servants. John O’Connell, the chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, added: “Civil servants’ time should be focused on providing high-quality services, not wasted on woke causes.“There are extensive laws in place to prevent discrimination in the workplace so training programmes like this should not be required.“The upcoming spending review is the perfect time for ministers to cut back these sessions and eradicate this sort of wasteful spending for good.”Diagrams of allyship are also shown in the sessions along with handouts on contested concepts such as privilege, “authentic allyship” and the “white saviour complex”, described as when white staff try to help their minority ethnic colleagues to make themselves feel better. It comes after the Government scrapped unconscious bias training for civil servants in England, with ministers insisting there was no evidence that it helped change attitudes towards discrimination and prejudice. This move last December saw ministers urge other public bodies to follow suit amid fears of a swelling “ersity industry” in taxpayer-funded bodies. A government spokesman said: “The Civil Service is committed to creating a erse and inclusive workspace.”More from NewsPfizer booster jab reduces risk of Covid hospitalisation by 93pcCool name: Melting glacier named after Glasgow to mark Cop26Boris Johnson pledges £50m to Afghanistan appealWe need our own homegrown renewable energy if we are to future-proof BritainOwen Paterson is victim of \u0026#39broken political system\u0026#39 over lobbying inquiry, says daughterWhitehall \u0026#39resistance\u0026#39 could derail Boris Johnson\u0026#39s pledge on hydrogenMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"fathers ordeal shows political system broken","story":"Over the past few months, it has slowly dawned on me that my family is not just the victim of a personal tragedy. We are also victims of a broken political system with no regard for its human cost.Last year, my mother took her own life. Last week, my father, the MP Owen Paterson, was condemned by the Parliamentary Standards Committee for “paid advocacy”. One might think his wife’s suicide was punishment enough, particularly as our mother had become deeply anxious about the manner in which the investigation was conducted.Evidently not. On Wednesday, the Commons will vote on the Committee’s report and its recommended punishment, a 30 day suspension, which could trigger a by-election. As well as his wife of 40 years, he stands to lose his career and hard-earned reputation.It’s an easy narrative isn’t it? One well-suited to lazy dissemination across the Twittersphere. Sleazy Tory funded by big business got what he deserved. Except it could not be more wrong.Having lived with my father during lockdown, my brothers and I have lived through this nightmare while grieving our beloved mother. I know I am not an objective observer. But anybody with any common sense could see that this process has been handled shockingly badly and my father is a victim of a terrible miscarriage of justice. A raft of lawyers has advised us throughout and at no point has any of them found any wrongdoing at all on my father’s part.One would at least expect a complex investigation like this to be conducted by a lawyer. In addition, the person suspected of breaching the rules should be interviewed and witnesses spoken to before any decision is reached. This process should last a few weeks not two years, particularly if the person involved suffers a traumatic bereavement during that time. During the process they should be entitled to defend themselves publicly. My father was given none of these basic legal rights. The fact that the final report is full of factual errors, while accusing him of playing the victim, is a further injustice.Worse, he is being punished for trying to save lives. In every case, he was seeking to right a “serious wrong” as permitted by the Rules, either by alerting the authorities to dangerous carcinogens in milk and ham or the life-threatening consequences of not calibrating medical equipment given by Dfid to developing countries. Experts confirm milk and ham are now safer for consumers due to my father’s actions. Do we really want to prevent MPs from attempting to right wrongs?The fundamental question is: what does this say about our political system? To me, that it is broken and inhumane. Partisanship and self-interest now take precedence over principle and reason. Parliamentary privilege is no longer a safeguard protecting MPs from tyrannical monarchs but a mechanism to abuse them outside the legal system. MPs are no longer treated as human beings with families but symbols of ideologies unworthy of compassion. None of this is new politics is politics.But it comes at a terrible human cost. No sane person will enter politics in the knowledge that they will be subject to abuse, their reputation and family could be destroyed for no reason, and their life could be in danger. I certainly won’t. If Parliament votes to suspend my father it will be a validation of this broken system and the pattern of abuse will continue. I would not wish this ordeal on any other family, but I fear we may not be alone.More from NewsPfizer booster jab reduces risk of Covid hospitalisation by 93pcCool name: Melting glacier named after Glasgow to mark Cop26Boris Johnson pledges £50m to Afghanistan appealWe need our own homegrown renewable energy if we are to future-proof BritainOwen Paterson is victim of \u0026#39broken political system\u0026#39 over lobbying inquiry, says daughterWhitehall \u0026#39resistance\u0026#39 could derail Boris Johnson\u0026#39s pledge on hydrogenMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"fragonards swing has cleaned risque ever","story":"The famously risqué painting \u0027The Swing\u0027 may depict a love triangle, experts have said, after restoration reveals the artwork was even more sensual than previously thought.In the enigmatic woodland scene a young woman is depicted being pushed through the air on a swing by a middle-aged man in the background, while in the foreground an enraptured young gentleman gazes up at her.The 1768 artwork by French painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard, famed for his erotic Rococco creations, has undergone two months of cleaning at the Wallace Collection, which has revealed new details of a love triangle long obscured by a thick layer of varnish.Restoration work has confirmed that the man in the background is not standing like a servant to swing his employer, but sitting as a social equal to both her and the younger gentleman - hinting that he could be a legitimate rival to her affections.The young lady’s “thrilled” expression in the centre of this potential love triangle, and the more erotic details of her appearance have also been restored to their original qualities.“We see how sensual she is,” said Yuriko Jackall, curatorial lead at the Wallace Collection in London. “Her physical nature is brought out, we see the curves of her figure more than before.“It\u0027s clear that she’s wearing a garter, and we can now more clearly see a flash of her upper thigh.“She has become more sensual. Her expression seems more alert, she’s thrilled.“You see her in different way. The pink is so much more vibrant in the way it stands out again the blue green background.”She added: “The major revelation is to put the female figure back in the centre to give her sense of dynamism.”The painting was commissioned by a French courtier, who demanded his lover be painted “on an escarpolette (swing) that a bishop would set in motion.”The commission was first offered to Gabriel-François Doyen, who turned it down and was subsequently replaced by Fragonard.The artist ignored the request for a bishop, and the cleaning revealed that the middle-aged man - sometimes theorised to be the episcopal figure - is in fact wearing blue and not the black garb of the church. His expression has also been brought out more clearly by the extensive restoration work.Ms Jackall said: “I do think it’s a very intriguing expression. he looks he’s smiling in a way that seems very happy.“You do start to realise that the two men aren’t necessarily aware of each other, and that she is perhaps the only one that knows the whole story.“As I\u0027ve spent more time with this older gentleman I get the impression he’s totally oblivious, he might well be swinging his wife, he doesn’t know what’s going on. He’s very happy.”The Wallace Collection houses the largest collection of Fragonard work outside France, where he was popular in the 18th-century era of libertinism, before the morality of the Enlightenment made his works less fashionable.Dr Xavier Bray, director of the Wallace Collection, said: We have approached the conservation of Fragonard’s masterpiece with great sensitivity and an acute awareness of our responsibility to the public to preserve this iconic painting.“The results have been astonishing, and Fragonard’s true genius has been revealed.”More from NewsPfizer booster jab reduces risk of Covid hospitalisation by 93pcCool name: Melting glacier named after Glasgow to mark Cop26Boris Johnson pledges £50m to Afghanistan appealWe need our own homegrown renewable energy if we are to future-proof BritainOwen Paterson is victim of \u0026#39broken political system\u0026#39 over lobbying inquiry, says daughterWhitehall \u0026#39resistance\u0026#39 could derail Boris Johnson\u0026#39s pledge on hydrogenMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"weak tories taking us back seventies","story":"When Boris Johnson sailed into Downing Street in 2019 it was on a wave of optimism. After a decade of hung Parliaments and weak governments, here was a Conservative who then won a real majority and a real mandate. And not just a Conservative but a Conservative who the country seemed to love, an optimistic figure who promised brighter days. A man who was not just going to do what the electorate told the politicians to do in 2016 but who believed in the British future.Of course, all politicians end up being the creation of events, but still there is something especially bitter about the fact that Boris Johnson would appear to be leading Britain back to the 1970s. Because it increasingly feels like it is that un-missed decade that the present government is returning us to.The recent fuel shortages were caused by many things. They are a global issue and have been worsened by a worldwide shortage of heavy goods vehicle drivers. But the sight of cars backed up at petrol stations and drivers swapping rumours of places reported to have fuel supplies are not things that people are likely to forget.For those old enough to remember the 1970s, they were deeply reminiscent of the shortages which affected the country then. What the present crop of ministers seem to have forgotten is that it was only the genuine Conservatism of Margaret Thatcher’s government in the 1980s that did away with such problems.Perhaps the greatest change that the Thatcher government enacted was that performed by her revolutionary chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson. Before Lawson, the UK had performed the experiment that so many flailing Leftists still try to perform: they believed that the country could become rich by taxing the rich.It was the insight of Lawson, along with a crucial collection of Right-wing economists, that if you lowered the tax rates not only would the tax pot increase but the fuel of the economy would go into superdrive. So it was. When people know they are working for themselves they work harder. But when a majority or near majority of their earnings goes to the government then a deep stasis beds in, one which affects the inidual and then from the inidual seeps out across the whole of wider society.The Conservatives of the 1980s got Britain out of that mire of a high-tax, low-innovation society. Yet it is the Conservative Government of today that seems to be returning us to it.Naturally, some aspect of this has been out of their hands. During the coronavirus pandemic the whole world was in a situation that proved very far from business as usual. Staring at the options, the Government in this country – as in developed economies across the world – chose basically to buy up the economy for a period of time. They opted to keep whole sectors afloat on borrowed money. That period had to end, but it also had to be paid for. And that is part of the explanation for Rishi Sunak’s budget this week.The Chancellor has been adept at hiding some of the bad news. Not least by adding complexity to an already complex tax system. But the bottom line is that those who do the most for the economy will be taxed even more. Tax-payers in the highest bracket – that is those earning over £150,000 a year – will be taxed at a figure very nearly nudging 50 per cent. At 45 per cent the Conservatives are getting perilously close to the point at which they make top-rate taxpayers spend more time working for the state than for themselves. They already are, if you include national insurance.Such taxpayers are not a popular group of people to stand up for. More demagoguery can be achieved by lambasting higher earners than by expressing any sympathy for them. But we have been here before. The politics that thought that higher earners were both the problem and the piggy-bank was the politics that brought us to the economic slump of the 1970s.Worse is that a Conservative Government should be instituting these tax hikes while all the time showering money on an entirely unreformed public sector. Every part of it exemplifies the lazy big-state problem. On matters grand and pedestrian the behemoth asserts itself in the old familiar way.For instance, the Civil Service has been unsurprisingly reluctant to return to normal office working patterns. Recent negotiations with them centred on the desire of civil servants to invert their post-Covid working week. Their preferred option appeared to be in favour of going into the office for perhaps a couple of days a week and then having five days at home in the garden to recover from the strain.With other parts of the public sector it is even worse. The NHS is the reason why this country went into endless lockdowns and stasis during the Covid era. Again and again it was explained to us that we needed to protect the NHS, rather than the NHS protect us. The reality was that a Tory government lived in terror of the health service buckling. All those Labour lies about the Conservatives wanting to destroy the NHS would have run on for several more generations if anything remotely like that had happened, and so they showered the health service not just with love but with cash.This week, Sunak committed yet more billions to the NHS. The old joke of Britain being an NHS with a nice country attached is coming to look perilously true. The Government behaves as though it is held hostage by the health service, just as the country was held hostage by the coal miners in the 1970s. Even the new money that is being committed is intended to address problems – like patient backlogs – which the NHS itself needs to explain.But it never does. Instead of accounting for its shortcomings, the NHS just gets another cash injection from a terrified government.When a government is this scared of making bold moves or is captivated by the arguments of its opponents then it is hardly surprising that the country looks like it is sliding backwards all these decades. Across the country in recent weeks a group of rabid and extremist protesters from Insulate Britain, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, have been blocking major roadways, an echo of the disruption ushered in by the strikers of the 1970s.They are a pest and a menace. Yet these people who have been literally trying to block the economic arteries of our country have been getting away with it. Policemen stand around observing the pandemonium as though they are recording the events for some future purpose. Others negotiate with the occasional road-sitting granny, as though she were a jihadi with a suicide vest ready to blow.It has been members of the public who have had to do what the police will not do and haul these wretched nuisances out of the roadway. Often, happily, by the scruff of their necks. Why should the public have to do this? Only because this Government lives in fear of telling the police what they need to do. Just as they live in fear of telling the NHS what to do.So what, if anything, is the agenda of this Government? It appears that the aim is to become greener at all costs – even at the expense of soaring fuel supplies – and otherwise to be a high-spending, high-taxing welfare superstate. We will see what happens as the fuel bills keep coming in. And we will see if the fuel itself even does keep coming. But in the meantime we can say that the route this Government is taking is a route that cannot work. Because we have been here before.That time the Conservatives came in to save us. How strange it is that this time they are the people who have got us here.More from NewsPfizer booster jab reduces risk of Covid hospitalisation by 93pcCool name: Melting glacier named after Glasgow to mark Cop26Boris Johnson pledges £50m to Afghanistan appealWe need our own homegrown renewable energy if we are to future-proof BritainOwen Paterson is victim of \u0026#39broken political system\u0026#39 over lobbying inquiry, says daughterWhitehall \u0026#39resistance\u0026#39 could derail Boris Johnson\u0026#39s pledge on hydrogenMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"winter wont bleak last","story":"“There is no alternative. From Thursday until the start of December, you must stay at home.”These words were uttered on national television a year ago today by Boris Johnson as he stood at his Downing Street podium – flanked by his trusty academic lieutenants Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance – plunging the country into a month-long lockdown. The Prime Minister’s sombre words were accompanied by terrifying graphs presented by the po-faced scientists which showed cases, hospitalisations and deaths soaring unchecked. SAGE modelling was wheeled out for good measure which claimed it was feasible England could see 4,000 deaths a day if no action was taken. With a vaccine still a pipedream, the only thing to be done, in the eyes of Mr Johnson, was the reimposition of draconian restrictions to confine people to their homes. The lockdown worked, to an extent, and curtailed the pandemic for a few weeks. But come December, the second wave erupted as a new strain of coronavirus, the so-called Kent variant – later rebadged as “alpha” – tore through the UK and cancelled Christmas.More than 75,000 Britons died of coronavirus between Hallowee’n 2020 and March 2021, with the winter dwarfing the spring wave of March 2020. And now, with record levels of virus prevalence in the community once more, some are calling for Plan B measures.One year ago, there were around 20,000 new cases a day, almost half the current figure. Data from the Office for National Statistics show 1.1 million people are likely currently infected with the virus, around one in 50 people, twice the figure for the same time last year. So, it is beyond doubt that there are more new infections every day now than at the same point in 2020, and there is more of the virus around in total. However, comparing 2020 and now is the same as comparing apples and pears the coronavirus is not as potent as it once was as a result of various factors, not least of which is the vaccine programme. Vaccination has altered the entire complexion of the country’s ongoing arm wrestle with SARS-CoV-2, weakening the link between infection, hospitalisation and death.Evidence now suggests a double-jabbed inidual is around 80 per cent less at-risk of infection, and they are around 97 per cent less at risk of hospitalisation or death. Figures from the UK Health Security Agency, the replacement for Public Health England, show that people who are double-jabbed are far less likely to be admitted to hospital. The current hospitalisation rate in vaccinated 70-somethings is 25 per 100,000 people, but for those who are unvaccinated, the risk is almost thrice as high, at 68 per 100,000. A similar relationship exists for all age groups. And so, if cases no longer provide an early indicator of the pandemic’s trajectory, what metric is used to inform policy decisions? For that, we must look at hospitalisations, the number of occupied hospital beds, and the number of deaths.In 2020, the level of Covid hospital admissions was higher than it is currently (1,225 a day versus 839). But back then, they were on a steep climb, rising uninhibited. Now, they are fairly stable, and perhaps even showing signs of dropping. We have not hit 1,000 admissions a day in England since February. The rate of increase in hospitalisations at the moment is 1.6 per cent. In 2020, it was increasing at a rate four times this. The rate of increase – the steepness of the lines on the graphs we are inundated with – was four times greater a year ago for the number of Covid patients on ventilators and 13 times higher for the rate of increase in deaths. In summary, deaths and hospitalisations are creeping up slowly compared to this time last year. The current state of play is optimistic when compared to 2020, but it also looks promising going forward. SAGE’s sub-committee SPI-M have created models throughout the pandemic showing what will likely happen under a specific set of circumstances. In October 2020, they said it is possible 4,000 people could die a day, in reality, the peak was around 1,200. In September of this year, they said it was possible 7,000 people could be admitted to hospital a day by mid-October. This, again, was wildly out, with the real figure a shade under 1,000. But the notoriously pessimistic group on Friday released a new set of medium-term projections and, for once, the image is rosy. They believe the trajectory of hospital admissions and deaths will remain under control and that instead of a recurrence of the fearsome spikes of yester-waves, this winter will likely be a gentle knoll. Modelling from Imperial College London was also released on Friday showing that, assuming the booster programme rolls out well and confers good protection for the next five months – which prevailing evidence shows it should, then it is possible there are just 5,300 deaths by March 31 – 14 times less than for the same timeframe in 2020. Even in the most pessimistic scenario, there will be less than 10,000 deaths.But there are other tools in the Covid armoury now that were absent in the dark days of the winter wave.Against the backdrop of vaccination, we now also have antivirals, monoclonal antibodies and dexamethasone. As effective treatments continue to be discovered, the patients who do become critically ill with Covid are recovering better than they were a year ago.Data from Icnarc, the intensive care national audit and research centre, also published on Friday, show that fewer critical cases are dying survivors are recovering quicker the number of people needing advanced respiratory or cardiovascular support is dropping and even when these chronically ill patients do need such interventions, they spend less time on organ support.Most experts believe that barring an unexpected hiccup – such as a new variant which can dodge the vaccine or a catastrophic failure with the booster campaign – it seems increasingly unlikely that the NHS will be overwhelmed by Covid cases this winter.Last year, Mr Johnson concluded his press conference by saying: “I can tell you tonight that the scientists may be unanimously gloomy about the immediate options, but they are unanimously optimistic about the medium- and the long-term future.”On this, at least, it seems he and his scientific advisors were correct. More from NewsPfizer booster jab reduces risk of Covid hospitalisation by 93pcCool name: Melting glacier named after Glasgow to mark Cop26Boris Johnson pledges £50m to Afghanistan appealWe need our own homegrown renewable energy if we are to future-proof BritainOwen Paterson is victim of \u0026#39broken political system\u0026#39 over lobbying inquiry, says daughterWhitehall \u0026#39resistance\u0026#39 could derail Boris Johnson\u0026#39s pledge on hydrogenMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/N0O0lX8z/poster.jpg","title":"uk covid infection rate europe","story":"Article bookmarkedFind your bookmarks in your Independent Premium section, under my profileDon\u0026#x27t show me this message again✕✕CloseRelated video: UK Covid-19 cases surge, hospitals strained Cases of Covid-19 in the UK are currently among the highest in Europe and are higher than they were this time last year, when parts of England were under local lockdowns.The vaccine has meant that although case numbers are elevated, there are fewer cases of people with serious illness having to be treated in hospital.

Hospital admission numbers are still below levels seen last autumn, although they are rising gradually.According to Professor Neil Ferguson, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) from Imperial College London, there are “a number of reasons” why the UK currently has higher infection levels than many other European countries.Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, the professor suggested that the UK has “lower functional immunity in our population than most other western European countries” for a number of reasons.According to Professor Ferguson these reasons include the vaccine rollout starting earlier in the UK than elsewhere and the fact that “we relied more on the AstraZeneca vaccine”.There are other suggestions that less mask wearing, more relaxed rules around mixing and a slowing vaccine rollout could also be behind the surge in figures. But why exactly are cases of Covid rising in the UK?Waning immunity?The UK was one of the fastest countries in the world to rollout the Covid-19 vaccine, meaning that immunity of some of those who were first vaccinated may be lower now.A study of Covid test results of vaccinated people who logged their symptoms in an app, suggested that after about five or six months, the protection against catching the virus wanes significantly.Join our new commenting forumJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesView  comments"},{"url":null,"title":"covid stop spread tips winter","story":" simple ways to stop the spread of Covid - including new -minute ruleThe future looks a lot brighter than it did this time last year thanks to the vaccination rollout, but Covid is still here so we must do our bit to prevent its transmissionAdvertorialByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct Cold and flu season always puts pressure on the NHS, and although the Covid vaccines are the best line of defence against the virus, you can still catch it evenyou’re fully vaccinated. You can spread it to others too, and what might be no worse than a cold for you could spell danger to more vulnerable people. Cases are already high after theto school and university, and as peopleto the workplace and socialise indoors, they could rise further. But there are some simple steps you can take to stay safe... Let fresh air in  You’re much more likely to catch Covid- indoors, especially in a confined space with no ventilation. The risk isn’t just about being near other people – mixing indoors can lead to a build-up of the virus in the atmosphere. Meeting outdoors is safer, but that’s not always possible when it’s cold and raining. So whether you’re at home or at work, let fresh air in wherever you can. Leave vents open and windows ajar. If you’re having visitors round, open the windows for ten minutes before, during and after. Don’t worry about losing heat from the houseyou give it a good blast of fresh air – it will soon build up again. Wear a face covering One in three people with Covid- has no symptoms – and you can still get ityou’re fully vaccinated, so it makes sense to wear a face covering indoors whenever you can. Although the rules no longer require you to do so in some indoor settings, you’re protecting others when you wear it. Make sure it covers both your mouth and nose becauseyou do have Covid-, you can release contagious droplets every time you breathe out. So next time you hop on the bus or pop to the shop, think about wearing a face covering to protect those around you – and hopefully they’ll be doing the same. Get testedTaking regular rapid lateral flow tests gives you peace of mind – they’re free, easy to do and give results within  minutes. Go to nhs.uk get-tested or call  to order a pack. They’re also available at some pharmacies: first visit gov.uk get-collect-code to get a code that you will need to show when you collect them.You may also wish to consider taking a testyou’re likely to be in a higher-risk situation that day – for example, mixing in a crowded indoor space such as a nightclub, or visiting vulnerable people. Doing a test will reassure you that you are unlikely to be infectious with Covid-. If you do test positive, you can take action to help stop the virus spreading. Let’s send our children back to school safely. “It is a very good test,” says Public Health England’s Susan Hopkins. “Rapid lateral flow devices are effective at finding people with high viral loads who are most likely to transmit the virus to others.”It’s important to report all test results, whether they’re positive, negative or void, because that helps identy outbreaks early – you can do this at gov.uk report-covid-result, or call  free from your mobile or landline.Take a testyou think you have Covid  If you have symptomsyou must take a PCR test immediately, which you can book online. Evenyour symptoms are mild or you’re not sure, it’s worth getting tested. You can either go to a local test centre or you will be sent a PCR test to do at home. Don’t leave home until you get the result, andyou test positive you’ll need to self-isolate from the day your symptoms startedfor ten days. NHS Test and Trace will continue to protect the public this winter, by helping to break the chains of transmission – and they will inform youyou’ve been in close contact with someone who’s tested positive for Covid. If they contact you, they’ll tell you exactly what you need to do, so just follow their advice.Keep up to date with your jabs  Vaccination is the best defence against serious Covid-related illness. You can still get Covid and pass it onyou’re vaccinated, but it’s a vital step to keep yourself safe. Make sure you book your Covid and flu jabs when invited. This autumn, Covid booster jabs are being offered to more vulnerable groups such as people over , over-s with certain health conditions and frontline health and social care workers, including those who work in care homes.“As we approach winter, everyone should keep following the simple steps to protect themselves and others. “Avoid mixing with othersyou feel unwell, get a PCR test straight awayyou have any Covid symptoms andyou’re meeting people indoors, make sure you let fresh air in. “Remember, the best way to protect yourself and others against Covid- is to get the vaccine, so please do come forwardyouare eligible.”"},{"url":null,"title":"a green revolution reindustrialise north","story":"A green revolution will reindustrialise the North - and really improve peoples livesAhead of COP, Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham says the government has a chance to prove its serious about levelling up - with his region aiming to be net zero by Andy Burnham says he wants to ensure climate justice goes hand in hand with social justic Image: James McCauley REX ShutterstockopinionByAndy Burnham:,  Oct | comments A green revolution is the best chance we’ll ever have to reindustrialise the north of England - and really improve people’s lives. It’s also an opportunity for the government to show how serious it is about levelling up. I want to ensure climate justice goes hand in hand with social justice - delivering better homes, better jobs and better public transport. One of the big themes of COP will be how cities and regions can drive change, be the early adopters of new technology and build the skills base needed for a green economy to thrive. In Greater Manchester, we are aiming to reach net zero by  -  years ahead of the government target of . Our trams already run on renewable energy and our plan is to electry our buses now we have brought them back under public control.That will create the UK’s first net zero integrated public transport system. In Trafford, we are growing a green hydrogen cluster. This will enable us to create fuel which originates from plants and uses entirely renewable energy sources. In Liverpool, there are plans to harness tidal power from the River Mersey, which could power up to one million homes. And in Newcastle, there is a state of the art offshore and wind energy training facility. Retrofitting - the practice of modying existing buildings and helping to insulate them - will bring huge benefits. Although it is costly, it will mean families make long term savings on homes which are cheaper to heat.Weaposve already had funding to do some retrofitting in publicly owned buildings, such as schools and libraries.The next logical step is looking at publicly and socially owned housing stock and the government should think seriously about subsidising this.Retrofitting could also provide jobs with real longevity in the parts of the country which have suffered the most from the loss of traditional industry.At no point in my letime have I ever been able to tell young people thatthey train in a particular set of skills that they’ll have a good chance of a job for le. But industry body Net Zero North West estimates that retrofitting could bring , jobs to our region. These people will then be equipped with skills they can take to other parts of the country. We’ve also got to turn the economics of transport on its head. It was a surprise to hear the Chancellor prioritise the cutting of air fares in his Budget, rather than cutting rail and bus fares.When it is cheaper to catch a plane than a train, or when itaposs cheaper to get an Uber than catch a bus, youaposve got a problem that this Government is failing to address.The free market has not given us transport people can afford.

Labouraposs Deputy Leader said she had reflected on her language during a recent period of bereavement leave after losing a close loved one.Ms Rayner said she unreservedly apologised for her remarks and she would be more careful about the language she uses in future. In the wake of the murder of Tory MP Sir David Amess, which police are treating as a terrorist incident, Ms Rayner said she had thought hard about the threats and abuse that feature in political le. In a statement shared with the Mirror, she said: I was angry about where our country is headed and policies that have made le harder for so many people I represent. But I would like to unreservedly apologise for the language I used, and I would not use it again. I will continue to speak my mind, stand up for Labour values and hold the government to account. But in the future I will be more careful about how I do that and in the language that I choose. Angela Rayneraposs full statement is at the bottom of this article  All of us in positions of leadership have a responsibility for our language and rhetoric, whether towards political opponents or anyone  in society, especially those already most vulnerable. As Deputy Leader of the Labour Party I take this responsibility with the utmost seriousness and I am sure that politicians from all parties, the media and others with a prominent role in our public le will also reflect on this shared responsibility. The row centred on comments Ms Rayner made to Labour members from the North West of England at last monthaposs conference in Brighton.In an informal speech, she joked about the quality of food at conference and slapped down a heckler who apparently urged her to challenge Keir Starmer, saying: Youaposve had all the wine that I havenapost had mate!She told members weaposre at a cross roads like in , saying: We face a global threat again. Many of our comrades havenapost made it. Everyone in this room will know somebody whoaposs been seriously ill or died from Covid. Weaposve been through so much and deserve so much better than what weaposve got. She added: I’m sick of shouting from the sidelines and I bet youse lot are as well. We cannot get any worse than a bunch of scum, homophobic, racist, misogynistic, absolute vile [inaudible] Banana Republic, vile, nasty, Etonian [inaudible] piece of scum.” Ms Rayner originally stood by her remarks despite furious demands from Tory MPs for an apology. Keir Starmer distanced himself from the remarks, saying he would not have used them.  Askedshe was talking about Tories in general, Ms Rayner said last month: No, let me be clear, I am talking about members of the Cabinet. She told Sky News last month: I am not saying that anyone who voted for the Conservatives are racist, scummy and homophobic… I’m saying the Prime Minister has said those things and acted in that way. If the Prime Minister wants to apologise and remove himself from those comments he’s made that are homophobic, racist and misogynistic then I will apologise for calling him scummy. Boris Johnson has faced criticism over his past comments, including when he dubbed gay men tank-topped bum boys and described black people as piccaninnies with watermelon smiles. In a  Spectator column, Mr Johnson described children of single mothers as ill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate”. In her statement today, Ms Rayner also spoke out over the terrying threats she has received in the wake of the row over her comments.They have had a devastating impact on me, my children and others close to me, she said.It shakes you when you get these threats. You worry about the safety of your home, your office and everything in your le. And it takes its toll on the people who work for me too. She said her staff should not be required to deal with death threats on a day-to-day basis. Two men have been arrested since yesterday in South Yorkshire and Halax as part of a police investigation into “threatening and abusive phone calls, emails and letters” to Ms Rayner. It is understood further enquiries are still ongoing across multiple police forces. A third man, Benjamin Ilfe, , of Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, today pleaded guilty to sending a threatening email to Ms Rayner, and also pleaded guilty to possessing a quantity of cannabis on Wednesday when he was arrested. The former delivery driver warned Ms Rayner to watch your back and your kids and said I already found your personal home address in the threatening email on October , Huntingdon Magistratesapos Court heard. Ilfe was sentenced to  weeks in prison suspended for  months. A probation officer told the court Ilfe had felt Ms Rayner was partially responsible for the attack on Sir David following her use of language. He was later apologetic and remorseful for sending the threatening e-mail, the court heard.  Angela Rayneraposs statement in full I have been off work over the last couple of weeks after losing a close loved one. Grief is the burden we bear for love and losing someone close is something that we all experience at some point in our lives, but that knowledge doesn’t make it any easier when it happens to you. So I can’t imagine what the family of Sir David Amess are going through, but I know they will be hurting. I send my heartfelt condolences to them. Sir David was a fine parliamentarian, a proud advocate for his constituents and above all such a kind, generous and warm-hearted man. He will be missed on all sides of the House. As a society we need to offer better support to people who are going through bereavement, loss and other traumatic or dficult experiences in their personal lives. I hope that the fact that I took time to deal with a bereavement will encourage other people to do the same when they are going through grief or trauma. While I have been away from the cut and thrust of Parliament I have reflected on our political debate and the threats and abuse that now seem to feature all too often. I have also reflected on what I said at an event at Labour Party conference. I was angry about where our country is headed and policies that have made le harder for so many people I represent. But I would like to unreservedly apologise for the language I used, and I would not use it again. I will continue to speak my mind, stand up for Labour values and hold the government to account. But in the future I will be more careful about how I do that and in the language that I choose. All of us in positions of leadership have a responsibility for our language and rhetoric, whether towards political opponents or anyone  in society, especially those already most vulnerable. As Deputy Leader of the Labour Party I take this responsibility with the utmost seriousness and I am sure that politicians from all parties, the media and others with a prominent role in our public le will also reflect on this shared responsibility. I want to address the threats I have received recently. In the past I have been reluctant to speak out about the abuse that I receive because I fear that doing so will only make the situation worse. However, in recent weeks the threats that I have received against my le and the lives of close family have been so terrying and explicit that I could not stay silent and simply continue to take it as ‘part of the job’. They have had a devastating impact on me, my children and others close to me. It shakes you when you get these threats. You worry about the safety of your home, your office and everything in your le. And it takes its toll on the people who work for me too. My staff come to work and do their jobs with dedication and professionalism. They bear the brunt of much of this abuse and then get on with their working day. Dealing with death threats and liaising with the police about their safety should not be a standard part of the day-to-day working le of a Member of Parliament or their staff. So I want to thank the police officers from Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire and Cambridgeshire Police who have arrested a number of people in recent days and demonstrated the utmost professionalism, courtesy and kindness both in carrying out their investigations and in supporting me, my family and my staff during what has been a very dficult time. I and my team will continue work with them to ensure that the perpetrators of these crimes are brought to justice After attending a funeral on Monday I will be back to work, rolling my sleeves up and standing up for my brilliant constituents in Ashton-under-Lyne, Droylsden and Failsworth – along with everyone who needs a Labour government.

Tens of thousands of negotiators and officials will try to wrestle more money and pledges out of rich nations at COP. The UN summit is aiming to “keep . alive” - limit global temperature rises to less than . degrees Celsius. Boris Johnson and US President Joe Biden will attend the glittering event, though the Queen has pulled out due to health issues.The -day summit is the th COP, which means “conference of the parties” to the UN Framework on climate change. It is being held at the Scottish Event Campus , which includes a ,-seat auditorium, ,-capacity arena and five exhibition and meeting spaces.  This year the UK has the Presidency of COP. It’s our job to bring together  nations in a historic set of pacts - with the gavel coming down on Friday  November. What will you do to save the planet  Join the debate in the comments below  Butsix friends can barely agree on a pub, imagine getting  countries to agree on the future of the world. Boris Johnson admitted this week he is “very worried” it “might go wrong” and end without the right agreement. “It’s touch and go,” the Prime Minister said - hosing down expectations after he was criticised for setting them too high. And today Boris Johnson is holding last-minute talks with G leaders in Rome, calling for concrete steps on coal, cars, cash and trees so we can keep . alive and stay on track for net zero. He will send a warning shot, with his spokesman saying too many countries are still doing too little and the success of COP hangs in the balance. We cannot create a better future while running down the clock on climate., his spokesman warned. Much of the focus will be on global diplomacy and late-night talks in sweaty conference rooms, thrashing out agreement.It’s also likely to be speckled with a string of UK announcements, after the PM’s Net Zero Strategy was criticised for offering only a handful of £, heat pump grants and giving no final cost of getting to net zero emissions by . So after all the headlines, how will COP actually work  What do we need to get out of it  And how will it affect your le  Here’s everything you need to know.What the world is trying to achieveUnlike the Paris COP of , there won’t be one flashy new agreement signed by the world leaders in Glasgow. Instead, there will be a series of smaller agreements patched together in a bid to keep what’s already promised on track. These include:‘Keeping . alive’The Paris Agreement in pledged a goal to limit global warming to C, preferably .C, compared to pre-industrial levels.But to keep within .C by the year , the UN says the world will need to HALVE annual greenhouse gas emissions in the next eight years.And a damning UN report has warned current pledges will tip us towards a global temperature rise of .C by the end of the century. That would swallow up whole cities and island nations as seas rise due to “catastrophic changes in the earth’s climate”, the UN warned. It’s understood the UK doesn’t expect that projection to come down to .C due to COP, but wants a “plausible” chance of closing the gap by . Pushing for countries’ new emissions plansThe Paris Agreement made a pledge of .C, but didn’t at that point have anywhere near enough solid plans to achieve it. So the agreement contains a system to “ratchet” up nations’ pledges to cut their carbon emissions every five years - starting in Glasgow. Muchof the ratcheting is done through Nationally Determined Contributions , which were due to be submitted before COP. But these may come down to stressful, last-minute talks with nations trading off what they think they can stomach politically and economically. Vast nations like China and India still haven’t submitted their NDCs and could wait until the climax of the summit.Closing the gigaton gapTo ‘keep . alive’, the world needs to cut global emissions by  gigatons of CO equivalent by  - over and above unconditional NDCs. UK officials think they might get one gigaton of commitment from China and . from India. Wider policy decisions like cutting coal use are crucial. One source admitted “we’re never going to get” to the target by mid-November” - but  gigatons would be a good outcome from COP. Getting billion a yearAt COP in Copenhagen in , the parties agreed to “mobilise” billion a year for poorer nations by  to deal with climate change. But the pledge has been missed and a report has suggested the target will not be met until , three years late. That is despite US President Joe Biden announcing he would double America’s commitment to .bn, bringing the running total closer to bn. The bn commitment from public and private finance helps nations that have caused the least climate change but are most vulnerable to it.How does the summit actually work The summit is being held from Monday  November to Friday  November - bookended by world leaders glad-handing at either end. It is not being held online despite soaring Covid cases because smaller nations fear they would lose their voice - or ability to press home a deal - on a shaky Zoom connection. Tens of thousands of attendees will gather inside a ‘blue zone’ at the SEC, taking daily lateral flow tests to try to prevent a super-spreader event. Boris Johnson will meet allies on November - and there was due to be a reception hosted by the Queen, though she will no longer come. The rest of the week will be taken up with rattling through the “backlog” of less controversial plans from the last two years.  In week two the focus will sht onto the more dficult political issues. A source said: “It will run late into the night - especially in the second week. “It’s going to go long, it’s going to be messy.” COP President Alok Sharma - a UK minister - will spend % of his time darting round negotiating rooms trying to keep ious delegations happy. That will then lead up to a moment of agreement on the final Friday when a series of deals are sealed - more on this below. At the same time as all this there are themes for each day - energy, youth, nature, gender, transport, cities for example - as well as a dazzling array of side events, lobbying organisations and protests outside the venue.What are the big pinch points The obvious problem is persuading the world’s nations to come up with something ambitious enough, as they grapple with politics back home and the ructions of Covid- on their economies. This is shown in a leak to Greenpeace, which claimed countries were lobbying for changes to a UN report on how the world should tackle climate change. Documents named countries including Australia and Saudi Arabia as those trying to get the report to weaken a conclusion that fossil fuels should be phased out. Brazil and Argentina also reportedly made comments pressing report authors to delete messages about the climate benefits of undertaking a plant-based diet, despite a study in  finding that moving to a meat-free diet could cut food land use, and reduce emissions by %. And the Australian government asked to be deleted from a list of the worldaposs major producers and consumers of coal, despite being the fth largest coal producer, Greenpeace said.  Closely linked is the attempt to get more action from “non-state actors” - better known as global corporations,  of which are blamed for % of the world’s emissions in a  report. Those companies will need action in their own right - not just to be compelled by governments - to get the world on the right side of .. Deforestation is a tricky issue, with a few countries - such as Brazil, led by tree-chopping Jair Bolsonaro - responsible for much of it. Boris Johnson made a personal plea on the issue to Russia’s Vladimir Putin this week. A final pinch point is persuading the most vulnerable nations - from Bangladesh to island states like Barbados, Fiji, Costa Rica, Marshall Islands - to back plans. A UK source suggested they are “swing voters” and “whoever wins them wins COP”. “Some of these guys are facing the existential loss of their nation above . degrees”, they added.How will the deal get sealed Friday  November is the big day to seal the deal - or is it The last COP in Madrid ran  HOURS late - and sources have not ruled out a similarly nightmarish late finish in Glasgow.On the Friday some world leaders are due to , while other leaders - such as those of island states - are likely to have stayed in the Scottish city throughout. Together they will “gavel” a set of documents, some long and technical, all topped by a document called  CP.. The UK wants this document to allude to progress on NDCs and policies and address the  emissions gap.From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times. The newsletter is sent out twice daily with the latest UK  world politics news, along with leading opinion and analysis.You can sign up here. Why does it matter to you With all the high politics inside a top-security ‘blue zone’ it can be hard to see how this affects your le. Even some of the practical things, like mangrove planting in Barbados, can seem terribly far away. But the big numbers agreed at COP will drip down slowly into national policies that will affect your le - and your wallet. The UK is already talking about banning all new gas boilers by  and the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by .Global trade also affects the things you can buy in the supermarket - for example,the use of palm oil reduces across the planet.How does the G fit in Just before COP, world leaders are gathering in Rome today for the G summit of  of the world’s richest nations. Boris Johnson is be among them, having flown out last night on a charter plane with a full delegation of press and aides. But with the G focusing on “people, planet, prosperity”, there’ll be a lot of overlap. It could well end up as a warm-up act to the COP summit that follows. “We see all those issues as being linked, the PMaposs spokesman said. “This is an important moment to use this gathering of world leaders as we come into the final days before COP to look them in the eye and make sure we are getting the level of ambition that’s required to keep . alive.” If things go well, it could give Boris Johnson a “bounce” going into COP - but equally,the G falls flat it could make things tougher when COP kicks off. One bad sign is that the nations of Russia, China, Japan and Mexico are not expected to turn up in Rome - with Putin and Xi not expected at COP either. While all nations are likely to send negotiating teams, it sometimes takes the gravitas of a national leader to get a deal over the line - especially with a country like Russia and China which have a fraught relationship with the UK. Which leaders WILL attend COP While neither Russia’s Putin nor China’s Xi are expected, the leaders of the US, India, the UK, Australia, France, Canada, Turkey, Israel, Colombia and Sweden are all due to turn up in Glasgow. But Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro, who leads a country containing much of the Amazon rainforest, is not expected to go.

And while the disastrous effects of climate change are already causing havoc in countries across the world, there is still time to stop the worst from happening. It is not too much of over-statement to say that the next two weeks in Glasgow will decide this one way or the other. The summit will confirm plenty of good work that is already happening. The worldwide phasing out of coal will be announced this week – to be delivered in the s. As will the switch to electric cars and away from diesel and petrol engines. And the planting of billions more trees to soak up carbon.What do you think of this  Join the debate in our comments But fundamentally, the dference between progress and catastrophe will hang on two make or break decisions. Firstly, just how big each country’s carbon reductions will be during the s. And secondly, just how much financial help rich countries will give poor countries to cut out carbon At the centre of the Paris accords of  was an agreement that countries would ratchet up their carbon reduction ambitions at COP . But now with China likely to refuse to bring its ‘cap’ forward or advance its ‘peak’ level forward from , the best achievable outcome is to agree to ‘kick the cap down the road’.  So our best hope here is not an agreement on new targets but that Glasgow lays the ground for a new target-setting conference in . But any commitments by low and middle income countries to transition to net zero emissions cannot and will not be forthcoming without a dramatic increase in global climate finance. And unless the richest countries make a bolder financial offer to coastal states and developing countries hardest hit by climate induced emergencies, COP  cannot succeed. A burden sharing agreement where rich countries agreed to pay based on their wealth and their culpability for historic emissions would have made sense but instead countries simply offer what they like. As conference chair Britain should be taking the lead, but while Britain has doubled its developing countries funding to £ .bn a year, it has bent the rules - and now seeks to do what no other country has attempted to count loans transferred from the IMF to the UK and the UK back to the IMF as overseas development assistance. But If we are to convince laggards - Australia , Canada, Japan, Italy - to do more or to convince America -whose bn commitment remains too small- to make good their shortfall in financial commitments , then we .Britian, must do better. To reach bn, restore trust and bring developing countries on board we need a new initiative to break the deadlock and I look to John Kerry the US negotiator, President Biden and Mr Sharma to break the deadlock. We must not give up but continue to fight for climate justice - and a world where economic progress and social justice go hand in hand with a sustainable environment. I take heart from the millions of our fellow citizen especially a new generation of young people now aware of t the costs of pollution to their quality of le. Paris, Kyoto and Rio are already on the history books of a cities linked to environmental breakthroughs. I want Glasgow to take its place alongside them as a city associated with real and lasting change on the climate but it will require our political leaders to step up from today and show leadership and imagination.

There was no plan to tackle the growing cost of living crisis. No plan to reduce the tax burden on working people and small businesses. No plan to grow our economy in the years ahead or to create the high-wage high skilled jobs of the future. No plan to deal with the huge challenge of climate change for the years ahead. A Labour budget would have been very dferent, because Labour wants a brighter and better future for our country. We’d have invested in dealing with the challenge of climate change and fitting our country for the future - starting with proper insulation for millions of homes to reduce emissions and drive down soaring heating bills.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section We’d have changed the way the government does business to ensure we buy, make, and sell more in Britain, supporting manufacturers and our amazing small businesses. Growing our economy is the best route to better services and a better future for everyone. It means more jobs and higher tax revenues to invest in our services. Instead, after a decade of weak growth, Wednesday’s budget saw taxation go up to the highest level for seventy years. Working people are paying an ever higher price for eleven years of Tory economic failure. We’d have invested in the future of our public services, especially for children, as we recover from the pandemic, with a properly funded education catch-up plan so every child has the chance to succeed. We only get one chance as a country to get these calls right, and the Tories are getting it wrong. We’d have cancelled the Prime Minister’s new yacht, and spent the money on policing hubs and more special constables.  And we’d have reformed our tax system, as Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves set out at conference. We’d make it fair, so those with the broadest shoulders make the bigger contribution. We’d bring it up to date, so high street family firms face a level playing field with tech giants like Amazon. We’d make it more efficient too, by removing unfair tax breaks, like the one that benefits private schools - and spend that money on giving every child a better start. What we needed was a Budget for our future, for growth, and for our public services. The Tories failed again to deliver what we need. Labour would be building a brighter and better future.

Instead, we got a Chancellor disconnected from the reality of a growing cost of living crisis. As energy bills soar, the Chancellor piled the biggest tax burden in peacetime on working people. As businesses on our high streets are held back by outdated business rates, the Chancellor gave bankers a tax cut. A decade of sluggish growth. Public services cut to the bone. Billions of pounds of taxpayer money wasted. But still, no plan to boost our economy. The Government will always blame others for its failures. But the reality is that working people are paying more for less for three simple reasons. Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section  Economic mismanagement. An unfair tax system. And wasteful spending. Our country deserves better. But they’ll never get it under a Chancellor who gives with one hand, but takes so much more with the other. People are getting wise to this.

We’d tax fairly, spend wisely and after a decade of faltering growth, we’d get Britain’s economy firing on all cylinders. That is what a Labour budget would have done today.

For so long our companies were held back by petty regulations, often from Europe, but now that’s in the past and they’re allowed to pour human sewage into the sea. Instead of going through the palaver of disposing of our waste in complicated ways, it was revealed this week that water companies have been flinging it into the seaside. And the government voted to let them carry on! So our children can enjoy watching pretty shapes float about while they’re paddling. In Tudor times, we were encouraged to chuck our waste into the street. But do-gooding boffins brought in one rule after another, and before long we weren’t even allowed to poke our bums out of our own windows and defecate on to the pavement!  That was the trouble with the th century, it was full of health and safety gone mad. But now the government has voted to allow our water companies to pump our great British turds into the water to boost our seaside towns. Imagine the joy as parents call out to their kids: “Grab your bucket and spade, we’re going to Scarborough to make some poo castles.” The water companies wouldn’t have been allowed to act like thiswe were still tied to the EU. In , Michael Gove promised a “Green Brexit”, and he’s been true to his word, because lots of the jolly sewage must be a very deep shade of green. Ministers reassured us that an amendment to the law will “reverse adverse impacts”, but let’s hope they can keep all the positive impacts of human ­effluence plopping in front of us while we’re swimming. Maybe one measure they could look at is thatour beaches are to become toilets, we should ide them into gents and ladies beaches, with Torquay and Bournemouth being mixed so as not to discriminate against the trans community. I expect the water companies will say they’ve taken responsibility for the smell by chucking a couple of little blue things you get in public urinals into the North Sea. That should clear it up. Want the big political stories sent straight to your inbox for the Mirror Politics newsletter here The reason this is all possible is the priority of the water companies is not the outdated miserable business of providing water. Instead, they concentrate on the more exciting task of providing a profit for their shareholders. Since they were privatised, they’ve paid out £billion in profits, so with all that to think about, you can’t blame them for not having the time to stop poo bouncing into the sea. So we should be thrilled our water is in such safe hands. Because from the earliest of times, the planet has depended on one commodity above all , which is shareholders’ idends. And these companies are working selflessly, day and night, to keep this precious resource fresh and plentul. Water, on the other hand, doesn’t matter very much, so we might as well stick a million tons of poo into it and sling it into the sea.

Sixty-six soldiers from The Rles were killed in action in both wars while a further  were wounded, say official figures. And in the past four years at least  members of the infantry regiment have taken their own lives, according to Veterans United Against Suicide. One, Captain Gary Case, , is believed to have taken his own le in  just weeks after he received an MBE from the Queen. Warrant Officer Jim Wilde, one of the founders of VUAS, said: “The data recorded over the last four years reveals categorically that The Rles have a suicide rate far higher than any other unit. Have your say on this story in the comment section This is a direct consequence of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. “The Ministry of Defence should have done more to help veterans and serving members of the regiment.” General Sir Patrick Sanders, , one of the most senior commanders in the Army and a former Rles officer, revealed earlier this year that he had contemplated suicide after a violent tour and urged soldiers and veterans to get help.  He said: “I found myself obsessing about experiences, dwelling on photographs, video clips, letters, replaying in my mind what happened in a dark and obsessive way. “These thoughts took me to a dark place. When I caught myself at two in the morning with a bottle of wine or whisky next to me, I realised that I needed help.” The MoD said a “wealth of mental health and support” was available, while work is ongoing to gather data on trends. It added: “This will provide evidence to support further changes to prevention and intervention activity and the provision of post-event support.” Comment MORE ON British ArmyMinistry of DefenceJim WildeSoldiersArmed forcesMental healthIraqSunday PeopleSuicide\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Brenda Vickers, , decided to take action to fix her receding hairline and dwindling confidence, so visited hair replacement firm Novo Cabelo to get her mojo back. In a video shared on TikTok, Novo Cabelo owner Rob wood can be seen attaching a £ “hair system”, which is made with real hairs. When blindfolded Brenda sees the finished work she can’t help but tear up and ask: “Have I got all this hair ” More than , people have watched the footage, with many also finding it emotional and claiming her new appearance has made her look  years younger. Brenda, who suffers from coeliac, said the transformation would boost her confidence and enable her to visit the shops more often. The pensioner, from Walkergate, Newcastle upon Tyne, said: It feels good that I donapost have to be self-conscious when I go out. I donapost have to feel embarrassed anymore and think aposI donapost want to look at myselfapos.  Itaposs changed everything. Iaposll go out more now because I can feel confident and thataposs an unbelievable feeling. Everybody who Iaposve spoken to has been so complimentary and kind.“My head should be massive,” she told the Daily Star.People have been saying I look  years younger, but Iaposve still got the brain of a -year-old. My body is old but my hair is young. Iaposve not seen myself look like this for so long.” Brenda’s husband Brian, , was equally gobsmacked at the finished result of the hair system. Itaposs like being married to someone  years younger. Itaposs a good job Iaposve still got plenty of hair as well. [The transformation] is beautul, so Iaposm so pleased for her. Itaposs spot on. You couldnapost ask for anything better.  I really got a shock when I first saw her. I found her very attractive. Sheaposs not a bad looker, you know  The former admin worker believes her hair loss is due to the immune system disorder celiac, which she was diagnosed with in  but claims sheaposs been suffering from for  years. To achieve the new look, a stretchy ‘poly skin’ membrane was attached to her head with double-sided adhesive tape made especially for skin. It was fitted with existing hair and will last around six months.

People such as seven-year-old Harmonie-Rose Allen. Despite losing her arms and legs to meningitis she’s raised £, for charity by completing feats doctors said were impossible. People such as Rob Allen. He founded Sands United – a network of football teams where men can grieve together over children they have lost. People such as Gee Walker. She forgave her son’s killers and dedicated herself to promoting racial harmony. And people such as those on the Oxford-AstraZeneca team whose vaccine made this year’s Pride of Britain so dferent from the last.  Without them there would be no live audience to join in the tears and laughter or marvel at human stories, both heartwarming and heartbreaking. Their jab helped make near-normal le possible. The guest list for the evening is a Who’s Who of the famous – from Hollywood’s Sharon Stone to Stephen Fry, from TV’s Simon Cowell to Olympian Mo Farah. But they are there only as supporting actors for a cast of real people stepping into the limelight to showcase the very best of Britain. Our nation has suffered hugely over the last  months of the pandemic. But when the awards are televised on Thursday, everyone will have the chance to honour those who have endured much and achieved more than most of us do in a letime. It is a reminder that no matter how tough the challenges, the human spirit can find reserves of strength to overcome them. A reminder that after months of lockdown there is much out there to celebrate. And a reminder of the people of Britain of whom we can be most proud. No COPout Boris Johnson is usually Mr Optimism. So when he puts success at the COP climate change summit at little better than -, failure is clearly on the cards. The Prime Minister admits that the representatives of  nations are unlikely to reach agreement on how to keep global warming down to .C above pre-industrial levels. And key players President Xi of China and President Putin of Russia cannot even be bothering to turn up – although Xi is to address the summit by video link.  Yet their co-operation is neededclimate change is not to devastate the planet. So there is a danger that the crucial inter-national conference in Glasgow to curb the world’s hot air will end up with politicians just spouting it. But just because the , delegates are not going to hit their goal it does not mean they should not have a shot at the net. Firm commitments from world leaders who are there will take us a few more steps along the road to making our planet a safer place. And help pave the way for lasting success at the next summit.

Mr Fournier said: The captain of the Cornelis Gert Jan was given a summons by maritime police to appear at the hearing of the Criminal Court of Le Havre on August , . The prosecutor added: After verication, the captain of the vessel did not have the authorisation required to fish in the French exclusive economic zone.This was despite claims by the owners of the Cornelis that the boat had been fishing legally when it was detained on Wednesday night.Andrew Brown, director of Scottish firm MacDuff Shellfish, said she was being used as a apospawnapos by angry French ministers. Mr Brown said before news of the court action: MacDuffaposs fishing activity is entirely legal. We are looking to the UK government to defend the rights of the UK fishing fleet and ensure that the fishing rights provided under the Brexit fishing agreement are fully respected by the EU.On Friday morning, the Cornelis was still moored in Le Havre - still banned from leaving the port. The French ambassador has been summoned the Foreign Office in London later today to explain why the boat was detained. The crew of the Cornelis Gert Jan are still onboard as the legal battle rumbles on. It is moored up in a quiet area of the harbour with a sign saying “no unauthorised entry” on the gangplank. Boat owner Andrew Brown insisted they had all the right paperwork and the vessel should be allowed to leave as soon as possible. The boat had headed out from Shoreham, Sussex, early on Tuesday morning, and had expected to spend five days catching scallops in the English Channel.  Her seizure is the latest move by France in an ongoing row with the UK over who has rights to fishing grounds in the Channel now Britain has left the EU. The Cornelis’s haul has been thrown back overboard by the French, while her skipper spoke to an examining magistrate with the help of a French lawyer. Gendarmes on board the Athos – the police boat named after one of the Three Musketeers which detained the Cornelis– also fined a second, unidentied British boat on Wednesday. Her skipper was dealt with for initially refusing police permission to board, but then left toto the UK. Clement Beaune, Franceaposs Europe minister, has said we need to speak the language of force to Britain because it is the only thing this government understands. He was immediately accused of sabre rattling by British critics, as was Annick Girardin, the Maritime Minister in Paris, who said: It’s not war, but it is a fight. Referencing Brexit, Ms Girardin said: We are going to ask the European Commission to tell the United Kingdom that it is not respecting its agreement and therefore that retaliatory measures can be put in place. Before Brexit, French fishermen had free rights to fish in UK waters under EU law and only had to apply to their own government for a licence. But earlier this year the new Brexit Agreement came into force, meaning French fishermen now need to apply to the UK for a licence. All vessels that fished in UK waters aposfor at least four years between  and apos should be granted the same level of access until at least , when it will be up to the UK and France to negotiate new deals. The UK is asking French boats to provide tracking and fishing quota data for those years to qualy for a permit. The French have protested, saying smaller vessels under m do not collect this data and are being unfairly punished. The Brexit Agreement makes no mention of such data, they argue. British environment minister George Eustice told Parliament the seizure of the boat is being aposurgentlyapos looked into, but ruled out any apostit for tatapos retaliation. UK vessels with their licence to fish in EU waters should be allowed to do so uninterrupted, he said.

Yesterday French President Emmanuel Macron escalated the post-Brexit row raging between Paris and London when he questioned Britainaposs credibility and accused it of wanting to change parts of a treaty signed just last year over fishing rights and other topics. Speaking to the Financial Times, Macron said other nations were watching closely as Britain clashed with France and the broader European Union following its departure from the bloc.  Britain, looking to strike new trade deals after leaving the EU, had threatened to open trade dispute proceedings against FranceParis imposed sanctions on London. Such a step could seriously disrupt trade between the neighbours. Make no mistake, it is not just for the Europeans but all of their partners, Macron said. Because when you spend years negotiating a treaty and then a few months later you do the opposite of what was decided on the aspects that suit you the least, it is not a big sign of your credibility. Macron and Prime Minister Boris Johnson are due to meet briefly this weekend at the G meeting in Rome, offering a chance to ease tensions. On the flight from London, Johnson told reporters France was one of our best, oldest, closest allies, friends and partners, and that he would make that clear to Macron when they met.  Johnson added that he was puzzled by the fishing dispute and feared Paris may have breached terms of the Brexit trade deal. Obviously weaposre going to take the appropriate action, he added. Britainaposs departure from the EU last year deepened strains in its relations with France, and negotiations on fishing rights proved long and dficult even before it left the bloc. France says Britain has refused to grant its fishermen the full number of licences to operate in British waters that France says is warranted. Britain says it is issuing licences to vessels that can prove they have previously fished in UK waters. The Cornelis Gert Jan was escorted to the northern French port of Le Havre overnight on Wednesday after French officials said its crew failed to prove it was allowed to fish in French waters. British officials said it had the correct documentation. Angered by the incident, and by the threat of sanctions, British Environment Secretary George Eustice said on Friday: Two can play at that game.

But the movement – in a much more modest form – has been quietly growing in the UK too.What do you think of the apospreppersapos  Have your say in the comment section  Survival psychologist Dr Sarita Robinson, , began prepping after moving from Lancashire to Calornia’s San Andreas fault earthquake zone in the early s to work on her PhD. She says: “I was writing about earthquake survivors and preppers. What became clear was that those who prepped were better at surviving. “I realised I was living in quite a hazardous area and maybe I should have a quake survival kit.”  The habit stayed with her. Now teaching at the University of Central Lancashire in Preston, she still keeps a “go bag” in her car, with things such as waterproof clothes and first aid equipment. Her readiness served her well when Covid hit. Dr Robinson says: “I was talking to my boss as we were abandoning the university. “He said to me, ‘Sarita, we used to laugh at you – but we’re not laughing now…’”  As panic-buying kicked in, Dr Robinson did not need to buy food for three months, relying instead on stores she already had. She adds: “For a generation, we’ve had an absolute guarantee basic services will continue regardless. There’s this slow, dawning realisation that things can go wrong really quickly. “People were saying, ‘So it was you who was buying it all’, and I’d go, ‘No, I bought it a year ago when there wasn’t a problem!’”  Prepper Justin Jones saw the panic-buying as an opportunity to restart the survival business he had closed in . Justin, , says: “What sparked me off was the toilet paper fights in Tesco. Then they started the food rationing, where you could only have three packets of pasta per customer.” When he began selling survival gear such as crossbows and water filters through his UK Prepping Shop  months ago, orders flooded in – and have risen ten-fold since. One of his best-sellers is a six-month food kit costing £..  He says: “Years ago people laughed at preppers in the UK. Now they’re saying, ‘Actually, let’s just get a bit in case’, you know ” Lincoln Miles, , has seen a similar surge at his Newquay-based Preppers Shop UK in Cornwall. He has gone from having one member of staff to  to help him keep up with demand for military-grade gas masks and pre-packed “bug out bags” stocked with knives, mess tins and hammocks. Miles says: “If someone had a year’s worth of food, you’d think, ‘What a nutter’. That was always the perception, that preppers were on the outskirts of normality. That has definitely changed. I think people realise everyone’s got a bit ofprepper in them.”Michael ‘Roach’ Sanderson, , believes the idea behind prepping has been misunderstood. In  years in the military and  as a paramedic, he has seen how disasters can happen to anyone at any time. He says: “People talk about ­armageddon and the end of the world and make preppers sound like some ­religious cult. It’s not like that. Get the latest news direct to your inbox.to one of the Mirroraposs newsletters“They’re regular people with an eye and ear on what’s going on.” Michael’s YouTube channel, called “armouredcockroach”, covers skills such as making a splint for a broken bone or cooking a hot meal with no gas or ­electricity. On it he also shows off his array of gear – including his “bug out vehicle” – a Land Rover that contains everything he would need to survive in the wilderness.  When the pandemic first hit, Michael, his we and two children lived off a three-month supply of dehydrated food. He says: “We locked the door on the world because we had everything we needed. That’s it.” Dr Michael Mills, a lecturer in ­criminology at the University of Kent, has been studying prepping for the past decade. He says: “There’s always been a small subculture in the UK, but it started to gain popularity around the time of Brexit. “While in the US it’s mainly right-wing, British prepping is grounded more in liberal or centrist politics.”Dr Mills cites one Facebook group with , members, but says most people are “uncomfortable” about the idea of preppers.He adds: “We think like them a little, but want to keep them at arm’s . Otherwise, it means facing up to problems we’d rather not admit are as serious as they might seem.” essential items to keep in your stock- Tips from Sharyn McInally-Johnston from Prepper’s Paradise survival shop . First Aid Kit: A good stock of your regular medications, plus off-the-shelf staples such as paracetamol, ibuprofen, aspirin, antihistamines and dehydration powders, is a good start.. Torch: In a storm or disaster, power cuts are common and even familiar spaces can become dangerous..

The conference is being billed as the “last best hope” to stop global damage that threatens to wipe out coastal towns and cities and make critical areas of the planet uninhabitable. Last year the UK’s emissions total produced within the country was put at  million tonnes. But a probe has found that was overshadowed by the global output of  sponsors, understood to have poured millions of pounds each into the talks which open today in Glasgow. Just five – ScottishPower, Hitachi, Unilever, Reckitt and National Grid – recorded a combined carbon footprint of almost  million tonnes, matching % of the UK’s own total.  The damning figures were compiled by investigative website The Ferret, which is itself based in Glasgow. Former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas told the Sunday Mirror: “The Government is making hypocrisy the hallmark of its approach to the talks. “Far too many companies are talking up their environmental responsibility while in reality doing far too little. “They need to walk the talk and start implementing the policies needed to address an accelerating crisis.” The companies, described as “principal partners”, were all chosen by the UK Government – which is hosting the two-week climate summit. Officially called The  United Nations Climate Change Conference, it is the most signicant environmental summit since ’s Paris Agreement. Around , people will gather at the Scottish Event Campus . Among them are  heads of state – including US president Joe Biden, France’s Emmanuel Macron and ­Canada’s Justin Trudeau – as well as teen climate activist Greta Thunberg.The target is an international deal on climate goals, including net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by the middle of the century. A key aim is to prevent the global temperature from rising by more than .C. The  “principal partners” will be given signicant prominence at the event, staging  events of their own – giving a huge shop window to advertise themselves and to talk up their green credentials. The firms last night each issued statements defending their environmental record.  They insist they are all already making progress towards “ambitious” targets. And they warn that some emissions put down to them may have been double-counted, as direct and indirect emissions could overlap. The analysis broke down emissions into three categories. Scope One and Two cover those directly due to a firm’s operations, such as buildings, vehicles, electricity and heating. Scope Three are indirect, including goods and services it buys in, transportation, and use of its products.Spanish energy giant Iberdrola , parent company of ScottishPower, was the biggest polluter of the  – contributing more than . million tonnes. Despite ScottishPower boasting its portfolio is made up solely of renewable energy, Iberdrola has opened two fossil gas plants in Mexico since .And while it says % of its energy was from green sources in the first half of , it has faced criticism as Spain’s eighth biggest polluter – and causing water shortages in three towns.What do you make of this story  Join the debate in the comments below Japanese multinational Hitachi narrowly trailed Iberdrola with emissions of nearly . million tonnes. Third was Unilever , with more than  million tonnes. Research last year found the firm also produces , tonnes of plastic a year.But it has pledged to make all of its plastic packaging recyclable, reusable or compostable by , and cut all ties with palm-oil suppliers found to be responsible for Indonesian wildfires.Consumer goods firm Reckitt had emissions of nearly  million tonnes in . And it has been criticised for still using unsustainable palm oil.Reckitt claims  per cent of its  emissions were caused by use of its appliances in people’s homes.  And it claimed to have reduced the direct carbon footprint from its factories by  per cent since . National Grid ’s annual emissions narrowly trailed Reckitt, at just under  million tonnes. Its US operation has faced a backlash over plans to build a fracked gas storage and transport facility in New York.It says it is aiming for net-zero emissions by  and has achieved a % cut since . Lower emitters among the “principal partners” are Sainsbury’s, Glaxo­SmithKline, Microsoft, SSE, Sky and NatWest. Sainsbury’s did not publish a breakdown of indirect emissions for . Butthese remained the same as its - baseline figures, it would have topped  million tonnes.However, it is the only supermarket globally given the highest rating by the Climate Change Disclosure for taking action on climate change for seven consecutive years. It is also the retailer with the second-highest proportion of loose fruit and vegetables in Greenpeace rankings – and this week announced it was cutting five years from its target to become net zero, committing to  instead of . GlaxoSmithKline added nearly  million tonnes of emissions, while Microsoft produced more than  million tonnes. A partnership between Microsoft and oil giant ExxonMobil has been shown to risk an increase in its annual emissions by  per cent.The tech giant is also one of the biggest corporate buyers of flights despite running a video conferencing  – but says it is urging staff to use its Teams more and is launching a “focus on sustainability”. SSE emitted  million tonnes in , largely due to operating Peterhead power station.It says Peterhead is Scotland’s only major thermal power station and provides important system stability for the country’s electricity grid.  The firm says this lets more renewables projects go ahead, giving the plant a role in the energy transition.Broadcaster Sky produced more than two million tonnes, while the lowest of the  was NatWest – according to its sustainability report. However, the NatWest data appears not to take into account the emissions caused by its investment in fossil fuels projects to the tune of .billion between  and .NatWest funds are also linked to the Cerrejon coal mine in Colombia, one of the biggest in the world. Rebecca Newsom, Head of Politics at Greenpeace UK, said: “Companies must be put under much more pressure to align with the globally agreed goal to limit warming. “We need ambitious regulations without delay.

Carol said: “The night will be a proper celebration.” Here, we reveal some of this year’s inspirational winners...Letime Achievement – Rosemary Cox, , WolverhamptonSuccessfully campaigned to set up the first Organ Donor Register in the UK, helping to save thousands of lives. After their -year-old son Peter died in  following a brain tumour, Rosemary and John Cox saw the need for a register for people who wish to donate their organs. Peter had asked before his death for his organs to be used to help others and his sacrice saved or transformed the lives of  people. Have your say on this story in the comment section But his parents found that although patients in need of a transplant were listed on a central NHS computer, there was no equivalent register for potential donors. Over the next five years, the couple from Wolverhampton and their daughter Christine launched their campaign, travelling the country fundraising, lobbying politicians and creating awareness for their cause. Their efforts culminated at the  Conservative Party Conference when Christine made an impassioned plea from the  for a register of donorsapos wishes. Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley pledged there and then to set up an NHS Organ Donor Register, which launched on th October . Today the number of people who have registered their organ donation decision on the NHS Organ Donor Register has reached over  million or % of the UK population. Meanwhile, since the register was established on the th October , over , people have donated their organs after their death and over , deceased donor transplants have taken place. Rosemary is now . Her husband John passed away in , but their son’s legacy lives on and she continues to campaign to promote the benefits of organ transplantation. When the NHS marked the register’s th anniversary in , it was revealed it had saved or transformed , lives. And over the last  months, NHS Blood and Transplant facilitated nearly , transplants.Special Recognition – Rob Allen, , Northampton Founded Sands United, an inspirational network of football teams where men who have lost babies and young children can come together to grieve. Rob and his we Charlotte’s third child Niamh was stillborn, days before her due date in . They were helped through their loss by the stillbirth charity Sands, but at one meeting, Rob counted  women and three men. Realising that grieving dads were finding it dficult to reach out for help, he organised a charity football match to raise funds for Sands, but also giving men an opportunity to come together and talk about their loss. The one-off game, featuring bereaved fathers, grandfathers, uncles and brothers, raised £,, but the emotional benefit for the players was even more signicant.  And so, Sands United was born, and entered a local league in Northampton. But Rob’s impact has spread far wider. Inspired by his example, there are now more than  Sands United teams across Britain. Each team’s kit is embroidered with the names of the babies they have lost, and hundreds of men, and their families, have been empowered to open up about their loss, and support each other through sport.This Morning Emergency Services Award – Stephen Warton, , CumbriaPart-time firefighter risked his le to e to the rescue of a teenager who had been submerged in icy waters for more than  minutes.Kacper Krauze, , had been attempting to swim across the River Eden in Appleby-in-Westmorland in February . The weather was unseasonably warm, but the icy water sent his body into shock, and he sank to the bottom of the river. Appleby fire and rescue officers, who are retained with full-time jobs including butcher and mechanic, were the first emergency responders on the scene. Crew manager Stephen, a painter and decorator, and firefighter John Bell went into the river, supported by colleagues David Anderton, Michael Dowding, Bradley Hall, James Wood and Neil Aitken from the river bank. After a short search they located Kacper under two to three metres of water.

Paramedics resuscitated him and he was flown by air ambulance to hospital, where he was placed in an induced coma. He spent several weeks in intensive care but has since made a steady recovery.

But The Firm remained stalwart and continued with their royal duties in public as usual, attending events and showing their faces. On event saw Harry and Meghan reunite with The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for the first time in public since the bombshell announcement. The Commonwealth Day Service at Westminster Abbey, held shortly before lockdown on  March , was Harry and Meghanaposs final outing before they jetted off to LA.For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Sadly, it wasnapost quite the happy reunion weaposd hoped for and was reportedly marred by tensions behind the scenes. The pair had hoped to remain part of the Queenaposs procession at the beginning of the service. Instead, they were shown to their seats like all the other guests, which reportedly led them to be upset and emotional. However, the Daily Mail reports that, in a bid to smooth things over, Wills and Kate made a last minute change to the running order. The couple offered to skip the procession and join the Sussexes in their seats so they could all wait together for the service to start.  The decision was made so last minute that the order of services was already being printed - meaning they ended up being inaccurate. Sadly, itaposs reported their gesture didnapost have the desired effect and the meeting of the two couples appeared somewhat awkward. The Sussexes arrived first and sat in the second row. The Cambridges were shortly behind them, but Meghan and Harry didnapost stand to greet them. During the  ceremony Meghan and Kate greeted each other with a kiss on each cheek, but they seemed more reserved at this event. While it wouldnapost have been possible for them to kiss, the two couples exchanged only one or two words as they waited for the Queen and Prince Charles to arrive.  Meghan, who was already sitting down, could be seen saying hello and giving an awkward wave. Harry also said hello, but that was as far as their conversation went, with Harry turning to talk to his we. Then Sophie Wessex, who was sat behind Kate, leaned forward to chat to the Duchess while Harry and Meghan spoke to Prince Edward. There had been rumours of a rt between the two couples in the months leading up to Meghan and Harry announcing their intention to step down. These were fuelled when the couple scrapped their plans to live at Kensington Palace, just a few doors down from the Cambridges, and moved to Windsor instead. William and his dad Prince Charles were reportedly incandescent with rage when they were sent their announcement just  minutes before it was shared with the world.

New book VanLers shows how people have created incredible campers on a budget, transforming fire trucks, horseboxes and even ambulances. Here, we meet a few van le converts.Have you given everything up for a le on the road  Email webnews@mirror It took two months for Mark Bonito and Sophie Why to transform an old ambulance destined for the scrap heap. The couple were already living in a campervan part-time when they bought the Fiat Ducato at auction with all of its le-saving kit still inside. The couple, from Surrey, spent £, turning the ambulance into their new home – and called it Florence, after hero nurse Florence Nightingale. Sophie, , who works as a radiographer, says: “When it arrived, the inside was a treasure trove.  Everything was still in place – the stretcher, fold-away seats… even the cupboards with labels indicating what had previously lived in each one. “My personal favourites were the cupboards labelled ‘vomit bowl’ and ‘body bag’. “We are regularly asked whether the van is haunted or told how disgusting it is because of the nature of what happens in the back of an ambulance. “But we prefer to see the positive side of it and remind people of the number of iniduals our ambulance has helped to save, racing along, lights flashing, sirens blaring.”  Artist Tasha Bee, , converted her van into a mobile pottery studio, allowing her to put on workshops across the country. The van, called Daphne, is the third to be renovated by creative Tasha but her first fully converted vehicle. Tasha says: “I had quite a clear aesthetic vision for this project and have loved the process of bringing it into reality. I’ve learned a lot along the way. There are still quite a few bits and pieces that I want to do as well, so it’s an ongoing project.” Tasha, who is based in Bristol, set up a Crowdfunder campaign to raise funds for her portable business, called Pot Heads Pottery. Her target was £, and she raised slightly more than that, allowing her to install an electrical system in the van, which comes complete with an s-inspired theme. “I think the most unique thing about Daphne is her colourful paint job,” Tasha says. “I sometimes forget when I’m driving around in her and wonder why people are looking at me with a funny smile on their faces – then I remember that I’m in a big flowery van!”  Former lorry driver Charlie Glover was living in his nan’s spare room when he bought his “faded and rusty” truck for £, back in . The -year-old gradually kitted out the vehicle by skip-ing, upcycling and getting hand-me-downs from friends. Its sound system is salvaged from a nightclub, fresh water is stored in beer kegs and the kitchen is made from pallets. Charlie, of Cheltenham, Glos, who now runs his own van conversion company called RanVanga, says: “At the start, it definitely wasn’t comfortable. It was cold and had no heating, toilet or shower, but I loved the process. “Some nights were awful, but when the sun shines and you remember you’re making your own home, it makes it all worthwhile.”  RAF veteran Dr Sophie Cook, , traded her two-bed flat for a -year-old horsebox after struggling to pay her rent during lockdown. After years of dreaming about le on the road, she snapped up her  Ford Cargo Horsebox for £,. And Sophie, who was known as Steve until , affectionately named her horsebox Betty Blue. Since moving in, Sophie has mucked out the van to create a cosy mobile home and replaced bench seating with a sofa bed in the lounge area. Sophie, the former club photographer at AFC Bournemouth, says: “I love to roam. One day soon I hope to cross the sea and travel.”  Jess and Dave Branton always wanted to convert their own vehicle, so when they saw an advert for a fire truck nearby, it was impossible to resist. The van was delivered to their drive the very next day and the couple spent £, converting it into their dream mobile home, complete with shower room, composting loo, gas cylinder, log burner and solar-powered system. Jess, , and Dave, , then took the plunge and put their house on the market in order to live in the fire truck full-time with their daughters Poppy, , and five-year-old Luna. At first, the family stayed close to friends and family in Lincoln, but they have since clocked up more than , miles travelling through Europe. Jess says: “At first we quietly resided in woodland and enjoyed true off-grid van le, homeschooling and rewilding with nature. “The future for the fire truck family is exciting – lots more travelling and living freely.”VanLers: Beautul Conversions for Le on the Road, edited by Alex Waite, is published by The History Press, RRP £.Comment MORE ON Staycation\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Harry and Meghan met in  and tied the knot in May  - two years before leaving royal le.In a  interview, Meghan - who was still an actress in Suits at the time - made some comments that somehow seemed to foreshadow her and Harryaposs future decision to become independent, the Daily Star reports. She told InStyle: I think the biggest part of being a girl boss in the office, at home, or anywhere you go is just knowing your value. As you get older, you become more comfortable in your skin and comfortable in saying aposnoapos to things...Itaposs something that, I think, comes with age and really having a sense of your self-worth. And then you make choices based on that. During an interview Harry and Meghan gave in  while on a trip in South Africa, the Duchess of Sussex admitted she was not okay. She made the admission in a chat with ITVaposs Tom Bradby about the pressures of her new role as a royal mum, appearing to hold back tears.  Meghan was asked about the true pressures of le in the spotlight and the toll it has taken on them both.She said at the time:Look, any woman especially when they are pregnant you’re really vulnerable and so that was made really challenging, and then when you have a newborn – you know.And especially as a woman, it’s a lot. So you add this on top of just trying to be a new mom or trying to be a newlywed it’s, well... She then thanked Tom for asking how she felt, saying: And, also thank you for asking, because not many people have askedI’m OK. But it’s a very real thing to be going through behind the scenes.  The comments seem to suggest that the possibility of leaving the Royal Family was on their minds for some time before they announced they would step down. This year Harry, , also admitted that he had thought about quitting the Firm in his twenties. He told actor Dax Shepard on the Armchair Expert podcast: In my early s, it was a case of, aposI donapost want this job, I donapost want to be here, I donapost want to be doing this, look what it did to my mumapos. In a statement released on social media in January  to announce their decision of quitting royal le, the Sussexes said: After many months of reflection and internal discussions, we have chosen to make a transition this year in starting to carve out a progressive new role within this institution.  We intend to step back as ‘senior’ members of the Royal Family and work to become financially independent, while continuing to fully support Her Majesty The Queen. It is with your encouragement, particularly over the last few years, that we feel prepared to make this adjustment. We now plan to balance our time between the United Kingdom and North America, continuing to honour our duty to The Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages. The couple went on to discuss Archie and their plans to raise him with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born. They said: This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity. We look forward to sharing the full details of this exciting next step in due course, as we continue to collaborate with Her Majesty The Queen, The Prince of Wales, The Duke of Cambridge and all relevant parties. Until then, please accept our deepest thanks for your continued support.

And both of them were struggling emotionally and mentally to cope with, first of all, being pregnant, but also with le inside this goldfish bowl of the Royal Family. The royal biographer added that one of the biggest misconceptions about Meghan is that she was in control of their lives while they were senior royals, but actually, Prince Harry was the real expert.He explained:Meghan Markle is blamed for Harry coming to Hollywood. When ironically, it was Harry who was very keen to do an interview with Oprah. Mr Morton added: So she has deferred to him and often got the blame for things that have gone wrong. Sadly for Meghan, thereaposs a narrative thataposs built up thataposs wholly negative towards her.Last month, Meghan paid a subtle tribute to Princess Diana as she rounded off a trip to New York City with Harry.She carried a black Christian Dior Lady D-Lite bag that Diana liked and also wore her Cartier Tank watch. In her book aposThe Benchapos, which was published in June this year, Meghan also paid tribute to Diana with a picture of her favourite flowers.Meghan told NPR : “I think you can find sweet little moments that we hid in there – of my favourite flower, even my husband’s mom’s favourite flower, forget-me-nots.“We wanted to make sure those were included in there.

Beckie Searle, from Birmingham, is currently living in private rented accommodation but must leave by November .She cannot afford to continue private renting and has been told it could take months for her to find a council home, BirminghamLive reports.Birmingham City Council said there is a shortage of properties in the city and it is encouraging residents to look at the private market. Single mum Beckie, , has four children, Tyler aged , Jodie, aged , eight-year-old Kaine and five-year-old Leyla. Kaine is autistic and the strain on the family is having a particularly negative affect on him.  Jodie suffers from bronchitis and Leyla has mobility problems. Beckie has contacted Birmingham City Council for help but has been told she could face months to find a new home. The mum says private renting is too expensive and now faces splitting her young family up - a decision which she says will break her heart. The family have already packed up their belongings and are just counting the days until they have to leave their home. Beckie, who is currently claiming Universal Credit but is looking to go back to work as a support worker, said: The family will be split up as I will have to put them all up at dferent houses within our family. I need my autistic son settled.He is getting more aggressive than he usually is because of the situation. He doesnapost like to leave his bedroom because he doesnapost knowthat will be the last time he will see it. Two of my other children also have health problems. I have gone through the homeless department at the council but have told me that I have to wait six weeks before I get a bidding number to bid for a house. They have told me to private rent. I just canapost afford the prices. I canapost afford £ per month for a four bedroomed house. My wages would just not cover it.  Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter I feel absolutely wounded by whataposs happened. Itaposs just going to be a massive upheaval for everyone. A spokesman for Birmingham City Council said: We are very sorry to hear that this family is being made homeless. Anyone being asked to leave a rented property should seek legal advice on what this means in terms of the circumstances under which they may need to leave. This can sought from a housing law solicitor or through Birmingham City Council’s Housing Solutions service. If a household is at risk of homelessness the Housing Solutions service will assess the circumstances and determine in what way they may be assisted.  Demand for housing in Birmingham is considerably greater than supply, this does regularly result in households who are homeless, being placed in emergency accommodation including BB’s, until a alternative option can be secured. We do encourage households to look at other options. To help with renting in the Private Rented Sector we have introduced a new scheme with HelpRent, an organisation that makes housing simple for tenants and landlords and provides incentives to landlords who offer -month fixed tenancies to those on the Council’s homeless and housing registers.

What do you think of the house  Have your say in the comment section “I wanted to recreate that vibe within my home to match how I dress every day. “I found that, during lockdown, decorating was a great way to stay positive, it started with one room and just progressed from there.” Thrty Lizzie raided charity shops and upcycled old furniture to give her home its vintage vibe. She said: “I really tried to stick to a budget, so a lot of furniture and accessories are from charity shops and I also upcycled a lot of furniture and even reupholstered this old chair I had.  “I aimed to spend less than £ a month and I’ve tried to decorate the house with little bits that I love. “I also inherited lots of homeware from my late grandma, which really fits with the look I was aiming for. “I wanted to create a bit of escapism, and I haven’t left a wall untouched. “I’ve been shopping vintage for the past fteen years, and because I’m a bargain queen, I love to raid the £ or fewer rails.

Lewis Felstead, one of the directors of e-liquids, set up a series of security cameras and couldnapost believe what he saw on Monday morning this week. Lewis said: We were putting a new office in upstairs and discovered this space down here. The builders didnapost almost want to be in here to explore because they were hearing strange noises.  When they came down here they would often come straight back up so with that we werenapost sure what was going on. We needed to know what was happening with the building and thataposs when we put in the expensive cameras. We found that things were moving on their own, including this door. It sends a shiver down my spine being stuck here in this spaceIaposm honest.  When you come down here you can feel the atmosphere change in this space. One of our female colleagues was one of the first to come down here to have a look, but one of the first to run back up and to let everyone know what the experience was like. That was part of the trigger for looking to investigate further.

Scientists have tipped tonight - the day before Halloween - to be a magical one thanks to solar flares.A huge burst of radiation from the sun on October  is due to reach the Earth tonight after a  million mile journey. The cloud of electromagnetic particles will cause a colourful display in the atmosphere which may be visible from parts of the Northern Hemisphere.If you see the Northern Lights tonight, send your photos to webnews@mirror The best vantage points will fall across Iceland, Scotland, Norway, Alaska, Canada and Michigan in the US, C Alex Young, NASAaposs Heliophysics Division associate director at the Goddard Space Flight Centre in Maryland, said. The best chance of seeing the phenomenon will be around am, when it is usually the darkest.Luckily the Met Office has forecasted that there will be little to no cloud cover tonight, meaning the view wonapost be blocked.The Northern Lights tend to shine brightest the further north you are, meaning those in the south of England probably wonapost get much of a display.  This is primarily because the planetaposs poles conduct the most electromagnetic energy. The solar discharge could impact some of the planetaposs orbiting satellite arrays, meaning some mobile devices may stop working temporarily. When the Sun first loosed its latest flare, it caused a near-immediate impact in South America. Most of the continent, at the time facing the star, briefly lost radio capabilities.  Solar flares are ided into categories according to their strength and the one that was fired off on Thursday was an X-class. They are classied in a letter system, with C-class being relatively weak, M-class moderate and X-class flares as the strongest. Among X-class ones, “an X is twice as intense as an X, an X is three times as intense”, according to NASA. The one currently headed towards Earth is an X flare which, despite being the least intense of the X-class flares, is likely wreak havoc by interfering with radio and satellite communications.

The monarch is said to be “totally committed” to entertaining her loved ones at her Norfolk home after missing out last year because of the pandemic. On Friday it was revealed Her Majesty, , has cancelled all working visits for the next two weeks and has been advised to stick to “light, desk-based duties”. It means several of her royal engagements have been cancelled, including the COP climate change conference which starts in Glasgow today. The Queen, who has recently used a walking stick for the first time on royal visits, is recovering after she had tests and spent a night in hospital earlier this month. But royal sources said she is determined to recover soon so she can see her family at their traditional festive gathering. Last year restrictions meant the Queen and the late Prince Philip had a quiet Christmas alone at Windsor Castle.But after losing her husband of  years in April, it is understood Her Majesty really wants to see everyone together. A Palace insider said: “This year, more than ever, it is incredibly important to Her Majesty to be surrounded by her loved ones. “The Queen is totally committed to hosting everyone as she hopes to make it back to full health in the coming weeks. “Her Majesty is resting under doctors’ orders with the intention of being able to fully enjoy the company of her extended family over the holiday period.  “After being forced to cancel a host of engagements, the family get-together will be the perfect tonic.” Royal aides insist the Queen is in “good spirits” and stress her medical team is simply taking “sensible precautions” with its latest advice.

Like ghostly apparitions, rising from the deep, they appear only occasionally to spook passers-by on Anglesey’s northern coast. For much of the time the cluster of figures remain submerged beneath the Irish Sea, only to reappear like maritime Chewbaccas or the Crew of the Flying Dutchman. Now that Halloween is approaching, the human-like shapes at Newry Beach, Holyhead, have gained wider fascination on social media. Locals have been aware of the phenomenon for some time and been mildly disturbed by them but a new picture of the marine ghouls have brought them to a larger audience. One person told NorthWales Live they do a double-take every time they walk past the eerie group.Another said: “I wouldn’t like to see them on a dark evening, very spooky.” A third added: “Actually that’s quite scary.... especiallyseen in the moonlight.” The photo was taken by Craig Fairclough of Chester, a regular visitor to the area in his touring caravan.He told North Wales Live : “I was walking the dog along Newry Beach when I saw what looked like human bodies emerging from the water,” he said.“I thought it would make a good photo, so I grabbed my mobile phone.“It was a spur of the moment thing. After the picture was posted on Facebook, it was shared widely with people saying how unique and atmospheric it looked.”The aposghoulsapos are in fact a seaweed-covered cluster of old wooden pilings from Holyhead’s former leboat ramp.Nature has fashioned them into human shapes that now stand testimony to the bravery of leboat crews who have operated out of Holyhead since .

Lancaster University graduate Polly Sutherland was  when she was spiked five years ago, but says she still feels vulnerable going out all these years later. Miss Sutherland, from Stone in Staffordshire, had been on a night out at the universityaposs The Sugarhouse, run by the studentsapos union, in December  when friends noticed her behaving strangely. The graduate, who also has type  diabetes, said being drugged left her needing to use a walking stick for around a month because it damaged her blood sugar levels - something which can be fatal for people with the condition.  It took away the use of her drawing hand for weeks. Recalling the night, Miss Sutherland, now , said: I donapost remember anything suspicious happening, or noticing anything happening. It was just, later in the night, friends with me noticed that my personality changed - I seemed very dferent... erratic. So they took me home, I went to bed, but when I woke up in the morning I had a lot of bodily weakness and twitches in my arms, legs, all over really. She went on: When I went tothey werenapost very helpful. I remember feeling really disappointed, because I went to them saying aposFrom whataposs going on, I think Iaposve been spikedapos.  They almost raised their eyebrows, almost accusing me of taking drugs, and I was trying to get out of it somehow or making excuses. I felt very let down by the doctors at that point. Miss Sutherland had to apply for deadline extensions in the final year of her art degree because she could not paint or draw following the incident. She said she reported the incident to Lancaster University Studentsapos Union , but received little response. Asked how the incident made her feel, she said: Very... I donapost want to use the word violated, because maybe thataposs too strong. But itaposs scary to think what could have happened. Iaposm lucky that I had a lot of friends around me that took me home when they noticed something wasnapost right, so Iaposm very thankful for that, because I donapost know what purpose that person went out with.  It made me feel very vulnerable. Even now, when I go on nights out, Iaposm very cautious of it now, and itaposs in the back of my mind all the time. The graduate, who is now in her second year of a politics degree at Keele University, said she has joined the Girls Night In movement, which sees students boycotting clubs following reports of drink spiking incidents. But she said: The thing that bothers me is that, with the boycotting, the onus is on girls, again, to stay in. I think the fact that we are the ones that have to stay in because this is happening is putting it on us, itaposs our responsibility to make sure we donapost get spiked, instead of telling people not to spike people. Miss Sutherland said clubs should use CCTV and scan ID cards on entry, instead of just checking them by eye, so that they have a record of who attended each night. In a statement, Lancaster University said: We pride ourselves on Lancaster being a safe place to study and are distressed to hear about any of our students being assaulted in this way. The Sugarhouse is owned and managed by Lancaster University Studentsapos Union, and we cannot comment on inidual incidents. However,any of our students have safety concerns in relation to spiking, or any other kind of assaults, then we would strongly encourage them to report them to the university and we have created a range of ways to enable our students to do so. We would also encourage students to report any such incidents to the police.

Preston Mark Middleton was diagnosed with Spina Bida, a condition which causes a babyaposs spine and spinal cord to develop improperly in the womb.Doctors scanned mum Deborah and told her the unborn child had birth defect which can cause weakness or total paralysis of the legs, Chronicle Live reported. It also caused Chiari  malformation - a condition of the cerebellum that can put pressure on parts of the brain and spinal cord. In a bid to give Preston his best chance, Deborah underwent fetal surgery in Belgium when she was  weeks pregnant to repair his spine. And then at  weeks, Preston entered the world via a C-section. Get all the latest news sent to your inbox.for the free Mirror newsletter He remained in intensive care while doctors monitored his progress before he was allowed tohome on December . The diagnosis came as a huge shock to Deborah and -year-old dad David, . Deborah said: When we got the diagnosis, they gave us quite a bleak outlook of children with Spina Bida. I was told Preston would not have a very good quality of le, he would not be able to do much for himself like walk and run. I know they have to give you the worst-case scenarios but we just found out our baby had got a condition, it was really dficult. They said we had a few options, the first option was a termination which was just horrendous.  Deborah said the family has been on a rollercoaster of emotions since Prestonaposs diagnosis but that the little boy is doing amazingly well. She said: It all happened in the middle of the pandemic, it feels a bit like a dream from getting the diagnosis to how he is now, heaposs doing amazing. Itaposs been a rollercoaster of emotions. Itaposs so hard because you donapost know whataposs going to happen or how he is going to do or what his le will be like. We were trying for two years before I became pregnant with Preston and itaposs supposed to be such a happy time but I was just so worried and stressed. You get to the point where you just accept the situation and deal with whatever comes next. We just told ourselves weaposre lucky heaposs been sent to us, heaposs extra special. As well as the emotional toll, Deborah also had a scare following the surgery after losing the use of her legs but luckily an emergency MRI scan revealed no long-term damage. She said: I couldnapost walk and had to use a wheelchair to get around. I went through surgery to give my son the best chance of walking and now I couldnapost walk. It was a really scary time but I was doing it for Preston so it was all worth it. Now, -months-old, Preston is doing amazingly well despite his condition and is already trying to crawl. Deborah said: We went for his first physio session and they were just blown away by him, heaposs just like a typical child.  Heaposs met all his milestones up to now. Walking is not something we are going to know about until it happens. Heaposs been doing amazingly well, heaposs been trying to crawl around, and seeing as heaposs been doing so well they do think he will walk. Heaposs the happiest little boy in the world, you would never think he had been through everything he has. In his  months heaposs been through more than some people have their whole letime but heaposs still the happiest little boy and he makes us all so proud every day. Deborah and her partner had to make the call about whether to go ahead with fetal surgery, which can be very risky. Since the procedure was such a success, the new mum wants to spread the word. She said: We want people to know a termination is not their only option because weaposve spoken to people and some didnapost even know it was an option. When youaposre given a diagnosis like this, you donapost know what to do. With us sharing Prestonaposs story we hope people will read it and feel hope. If we can help just one person who is going through the same thing who is maybe not sure what to do or whether they should have a termination then that would be amazing. They say itaposs a snowflake condition- it affects every child dferently so no one knows what is going to happen. Deborah added: Heaposs our little superhero, we couldnapost be prouder. Heaposs shown us what true bravery, courage, and determination is. Most people never meet their hero but we are raising ours. Heaposs such an inspiration.

Katie Murphy, , attacked the man, Joseph Walker, as he was out for drinks with friends at the busy Masquerade bar in Liverpool.The glass narrowly missed Mr Walkeraposs right eye but he was left with signicant injuries which will leave him permanently scarred, the Liverpool Echo reported.Murphy of Stonyfield, Netherton, previously admitted she was off her face after a cocaine and alcohol binge which started the night before the attack on the evening of October  last year. She appeared at Liverpool Crown Court for sentencing on Friday after pleading guilty to causing grievous bodily harm without intent.  CCTV showed Mr Walker chatting and drinking with friends at the bar in the moments leading up to the sickening attack. Suddenly, while Mr Walker is looking down at his phone, he is approached by Murphy, who swilled a drink at him and smashed the glass in his face. She then blew two kisses at the victim before walking outside. Chris Hopkins, prosecuting, said: Mr Walker described a hand appearing with a glass which was thrust into his face. The glass broke with the impact. He bled profusely and was left with a jagged wound. He was taken to hospital and needed four internal stitches and  external stitches above his right eye. In his victim statement, Mr Walker said he now has a visible scar to his forehead, and he had become conscious of the way he looked. He added: I had a bubbly, happy nature before this happened, but I am now more nervous around people. I still donapost know why it was me she did it to. Maybe it was mistaken identity, maybe she just didnapost like the look of me. The injury was very close to my eye and it could have been a lot worse. Mr Walker bravely said he had forgiven his attacker. Mike Hagerty, defending, said Murphy accepted the victim of her attack was wholly innocent. He added: The defendant has a signicant mental health problem, including a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, which is exacerbated by the use of drugs and alcohol. She has expressed regret and is remorseful. Judge Recorder Richard Leiper QC sentenced Murphy to  weeks in prison, suspended for  months.

We will see somewhere in the region of  world leaders in Glasgow next month for the COP climate change conference, and that will occupy the front pages for its duration.However, itrsquos clear that the scale of action needed in the face of catastrophic climate change requires strong collective leadership at every level. Where better to begin than education to relay the message of how urgently our behaviours need to change.With that in mind, Scotlandrsquos colleges are providing leadership on a strong collective front. Not only do they need to be the messengers, but they also need to pay attention to the message, with shts in their own working models and practices.Many colleges in Scotland have been working on this steadily. Following the Paris agreement at COP in , colleges have been making good progress in reducing carbon emissions. In fact, since reporting began in  . The sector has achieved an overall % reduction in emissions. This is better progress than the whole of the public sector, which has reduced by % over the same period.Clearly % is impressive but there is work to be done towards achieving the Scottish Government reporting expectations, and the sectorrsquos own statement of commitment, to achieve Net Zero climate emissions by  or earlier.Bringing together the current thinking and setting out a joint agenda, College Development Networkrsquos Climate Emergency Expert Group hosted the inaugural College Climate Change Conference, earlier this month.Held online with representatives of the college expert group and partners, it gave a strategic overview of the climate change actions that the college sector should be engaged in.It follows the development of the Scottish Colleges Statement on the Climate Emergency, which lists  key actions that colleges have committed to delivering.ldquoThe college sectorrsquos role in this is going to be huge, says Jim Metcalfe, Chief Executive of College Development Network . ldquoWe have a role to make sure that our own institutions, campuses, and staff and student travel is Net Zero. We have a role to provide the skills to ensure the economy can reform itself to be Net Zero ndash how we teach and train and develop people. And we have a role in how to influence change in our communities ndash we are crucial anchor institutions across the country that can influence the way our regional economies can change for the better.Skills development is something that is absolutely crucial in the contribution of colleges. The vocational courses that many offer, those that have an impact on our everyday lives will clearly need to change in line with green technologies as well as manufacturing and building practices.ldquoTo achieve Net Zero wersquoll need new green jobs, which in turn means wersquoll need to ensure we have people with the right skills to take up those jobs, says Dr Mike Cantlay OBE, Chair of the Scottish Funding Council.Providing an idea of scale, at the conference he pointed out that one change, the sht to electric vehicles, will require , people to be trained or retrained to support the new technology.ldquoThat means we have huge reskilling and upskilling tasks ahead of us. Through initiatives such as the National Transition Training Fund, colleges are already providing great opportunities for reskilling and upskilling ndash and these examples demonstrate the responsive-ness and agility of the college sector. But our success will rely on our ability to inspire future learners to consider these new career options, and I commend the work of colleges in this crucial task.Its clear that colleges are playing a crucial part in our rapidly changing landscape and as Angela Cox, Principal and CEO of Borders College, explained at the conference, colleges, perhaps more than ever are acting as catalysts of change.Also a lead Principal on the Climate Emergency within the College Principals Group, Angela Cox details some of the changes happening at Borders College.ldquoAll students at Borders college will complete a carbon literacy module at the start of their programme but this is only a small part of their development, she explains. ldquoHowever, that needs to be brought to le in their subject learning. A small but good example is a project with Bordersrsquo hairdressing students looking at the choice of dye products ndash synthetic versus organic and what happens when the waste product including peroxide is rinsed and flows into the water system.Angela Cox points to projects that are initiated by students, and through creating employer partnerships are also powerful catalysts for change. An example is a former Borders College plumbing student who invented a device to stop water leaks immediately while the fault was found. His company Kibosh now operates globally.She says, ldquoWe are also sharing our carbon literacy module with our schools and housing associations and supporting the delivery through a train the trainer approach. Over time this means that students progressing to the college already have the basics and our projects become more innovative and collaborative through our community partnerships.Angela Cox adds, ldquoColleges are in a unique and privileged position to take a leading role in achieving Net Zero. We have the power to influence the behaviours and values of our students, staff and communities. I am proud that Borders College is seizing the opportunity to help secure a sustainable future for the Scottish Borders and beyond.College staff and students have spent a considerable amount of time creating this new culture for colleges, where the consideration of climate impact isnrsquot a tick box but goes to the heart of everything they do.In November  Dundee and Angus College was invited to take part in the pilot of the College Learning for Sustainability Champions course, run by EAUC and Learning for Sustainability Scotland.Christine Calder, Academic Development Lead at the College explained at the conference how important it was for Dundee and Angus to be involved.ldquoOne lecturer from each of our  curricular departments attended the course. This gave us a real opportunity to know who a friend of sustainability was in each department.  lecturers, working with an average of  students. Thatrsquos  people directly affected. Thenwe add in the conversations that have happened in those studentsrsquo homes and with friends or the conversations that the lecturers had within their departments let alone their friends and families as well as students in other classes. Thatrsquos the ripple effect.Dr Katie Paget, Science Lecturer and Learning and Teaching Skills Mentor at Dundee and Angus College was one of the lecturers who was part of the pilot for the science team. She says, ldquoIn many ways the pandemic has brought the themes within the UNrsquos Sustainable Development Goalsinto the limelight, and this gives us a powerful opportunity.ldquoThis academic year we have embedded the SDGs into our Lecturer Professionalism Pathway. Within the course lecturers can reflect on, and share ways that they can embed such themes within their teaching and have the opportunity to try out ideas in a supportive environment.ldquoOur hope is that by weaving these into our curriculum with new lecturers during their early career, linking SDGs in their classrooms can become a foundation within their teaching, and not an extra.Its clear that the sector has put time and effort into creating a climate change strategy with clear goals and is working with a greater shared purpose than ever before.ldquoThe sector is now focused on operationalising those actions and achieving against that statement of commitment, on campuses and in teaching across the country as a sector, adds Jim Metcalfe, Chief Executive of CDN. ldquoIrsquom hopeful and aspirational about this agenda. ____________________________________________________________________Roadmap outlines path towards Net Zero futureWORKING towards the same ends takes collective knowledge and purpose. To that end a Climate Action Roadmap for colleges has been developed by the Climate Commission for UK Higher and Further Education, to support colleges at all stages of their progress towards Net Zero.The roadmap was developed closely with college leaders, students, and partners to ensure that it was relevant to every college, no matter what stage it hasreached on its sustainability journey.Itrsquos a tool that can be a useful gap analysis, to show where you are doing well, but identy where improvements are required. The roadmap alsofactors in cost and time commitments for each action, which helps in that planning.It covers all areas of the college, so you look at distinct areas in detail, such as leadership and governance, teaching and learning, estates and partnerships, and engagement.The Climate Action Roadmap illustrates clearly what an emerging college could look like. It helps colleges to tailor actions to match strategy. This is seen as an opportunity, in advance of COP to show how Scottish colleges are leading the way on climate change.From the date that every college commits to the roadmap, it has a full year to develop targets and show how those will be implemented.Workshops to develop the roadmap were carried out in June, attended by staff, and partners of Scotlandrsquos colleges. Billy Currie, Head of Corporate Services at Dumfries  Galloway College attended those workshops and says he could identy benefits for reviewing climate change plans immediately.Some colleges across the sector havebeen working in this area this since . Billy believes that one of the roadmaprsquos great strengths is its flexibility, where it can strengthen and consolidate the work that has already been done.At the College Climate Change Conference he explained, ldquoAt Dumfries  Galloway we carried out something of a progress review. We have used the Colleges get to work on key climate actions roadmap to reflect on our previous climate change action plan, to see where we could identy successes.ldquoWe could identy elements such as using renewable technologies in new builds, looking at our electric fleet vehicles, and identying partners for our student transport. We also have an established waste network with zerowaste goals for going to landfill.Billy Currie adds that an area that they could strengthen was governance. ldquoWe had already taken steps at Dumfries  Galloway in terms of setting our targets and annual reporting, both to the board and the cross-college Climate Action Group.ldquoBy using the roadmap we were able to declare a climate emergency, signed by the Principal, the Board Chair, and the Studentsrsquo Association President. ldquoThe declaration document commits the college to taking continued action on climate change matters. ldquoClimate change is now embedded into our systems and infrastructure strategies. We also have key performance indicators measuring what wersquore doing year on year ndash these are monitored by the Board, senior leadership and the climate action group.Billy Currie adds that working on awareness among staff and students, particularly in subject areas, is crucial to achieving the sustainable development goals.ldquoClimate change action is embedded at Dumfries  Galloway College, and we now have a revised plan, which is more focused because of the roadmap. As well as identying the key areas where we need to make changes, we can look at not only the college itself but how we fit in to the wider plan, regionally and nationally."},{"url":null,"title":"eyemouth-man-involved-two-domestic-bust-ups-borders","story":"A MAN involved in two domestic bust-ups within the space of a month has been ordered to carry out  hours of unpaid work at Jedburgh Sherf Court.Aleksandrs Kravcovs, , was abusive to the woman at a party in Eyemouth on Christmas Eve and then followed it up by assaulting her a month later.Describing the first incident Depute fiscal Alison Atkins said: \"The accused attended at the locus with a number of people on the evening of Christmas Eve.\"People were consuming alcohol and in good spirits.\"However as the evening progressed the accused became aggressive and wanted to go home and take his young daughter with him.:lsquoMajor incidentrsquo stood down but number of roads still lsquoaffectedrsquo by flooding\"A witness and his partner both said this was not a good idea due to his level of intoxication.\"This caused the accused to become even more aggressive and was shouting and swearing in an aggressive manner.\"He was prevented from entering the daughters bedroom and the police were contacted.\"In January the fish processing factory worker got involved in another argument with his partner which escalated and resulted in him slapping her face and seizing hold of her by her arms.Ms Atkins said: \"She was knocked to the ground.

expect.\"It was absolutely beautul and I didnt expect to see my name on the entry to the town.\"But as well as enjoying the sunshine and the sights the area has to offer, Melrose had another reason to visit the town bearing her name ndash its connections with her ancestry.Dr Stewart added: \"Id spoken to Sir Geoff Palmer [OBE, chancellor at Heriot-Watt University and human rights activist] ndash who is doing a lot of work in Scotland around the slave trade and the history of Jamaica and its connections with the slave trade. Id spoken with him a few times and he said Melrose has connections in Jamaica and Scotland.\"I wasnt too aware that there was a Melrose in Jamaica, but he said Melrose in the Borders is a lovely place to visit.\"Although she knows of no direct connection to the town ndash \"I think my mother told me it was my sister who chose the name, I dont know where she got it from,\" ndash Melroseand Jamaica have a shared history.The local National Trust of Scotland attraction, Harmony House, will be known to many in the region.The house was built in  by Robert Waugh.Melrose said visiting Harmony House was a \"seminal moment\" in her trip, not only because of the link between Waugh and her name, but also how he profited from her ancestors.In the s Waugh used the profits he brought back with him from Jamaica, where he owned lime and pimento plantations ndash named Melrose and Mount Nelson ndash and slaves, to build his home in the Borders and the nearby chain bridge.Waugh was also financially compensated when slavery was abolished.\"He had built this house out of profits made from my ancestors in Jamaica,\" said Dr Stewart.She added: \"But all in all, in such a short period, the couple of hours we spent there [Melrose], there was just so much to capture about my history and for me it was well worth a visit.\"Dr Stewart explained that she has been able to look back on her history up to the late s.\"Its very dficult as a black person to begin to trace your ancestry because names changed, there was lots of cruelty and all the things going on in terms of how iniduals were treated.\"And this is the sort of history ndash which is painful for all of us from Jamaica because I really dont know where my journey started. It was probably the west coast of Africa. Im not sure who bought my ancestors, how they arrived ndash its just something I started touching the tip of the iceberg really.\"As October marks Black History Month in the UK, Dr Stewart hopes that by addressing the connections we all have to slavery and Britains colonising history, we can have more open and honest conversations about race.She said: \"I think everyone needs to know their history ndash I wasnt taught it at school ndash I knew nothing about my name and its connections with Scotland when I was growing up as a child in England.\"I came here when I was  so all of my secondary schooling was done here and so all of the history I have learnt has been me finding out for myself.\"And obviously things have moved on a bit since then ndash not much.\"I dont think people really know how to manage it [discussions on slavery].\"Because of the sensitivities, people probably think, I didnt do it, its the people that went before me that did that.\"We need to have those sorts of discussions because you might not be personally responsible, but it helps explain in depth why were in the position we are in now.\"The last  months during the coronavirus pandemic have been marked with a number of events where the topic of race has been very prevalent ndash namely the death of George Floyd in America in March , which sparked worldwide Black Lives Matter protests.In the UK this brought about conversations on how we view commemorative statues, plaques and other memorabilia to figures known to have profited from the slave trade.Some call for the figures to be removed from their literalpedestals.The statue of Edward Colston, a slave trader, was famously toppled and thrown into Bristol Harbour in June last year and a statue of Winston Churchill in London was also defaced last year.But others feel the statues could remainmore is done to make their connections to slavery clearer.\"We hope that by learning about the past we dont repeat these atrocities in the future,\" said Dr Stewart.\"We just want history to be told as it was.\"\"We can make it [learning about the slave trade] really interesting for children in schools.\"There are lots of interesting ways in which the curriculum can be changed, and should be changed, the narrative made factual from dferent perspectives.\"Especially in places like Melrose where they probably can even connect with a school in Melrose in Jamaica.\"Making connections is something I would strongly encourage, for children to have the conversation so they can share stories.\"You can imagine how dferent the children in Melrose in Scotland are from the children in Melrose in Jamaica ndash yet theres this strong connection.\""},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-borders-recorded-40-new-cases-last-day","story":"THE Borders has recorded  new cases of coronavirusin the last day, latest figures show.According to Scottish Government data published at pm today , the Borders has now seen , cases of the virus since the start of the pandemic.There remain  people in the hospital in the Borders with confirmed cases of the virus.Scotland has now recorded , cases of the virus since March last year, according to the latest data."},{"url":null,"title":"massive-game-vale-raydale-park","story":"VALE OF Leithen face arguably their biggest game in years this Saturday when they take on fellow Lowland League strugglers Gretna at Raydale Park.The Dumfries and Galloway side, who replaced manager Rowan Alexander with Stephen Hatfield last month, are currently six points ahead of Vale.New Vale head coach Grant Sandison is looking forward to the challenge after witnessing signs of encouragement against Edinburgh University in his first game in charge.After a string of heavy defeats, the club, with four new faces in the starting line-up, limited the students to three goals.But the Innerleithen side created a number of chances of their own and were unlucky to go in at half-time one goal down.Sandison told the Peeblesshire News: ldquoI was happy with the first-half performance against Edinburgh University.\"We set up to be organised and to stop conceding goals and I think we limited them to one shot before they scored from a direct free kick just before half-time.

Look out for the third and final piece in next week#s paper.Wartime needs created additional traffic and pressures for the two main operators, thereafter, once into peacetime, West Coast Motors and its rival were able to modernise their fleets.McConnachie#s stole a march by bringing Kintyre#s first double decker to the town in , buying two more in the late s which older residents may still remember. However, failing general economics resulted in West Coast acquiring this business in . These #deckers never ran for West Coast and it would be more than  years later before such buses entered their fleet.Liveries iniably provide a recognisable identity for any bus operator and West Coast is no exception. The flowering of the company#s one surely came to its climax in the s with the flowing combination of ivory, red and maroon, set off by polished body trim lines and wheel embellishers. Styles continue to evolve but, in the opinion of this writer, no other Scottish operator has chosen a more distinctive colour scheme than West Coast which still uses two of those principal colours, ivory and red, which it bestowed on its buses  years earlier.During the s and s, West Coast#s modern vehicles were typical examples of their time. In the latter period, new bus grants were obtainable under certain conditions resulting in some splendid coaches being purchased.In post war years, the company gradually built on its service network in Kintyre and Mid Argyll. In , it picked up the East Loch – West Loch Tarbert mail ship link from Tarbert-based Dickies then the Tarbert – Kilberry service from McEacherns in , the Lochgilphead Tayvallich service from McLachans in  and, perhaps somewhat prophetically, the Benderloch-based operations of McColls in .Without doubt, the most signicant developments in West Coast#s history occurred in the - period. During the s, William Craig had attempted to introduce a direct Campbeltown to Glasgow service but failed in this ambition then and at later attempts. Finally, in , these hopes were realised when the company became a joint operator, with Scottish Citylink, of the through service between the two locations.The s continued to see signicant developments. Firstly the acquisition, also in , of the buses and Mid Argyll routes operated by Lochgilphead-based Stag Garage. This was followed, a year later, by the purchase of the old MacBrayne garage in Ardrishaig, giving West Coast an excellent base in the area.The early s saw a further involvement in Oban when West Coast secured responsibility for the Oban to Glasgow service and by  it had acquired the former Alexanders depot in Oban enabling it to build further on its already signicant presence in Argyll.Since , the rate of change has quickened further. West Coast secured the Cowal and Bute area contracts and depots in  and when Bowmans, the long-established Mull services operator retired in , West Coast added this to its portfolio. Their Oban base allows vehicle and manpower deployments on Mullneeded. Of the major Argyll islands, only Islay remains independently served by the Mundell concern of Tarbert, whose lorries are also a familiar sight in the county."},{"url":null,"title":"arkell takes dunaverty golf clubs october medal","story":"Lee Mathieson, first man out, took full advantage of the conditions to record the lowest gross score of the day.He completed the first nine in  strokes which included three birdies and one bogey.Despite having a double bogey at the th and a bogey at the th, two birdies on the way back helped him to  strokes.Donald MacNeil was next best, concluding his round in  strokes, having had two bogies on the front and back nines.James Finlay, out in the sixth group, set a nett target of  for those following him to chase.Match secretary Alex Arkell responded in exemplary fashion by not only posting the third lowest gross score of  but also taking the lead from James with a winning nett .Result:  Alex Arkell -

with  minutes played, after a long-range effort arced beyond Ferguson into his top right-hand corner, after nicking off a Pupils defender.Then, on  minutes, the sixth and final Rossvale goal was scored after Ferguson#s save from a striker#s shot rebounded off the post and into the path of a grateful Rossvale winger, who slotted into the net from point-blank range.Overall, the Pupils can reflect on a respectable cup performance,not a giant-killing, against an established semi-professional outfit, especially with an injury-ravaged squad, as the Kintyre Park club adapts to its busiest fixture schedule in its years in amateur football, with  competitive matches already played by mid-October.Despite the heavy defeat for the Pupils on the field, one notable footnote to the game was the presence of former Tarbert AFC and Pupils player Reverend John McGregor, who is club chaplain for Rossvale, having performed the same role at Dumbarton FC in previous years.After the match, he met and chatted with the Pupils management and the current Pupils squad#s Tarbert contingent, Lewis McNaughton and Rhys Casci.Tomorrow, Saturday, the Pupils are back on league duty, travelling to Paisley to play St Peter#s FC.

slot home a fine finish across keeper Alasdair Ferguson with his weaker left foot, into the young keeper’s bottom left-hand corner to make it -.Impressively, the Pupils rebounded from this setback and scored with  minutes played when Liam Renton, playing as an attacking midfielder, latched onto a ball from Scott Souden just inside the hosts# box, and turned his marker sharply before guiding a left-footed shot beyond the keeper#s grasp.All the while, the Pupils# deep-lying midfield pairing – a real contrast of experience levels between skipper Keith Mitchell, and Conner Brown beside him making his club debut – continued to break up play and keep the Feathers Inn-sponsored side moving forward.Despite this, there was a further scare in the visitors# penalty area when St Peter#s hit the bar from a powerful volleyed shot on the stroke of half time, but the Pupils# lead remained intact.Into the second half, though, the Pupils were pegged back in the opening few minutes of proceedings, a clever turn and precise shot beyond the grasp of Ferguson providing a fine equaliser.Admirably from a Pupils point of view, there was no onslaught from the ision#s third-placed team, also boasting a loan signing from Greenock FC, another semi-professional side, in their midfield ranks, and smatterings of semi-pro experience across their starting .However, what followed instead was a gradual build-up of pressure which the Pupils had to work increasingly hard to contain, the home side#s willing forwards continuing to probe for openings in the visitors# defence.The hard-working pair of Matthew Lang and Calum Houston were introduced in attack for the Pupils with  minutes remaining, with fresh legs required as the embattled visitors# energy levels began to wane.But even the dismissal of Lewis for the hosts, hitting out at Renton in reaction to a robust tackle from the latter, which earned the Pupils man a booking, couldn#t deny the Paisley side a late, late winner, a long ball going undefended in the Pupils ranks, and slotted home in the box by a St Peter#s midfielder to give them all three points, and in turn deny the Pupils a probably deserved draw.The Pupils# management team conveyed thanks to the travelling players for their efforts, even in defeat, and will surely take consolation from giving experience to young talent in the side, with four club debuts made in the space of week – after -year-old Andrew Renton#s appearance against Rossvale on cup duty – and within that clutch, a potentially very useful defensive addition.Tomorrow , the Pupils are at home to Glenvale FC, from Paisley, again on league duty, with kick off at pm.For more information, visit @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"leader october 29

The consequences of this decision could be huge.#Tracy explained that the forum, which will hopefully be launched in early November, will have the primary aim of keeping parents and carers updated on all educational matters affecting Argyll and Bute.The forum#s members hope to help parents make their own informed decisions by summarising and bullet-pointing council reports and removing jargon to make it easier for parents to process.#If parents don#t have the information, it#s hard for them to be focused on the issue,# Tracy said.#My concern is not that everyone must think the same way as I do, but that they have the correct information to make up their own minds properly and they don#t agree to something they might later regret.#Parents have got power so they need to make their voices heard.#Argyll and Bute Council#s policy lead for education Councillor Yvonne McNeilly said: #The best outcomes for our young people are at the heart of all our work.#We are a council that listens to our communities and this proactive engagement programme will be at the core of our decision-making.#We very much welcome the views and ideas of our communities and look forward to seeing what their vision is for the future of education services in Argyll and Bute.#To provide the very best for our children and young people we must take positive action to deliver a sustainable education service.

devolution, only certain aspects of the budget announcement apply to people in Scotland.When announcements are England specic,Scotlands overall spending budget will increase thanks to something called the Barnett formula.For example, the UK have proposed to spend pound. billion on dealing with the NHS England backlog, so Scotland will get around .% of this figure because Scotlands population is roughly .% of Englands population.Heres a breakdown of how the budget will impact people in Scotland...Yes - minimum and living wages are not devolved so all changes made by the UK government apply to Scotland.It means that from April  ,those on national living wage in Scotland will be paid pound. hour.The national minimum wage will also see rises:The taper rateis amount your benefit payment

ratewould be reduced to p, a cut of %.This will benefit low-income families where the adults are in work by increasing their overall income.However, it wont impact families who are out of work, who recently faced the pound cut to universal credit which came into force earlier this month.Since benefits are reserved the Westminster and not devolved to Scotland, this taper rate reduction will apply to people in Scotland.English cities will see money invested to improve transport infrastructure.Transport is a devolved matter, however Scotland will get money through the Barnett formula, which is what the UK government uses when they spend more money in England to keep spending more fair.Although Scotland will get money because England are spending more on transport, the Scottish government can do what they please with this money and do not necessarily need to use it for transport.Health is completely devolved, so announcements regarding funding for the NHS refer to NHS England only.However, Scotland will once again get money through the Barnett system, which they could choose to spend on the NHS.For example, during yesterdays Covid update, Nicola Sturgeon confirmed the Scottish government would spend additional money on NHS Scotland.Fuel duty is a tax included in the price ofpetrol, diesel and other fuels used in vehicles or for heating.It is reserved to Westminster, meaning the freeze to the price of fuel duty will apply to Scotland.Foreign affairs are not devolved, so the UK government is in charge of Great Britains border control.This means that thepoundm to protect UK borders, including poundm for a new fleet of patrol boats, will apply to Scotland.According to the UK government, this fund aims to invest in infrastructures which will improve every day le for people across the UK.This pound million allocated to Scotland will back projects in places including Aberdeen and Lewis, Rishi Sunak said in todays announcement.Through the Barnett

It is, of course, for the viewer to react and find their own meaning within the work. I hope over the coming weeks the people of Glasgow can come and enjoy it, and enjoy the beautul building of which it has become a part of.ldquoI think I would like people to take their own meaning from it.

It could be argued that as one of the cityrsquos leading cultural religious location, that it is one of the few tourist attractions open during the summit.Rev Johnstone said: ldquoWe often respond to lsquosacred spacersquo emotionally, physically and spiritually. Some have said sacred space is founded on serious ground. When we encounter something unexpected in a space we thought could predict we can be startled. We may be more than startled when we encounter James Pfaffrsquos new neon piece within the cathedral. It brings the playful high street nuance of neon and places it in a context more associated with civic pomp. The new work allows the lsquolightrsquo to shine, proclaiming an embrace that can be seen as a spiritual mandate.Mr Johnstone described the installation at light across a dark cavernous space and that the eye is drawn towards as people make their way through the cathedral.The present building was consecrated in . Since that same period, the Cathedral has never been without a roof and worship has been carried out within its walls for more than  years.The Cathedral is the best-preserved example of a large church to have survived from the medieval period in Scotland and it has one of the finest post-war collections of stained-glass windows to be found in Britain.During the COP the cathedral is running a number of events including a vigil on Tuesday, November  led by the Iona Community. A special service will be held on Sunday, November  led by Lord Wallace, the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, followed by a COP service.The installation reveal will be held at pm today and is open to the public.Also this evening award-winning artist collective Still Moving are bringing their  metre long and seven metre high light sculpture No New Worlds to Govan for COP.The sculpture has been installed on Govan Graving Docks with the support of a community crowdfunding campaign, with support from Clyde Docks Preservation Initiative. It will sit facing the main delegate zone for the duration of the conference - serving as a stark reminder to delegates that there is no such thing as a New World, we have no plan B.

A y hamstring injury put paid to any hopes that Steyn might have had of adding to that solitary cap last season, then the cancellation of the planned summer Tests added further frustration.But he has been on impressive form in his early outings for Glasgow in this campaign, and showed the Murrayfield crowd - back for a Test for the first time since that France game - just how much they have been missing these past  months with a virtuoso display of finishing.Much of the talk in the build-up to the match had been about the eight debutants Gregor Townsend had selected in his matchday , and it was one of the octet, Rufus McLean, who seized the spotlight early on with his teamrsquos opening two tries. Then, however, Steyn took over where his Warriors team-mate left off, running in a hat-trick before half-time then adding a fourth after the break. It was the first time since Gavin Hastings in the  World Cup match against Ivory Coast that a Scotland player had touched down four times, and the first time altogether at Murrayfield, and Steyn, understandably, was a touch stunned by the whole experience.ldquoIrsquom absolutely buzzing - I canrsquot really put it into words, the -year-old said after the match. ldquoGregor said before the game that it had been  days since we had crowds in, and I was like, shit that means itrsquos  days since I last played for Scotland. Just the whole day, the whole atmosphere about it, was incredible.ldquoIrsquove had one hat-trick at uni level, but nothing like tonight. To be honest, you just get those days. Three of those tries were off set-piece plays where I get to e over in the corner, and then for the other one, Blair [Kinghorn] puts in a cross-kick - he made me work a little bit for it, I couldnrsquot get to it on the full.ldquoDays like this - you want them to come round for so long, then theyrsquore over in a flash. So Irsquove just been trying to soak it in and enjoy it with the boys in the changing room.When told he was the first Scot to score four tries in an international at Murrayfield, he added: ldquoThatrsquos incredibly special. Scottish rugby is steeped in so much history, so to have even a tiny part in that history is pretty humbling.It is not such a tiny part any longer, and, now that he has won a second cap at last, Steyn feels able to look back in good-humoured fashion about that frustrating year and a half which followed his first. ldquoAt one stage I thought someone didnrsquot want me to get a second cap. I was due to play Wales after France and that got canned the day before. Then we were lining up for the summer, with two opportunities there plus the A game, and we all know the story there.ldquoAt one stage, I was like lsquoSomeone has it in for all of us, maybe Irsquoll just stay on one and that will be me!rsquo.Steyn also had a word to say about McLean, who not only created his own tries out of next to nothing, but also began a counter-attack from deep inside his own half that eventually produced his fellow-wingerrsquos third score. ldquoWe keep saying you know what hersquos going to do, but because hersquos so fast, itrsquos so dficult to defend, he said of the -year-old. ldquoI thought all of the debutants were brilliant, which was awesome to see."},{"url":null,"title":"liam-kelly-scotland-hopes-learning-craig-gordon-move-motherwell","story":"But Kelly made the major call to head back north to Motherwell on a permanent deal, and hersquos delighted itrsquos paid off as he hopes to earn another Scotland call-up this week.Steve Clarke is preparing to name his national side for the crucial World Cup qualiers against Moldova and Denmark with Kelly likely to be in the squad alongside Craig Gordon and Jon McLaughlin.But for Kelly, while it has been fruitful ing to Scotland, it was a decision purely based on game-time.ldquoI love playing football so that was the main reason I came back, explained Kelly.ldquoI could be a No in the English Championship with QPR right now but who is going to see me  I wouldnrsquot be involved in a game like the draw with St Mirren, my emotions wouldnrsquot be running high and I just think you should always play and yoursquoll find your level.ldquoIrsquove said so many times there are so many good goalkeepers in the country.ldquoIf I am selected then Irsquom so proud and so happy to be involved andother goalies get selected ahead of me then I just look at them and admire how good a goalie they are.ldquoIrsquom never too downbeatI donrsquot get in because the competition is so strong.ldquoIrsquom just trying to play well at Motherwell andthe manager at Scotland likes that then brilliant.Kelly knows Gordon is likely to take the No shirt but is thrilled to be in contention alongside the giant stopper after learning from him as a youngster.ldquoI was really fortunate that Craig Gordon was in at Rangers when I was there and he was doing his rehab\", said Kelly.\"I was a youth team goalie and he did a lot of training with the under-s at the time to get himself back fit.

On another occasion an attendant has faced verbal abuse from a member of the public as they were dealing with a blocked toilet. Some cases of vandalism have also included fire damage.“These stories are really disappointing to hear about,” said Kenny MacPherson, OIC’s interim head of property, IT and facilities.“Our dedicated and hard-working staff do a fantastic job of keeping our facilities and waiting rooms clean and safe.”“Orkney is often voted as one of the best places to live and work. We all play a part in keeping the place special – including the unsung heroes in our cleaning team who day in, day out, face up to all kinds of situations with dedication and resolve. The ongoing provision of these facilities is a credit to the county while many in other parts of the country are closed. Vandalism and anti-social behaviour detracts from these achievements.“Be kind. Our staff keep the toilets clean and presentable for everyone to use. Staff should not be subjected to verbal or physical abuse when carrying out their duties. There will be times when facilities may temporarily be unavailable due to cleaning operations being carried out and this is to maintain social distancing and everyone’s safety.”If anyone knows any information regarding these incidents of vandalism and antisocial behaviour they can report it to Police Scotland on the non-emergency number  or by contacting Crimestoppers.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I sense every step of that journey.In , Borrodale school closed for that last time. And yet,we listen, we can still hear from Borrodale, forever young and in timeless cèilidh.Put in this kind of context we can sense how community relationships are deeply connected to change. The continuity of change, both backwards and forwards, gives us insight, and proximity with dferent and creative ways of being in place.Times change and culture continues. It is important to be hopeful in this and to not perceive the shadows of the past as a fading le force but as an index pointing to future relationships.The second social experience is of course relates to the typical excitement of guising at Oidhche Shamhna. Originally, Oidhche Shamhna was integral toour sense of place and the cultural relationships of le cycles, including time itself.Oidhche Shamhna is ‘the night of summer’s end,’ and in our older understanding of the festival, it reveals that new le begins in darkness and is born into light similarly, just as days used to begin and end at dusk, the move to the darker half of the year is also the continuation of a cycle and is equally about new beginnings.In the deeper memory of Gaelic cosmology, this is the beginning of the new year, and of course, November is still called ‘an t-Samhain’ in Gàidhlig.My earliest memories of guising would be like those of many, our dad taking my sister and I for a few easy visits to long-standing neighbours and family friends. Even though we would only go to a few houses in those early days, the intensity and excitement of the initiation on a cold dark night was largely experienced through the warmth and kindness revealed in the relationships that emerged in the evening.Guising, then, is a form of cèilidh, where the encouraging and nurturing of the gt of exchange is more intangible than we always appreciate. It is that dimension of sustaining or developing relationships that seems most important to me.One of the first homes we would have visited on my first Oidhche Shamhna will have been that of Angus and Effie Ross in Fàsach. In my early years it was a home that we probably had more time in than any house outside of my family.It was a home I visited everyday day walking home from Borrodale school. My errand was to collect our newspapers from the post office, but it wasn’t a job, it was a relationship.Our family had a strong connection with these Rosses. In , Angus Ross’ great-uncle Alexander Ross had been nominated to deliver the prepared statement for the Fàsach croftersto the Napier Commission.In it he testied specically to the clearance of my great-great-grandfather from Ramasaig , who was removed along with all the families from Ramasaig around -, to make way for sheep, congesting further the land in Fàsach. So, it is from at least that time that our family had been friends.Alexander Ross’s brother, Kenneth Ross, also Fàsach, had among his eight children a first son called Neil and a second called Norman, both being young boys during the land wars....I did know Margaret but I never did met James Ross as he had a fatal accident in the early s in Glasgow, outside the BBC.Angus Ross and Seanair worked together on the County lorry . We saw Angus and Effie a lot and my mum credits him with telling her and her siblings about their Cameron origin story in Glendale.A mysterious tale of a man with long grey hair and a beard living in a cave at Scornandaoine on the east side of Loch Poolteil. He had arrived from Lochaber, in the mid to later s, likely a refugee from any number of social problems in the Gàidhealtachd of that time.Even now it still sounds like a good Halloween story. Certainly, my mum has never been a fan of beards in the family, but we were always welcomed by the Rosses in the ceilidh ethic of everyday relationships., Tobraichean a’ Gluasad .Here, ‘Tuam’ talks about his knowledge of local wells the necessity to move between dferent wells for sustenance, and so there will be times when a well in one place becomes dry while water would be plentul in another well.A resource such as Tobar an Dualchais helps us think about our many and ied relationships with culture, place, and time.Part of the intangible gt to be found within the archives, and also with the people and places around us, is how the wells of culture will be found popping up with all their potential, anywhere and everywhere, carried through the voices and relationships we nurture and come to know.Importantly, this can activate new dialogues, experiences, and gestures of cèilidh, and to embrace these for all in our communities, our futures, wherever the wells emerge."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4172051.jpg--.jpg?1634716497000\n","title":"live practices return for seven towers choir","story":"ON a very pleasant note comes the news this week that Ballymena’s Seven Towers Male Voice Choir has ed for live practice!

Meanwhile, Fred needs blue jeans and a white shirt, and the Shaggy look can be achieved with a simple green T-shirt and pair of brown trousers. If you’ve got a pet dog in your family, a blue collar will make them a perfect Scooby-Doo.The Addams FamilyAs the theme tune goes, they’re creepy and they’re kooky, mysterious and spooky — and that makes them perfect for dressing up as.It’s hard to go wrong with matriarch Morticia Addams.

It’s likely thanks to the live action Cruella film that came out earlier this year, starring a terrying Emma Stone.You can buy the costume online, but who says you can’t DIY this one with a plush faux fur coat  Cruella is Eevee’s favourite look right now, and she managed to put the costume together using second-hand shops. “I was able just to find a dress and alter it to make it shorter, and I found a fur coat and added the black tassels in the back. I was able to put it together for £,” Eevee says. “When I’ve been online, you would have to pay at least £ for the coat alone.”Angel and the devilThese are two Halloween looks that never get old and still pair so well together.

Where there is a genuine attempt to provide information, there is a clear link between the application and the documents provided and a reasonable level of confidence that the person is eligible, they should be veried.”Read MoreNI high street voucher: Over , outstanding applications as Gordon Lyons doesn’t rule out extending schemeCommenting on the dispute was Chief Commissioner of the Equality Commission, Geraldine McGahey.“It goes without saying that all government policy decisions should be taken with the statutory equality duties in mind,” she said. We raised our concerns about the equality impact assessment carried out for this policy in September. We were very disappointed that the screening was not completed at the earliest opportunity in the policy development process and we queried the potential for the screening to actually inform the development or delivery of the High Street Scheme.”She added: “The screening lacked data or information on which to determine impacts across the Section  equality grounds and consequently the assessments that there were no impacts for most of those grounds lacked coherence.A more robust and timely equality assessment would have enabled the Department to thoroughly consider and consult on the potential equality impacts.”She said the scheme appeared to be causing problems for specic groups such as some married women and older people who may not have forms of identication such as a driver’s licence or a valid passport required by the scheme.“There is potential for discrimination against some of these groups who may experience less favourable treatment than others, in this case on grounds of their sex,” she said.“We are writing to the Minister for the Economy today to remind him of the importance of adhering to the Section  duties and asking him to review the deadline set for applying for and using the card to ensure some groups of people are not adversely impacted and left out.“Importantly this situation also highlights the lack of protection for older people who are currently not protected against discrimination in the provision of goods, facilities and services, unlike their counterparts in the rest of the UK and Ireland.”Meanwhile, the Ulster Unionist MLA Andy Allen has called on the Economy Minister Gordon Lyons to extend the period for people to spend their £ vouchers after delays of issuing the cards.“Colleagues and I continue to be contacted by a considerable number of constituents, many of whom applied at the outset of the high street voucher application opening, who have still not received their spend local card,” he said.This is against the backdrop of the thousands of people who were contacted because they could not be veried by the automated process, asking them to provide further evidence. Many of them have been informed it is likely to be a number of weeks before they will receive their card.”Mr Allen said it was now “clearly” the case that the Minister could not guarantee everyone would have four weeks to spend their £ and that it was time to review the end date.Most ReadJohn LavertyOpinionHard man on the pitch, angry, violent man off it... ‘Tweedy’ had a lot of enemiesAs flu cases start to arrive in Northern Ireland hospitals, here’s how to tell the dference between it and CovidPop star George Ezra shares video of Sandy Row brawl with his music in backgroundDown Royal finally back in the saddleTributes to rugby player David Tweed who kept on tackling opponents after he quit gameTop VideosPlayVideo: The moment round-world sailor finds mummied body on drting yachtPlayWatch: New trailer for Kenneth Branagh#s Belfast releasedPlayVisitors hail #amazing#of Down Royal after two yearsLatest Northern IrelandPM calls for rapid progress to be made on finding NI Protocol solutionMary Lou McDonald warns Fianna Fail and Fine Gael ‘writing is on the wall’Man arrested as two officers injured in police pursuit in Newry Two officers injured in police pursuit‘Of course, there were bigots and rogues, but some of the most honourable people I met were in the RUC’, says Peter SheridanLatestDeadline looms to solve Channel fishing row as Britain threatens legal actionStrong gusts from the west to bring a ‘wild start’ to SundayEd Sheeran performs surprise duet with Pride of Britain winner Harmonie-RoseNo evidence for any kind of lockdown despite high case numbers, says PM‘She was my friend’ – Alec Baldwin mourns cinematographer,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That was incredibly dficult’“I was hopeful that this was the end of all that nonsense and a chance for a new beginning,” he said.Now the CEO of peace-building organisation Co-Operation Ireland, he recalls a meeting with Fr Peadar Livingstone, his careers teacher at St Michael’s College in Enniskillen, that was the start of what would become a  year policing career.“I was going in to talk about hotel management and the Post Office were hiring at the time, I was only , but he talked to me about the police cadets and, back then when the priest spoke, you did as you were told.“At the time, I was following George Best and more into chasing girls from the school up the road, but I applied to the RUC, the Met Police and the Garda. The Met came back and said they weren’t recruiting and I’m still waiting to hear back from the Guards”.His family were concerned for his safety — in , it was almost unheard of for a Catholic from Co Fermanagh to join the RUC — however, his grandmother, who lived with the family, took a dferent view.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “This whole discussion was going on and she said, ‘Well,he’s meant to be shot, he’ll never be drowned’, but strangely it made me think, maybe it’s meant to be and, when I look back, she was right.“When I joined, there was only % of the force Catholic and even among that % I suspect some were Catholic in name only.“When we were on the job, Catholic and Protestant never came into it, but the culture was, of course, very Protestant and there was a risk of losing your identity, I probably pushed against that, because I didn’t want to lose who I was.”Targeted twice by the IRA, on one occasion an attack was thwarted only at the last minute and he was forced to move house.“We didn’t move the second time, because the ceasefire came in, but, yeah, on one occasion they had all my details and the kids’ details.“I remember reflecting on all this when thinking about legacy and what is justice. They can get the guy who was going to put the bomb under the car, the guy who made the bomb, the guy who was hijacking the car, the guy who did the house takeover, but for me all those people are less relevant than the person who was meant to be saying their prayers in church on a Sunday collecting information. Was it a neighbour  Was it someone I knew ”Rising through the ranks, Peter Sheridan was a deputy chief constable when he retired in .“Clearly, I was never discriminated against, because of my promotions, and religion wasn’t the same issue internally as it would have been externally.“Of course, there were scoundrels and bigots and rogues and at times like the Twelfth of July, you were aware you from a dferent community, but in the day-to-day working, some of the most honourable and decent people I met were in the police.”In the run-up to the release of the Patten report, Mr Sheridan said that, internally, there was a realisation that change was coming.“There were people who were more political about it and were concerned at the loss of the RUC at the time, I suspect it wasn’t much dferent from what you’d have found in society.“For me, it was an opportunity to try and take politics out of policing. If you were going to do it and do it quickly, you had to do something dferent and   [recruitment] was part of that.”While Mr Sheridan says Patten was a success, he adds that the failure to deal with legacy is polluting modern policing.“The past acts like a bungee rope — all those younger people who signed up to policing, those legacy investigations pull them right back into that ground, even through it’s ground they never walked on.”Related topicsPolice Service of Northern IrelandMore On Police Service of Northern Ireland‘My children were attacked.

This new generation is moving on, together.She accused the DUP of attempting to block the change so many people from all communities demand.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Ms McDonald said her party was preparing for the next Northern Ireland Assembly election, which is due in May.If Sinn Fein emerges as the largest party, we will nominate Michelle O#Neill as first minister, she said. The days of treating any citizen or group of citizens as #less than# or second-class are gone. The challenge for the DUP and political unionism is to respect the democratic decision of the people.In the Republic of Ireland, Sinn Fein is currently the largest party in opposition while in Northern Ireland, it is part of a five-party coalition government.During her keynote speech Ms McDonald also criticised the two leading parties in the Irish government.The writing is on the wall for Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, she said. They are out of touch, out of ideas and out of time.The TD for the Dublin Central constituency highlighted her party#s positions on healthcare, climate change, housing and Irish unity.She said Fianna Fail and Fine Gael practice cynical politics that seeks to normalise a housing crisis and said a Sinn Fein government would fix housing and healthcare.Describing the partition of Ireland as a catastrophe, Ms McDonald said her party would begin a people#s conversation on Irish unity from January and called for a citizens# assembly on the topic to be established.Sinn Fein deputy leader Michelle O#Neill earlier the balance of power in Northern Ireland has now shted irreversibly away from unionism amid the disappearance of their political majority.She said unionist reluctance to indicate whether they would accept the post of deputy first minister after May#s assembly election was not a decision for politicians and said the electorate would decide. The DUP has declared that a Sinn Féin first minister after the next election would give unionism a real problem, she said.Well, let me be crystal clear. The days of nationalists need not apply are gone.The days of denying abortion rights to women, to LGBT citizens, and Irish language speakers are gone.It is for the people to decide the next first minister, not the DUP.Her priority was to work with the other Stormont parties to solve problems, said Ms O#NeillPeople are relying on us to address the crisis in healthcare, in waiting lists and getting access to a GP, she said.To support them through the cost-of-living crisis which is hurting every family and household.Earlier, party members voted overwhelmingly to end their long-standing opposition to all non-jury trials at the Republic of Ireland#s Special Criminal Court.Ms McDonald had said that, as a TD who represented a constituency affected by gangland crime, she recognised there was a need in exceptional circumstances for non-jury trials.The number of attendees at this year#s Ard Fheis was reduced substantially from previous years due to Covid- regulations, said the party.Everyone attending the event was expected to provide proof of vaccination for Covid-, it added.Most ReadJohn LavertyOpinionHard man on the pitch, angry, violent man off it... ‘Tweedy’ had a lot of enemiesAs flu cases start to arrive in Northern Ireland hospitals, here’s how to tell the dference between it and CovidPop star George Ezra shares video of Sandy Row brawl with his music in backgroundDown Royal finally back in the saddleTributes to rugby player David Tweed who kept on tackling opponents after he quit gameTop VideosPlayWatch: New trailer for Kenneth Branagh#s Belfast releasedPlayVideo: The moment round-world sailor finds mummied body on drting yachtPlayVisitors hail #amazing#of Down Royal after two yearsLatest Northern IrelandPM calls for rapid progress to be made on finding NI Protocol solutionMary Lou McDonald warns Fianna Fail and Fine Gael ‘writing is on the wall’Man arrested as two officers injured in police pursuit in Newry Two officers injured in police pursuit‘Of course, there were bigots and rogues, but some of the most honourable people I met were in the RUC’, says Peter SheridanLatestDeadline looms to solve Channel fishing row as Britain threatens legal actionStrong gusts from the west to bring a ‘wild start’ to SundayEd Sheeran performs surprise duet with Pride of Britain winner Harmonie-RoseNo evidence for any kind of lockdown despite high case numbers, says PM‘She was my friend’ – Alec Baldwin mourns cinematographer,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Most smartphones, tablets and computers will make this change automatically.It#s good news for many as it means an extra hour in bed, while the mornings will be brighter and evenings darker over the coming months.The practice of switching the clocks was first introduced by Germany around the time of World War I to save energy by prolonging evening daylight in summer.Reverting to Greenwich Mean Timefrom British Summer Time- also known as Daylight Saving Time- marks the official end of British summertime.

It comes as part of the Northern Irelands Executives winter Covid contingency plans. The Executive said there was a need to keep as many sectors open to the fullest possible extent. First Minister, Paul Givan said doing that would depend on as many people as possible getting vaccinated.” googletag.cmd.push Just over % of people aged  and above in Northern Ireland had received one dose of the vaccine. Mr Givan said: Our vaccination rates are very good but there is still room for improvement.” Further Covid restrictions are due to be relaxed by the Executive onOctober . This will allow for nightclubs to reopen, restrictions on indoor dancing lted and the requirement to be seated in hospitality to drink and eat food will no longer be in place. Mr Givan said it was a fact of le that Covid remains an ongoing issue, and that the Executive needed to continue to find ways to manage the situation. The First Minister says that the Executive will launch a new public information campaign before the end of October to build on the need for all of us to keep making safer choices.

Colin has performed a few small gigs since restrictions were lted and had his first postponed ticketed show atBelfast’s Orchestra Hall earlier this month.This was his first show of the set that was due to go ahead in March  before lockdown began. googletag.cmd.push Murphy said it has been a long time coming: I’m just trying to remember the whole set. Its mad- and you have to write a whole new bit as well because you know, obviously stuff has happened. “It’s weird having a stage again, people, an audience. I didnt do any gigs during lockdown. Other people did, and some people really enjoyed them, but that didn’t really appeal to me, so I just decided to wait. “It was pretty scary going back to live shows. It was like starting all over again, like doing a show for the very first time again, which was good. “I had an adrenaline rush for about a week.” Colin decided not to gig virtually during lockdown and spent his time on other things: “We did a couple of series of the Blame Game with the virtual zoom audience. I then did a show on RTE as well, that had no audience. “I had the obligatorypodcast that everybody did. Then I was just doing what everyone  was doing, learning skills. I just amused myself. Painting, just doing stuffto pass the time. “It was a foretaste of what retirement will be like, unless you’re under , and then youre never going to be able to retire. That was your year and a half of retirement.” Colin’s new show, Colonisation, toured theatres across Northern Ireland. He had four shows left, including at the Millenium Forum, before lockdown hit. He last performed in the Millenium in : “I was last performing in Derry with the last tour. I was really annoyed this time because this show sold more tickets than Ive ever sold before in the Millennium and then it was pulled. “Thankfullypeople haven’t asked for their money back, so thank you people of Derry. I need to remind people that the gig is on because people were given these tickets for Christmas presents and so on in , they’ll be sitting on a fridge somewhere covered in coffee stains, so its just to remind people as well that it is actually happening.” Colin isn’t making any drastic plans for the next year and beyond, after everything the last  months has thrown at the entertainment business: “I’m doing the ones that Ive got and then I’ll just see what happens after Christmas. “I’m just excited to get back to a live audience. The virtual audiences you know, theyre not the same. Its just not the same. “The whole thing of being in an audience is the collective feeling of people around you and sharing something and even though you are sort of doing that on Zoom, you’re in your own living room. I know some people are a little bit nervous about being in an audience again, but I think, for the shows, theyre taking all the precautions that they can.” Colin said there will be chat of COVID because we’ve all experienced the pandemic, but there will be other content: “Well be messing around and talking to the audience as usual. “My live shows never really have a theme, its always just what’s been going on in the world and my le. Check your emails and your junk box, Derry, the show is happening. Come along, have a nice time, enjoy being out and about and stay safe.” Colin Murphy performs at the Millenium Forum on Saturday November .

The whole ward of Eglinton and Claudy will be transferred from Foyle much to the chagrin of some. “Having spoken with iniduals impacted by this restructuring it’s clear that many have concerns about the implications and have expressed their desire to remain within the Foyle constituency. “Elected representatives have built a rapport with many of their constituents, particularly in the Eglinton ward and its removal would be a great loss to Foyle. “The Boundary Commission is carrying out a public consultation on these changes, which will be followed by further consultations and public hearings before final recommendations are made in July . “However, the SDLP are currently preparing a response to the initial consultation and are keen to hear the views of Eglinton residents by December . “I would urge anyone impacted to get in touch with any of the SDLP offices and have their voices heard.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Mr Eastwood was speaking ahead of the easing of restrictions in the North on Sunday October . SDLP Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon argued for the introduction of vaccine certications at the Executive, but it was opposed by Sinn Feacutein and the DUP. googletag.cmd.push Mr Eastwood said: “The easing of restrictions this weekend has been cause for much excitement. “The public will be happy they can once againto nightclubs and businesses will be rightfully ecstatic to open their doors for the first time in nearly two years. While this is welcome, we cannot ignore the fact that our hospitals are under increasing pressure. “Rarely a day goes by without another horror story about the state our health service is in. This year’s winter pressures have arrived earlier than normal and are affecting services across the board. Our health staff are crying out for help, they know what’s to come.     We are still recording over , new cases of the virus daily and people are dying.“We cannot continue to lt restrictions without mitigations while we are in this situation. Eventually the pressure on our health service will increase and we will be faced with tough decisions. Nobody wants to see another lockdown, it will have a devastating impact on people’s mental health, businesses and their staff. “We have a proven alternative that will allow us to prevent another lockdown while protecting our health service from being overrun – vaccine certications. “The evidence from other jurisdictions is clear – the introduction of vaccine certications encourages vaccine uptake, particularly in younger age groups. Surely this is not too much to ask in the interests of keeping the public, their families and our staff safe. “Our proposals for vaccine certications were blocked at the Executive by Sinn Feacutein and the DUP who instead left the matter in the hands of inidual businesses. This will create confusion and pressure for both businesses and their staff from patrons who may experience dfering rules from one venue to the next.“This decision marks a serious abdication of responsibility and leadership, with the consequences set to play out in our hospitals in the months to come. I hope the impact of this weekend’s reopening will be closely monitored and Sinn Feacutein-DUP ministers will reconsider their decision on vaccine certication before it’s too late.” The Welsh and Scottish Governments have both implemented proof of vaccination in order to enter nightclubs and other large capacity events and venues.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm.     When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

So, I told the parents who came to me I would bring it up at council.ldquoThe motion will be seconded by Cllr Sean Carrandit is passed, which I have no doubt it will be, it will become the official corporate position of Derry City and Strabane District Council, which will write to the ious bodies named in the motion.ldquoA lot of it is aspirational but it will highlight the issue and bring it out into the public domain. It will also send a message to the parents who contacted me that we are going to push this agenda and try and ensure Year  who want to do A-Level Irish, we will back them. We are also going to write to the Department of Education and the Education Authority, said Cllr Donnelly.RELATEDIrish is being marginalised and its importance downgradedLegislative authorities,governors and principals have to realise Irish language more than a school subjectA Level Irish provision absolute disasterPolicy of undermining Irish - Aontuacute Education spokespersonAnger at lack of Irish A-Level provision in Derry schoolsNo access for Year  students grossly unfairLast month, Bishop of Derry, Most Reverend Dr Doacutenal McKeown, said the purpose of the Area Learning Communities was that pupils who wished to study a subject like Irish should be able to attend classes in a school.He added: ldquoThat comes down to both planning and agreement between the schools in question. Thus,the Foyle Learning Community has not offered that subject co-operation, it would be appropriate to ask them and the governors of schools that are involved, why not. With plenty of fore-knowledge and forward planning, co-operation ought to be possible.Councillor, Emmet Doyle Aontuacute said he did not understand how timetabling could stand in the way of a childs education.In addition, Professor Malachy Oacute Neill, the director of regional engagement at Ulster University, said he would be following the issue up with the chairperson of the Foyle Learning Community Network in order to clary the situation.Reacuteamonn Oacute Ciaraacutein, the director of education with Gael Linn, placed the blame squarely on the legislative authorities, boards of governors and principals.In September, Mr Oacute Ciaraacutein chaired an online discussion on the critical decline in the uptake of Irish in English-medium post primary schools. The discussion was attended by  teachers who felt compelled to seek urgent and decisive action..They called upon the legislative bodies of the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Department of Education and their armrsquosbodies, such as CCEA, as well as the Education Authority, to intercede as matter of urgency to reverse the worrying trends in the study of the Irish language and other languages in English-medium post-primary schools.Aontuacute education spokesperson and representative for East Derry, Gemma Brolly, expressed wholehearted support for Gael Linns position.She added: ldquoWe would also like to reiterate our demand for accessibility to A Level Irish language courses for our young people throughout the North.ldquoAs education spokes- person and a gaeilgeoir myself, I would like to assure Gael Linn and all involved, we stand firmly, shoulder to shoulder with teachers, academics, authors and Irish language activists in their demand for urgent and decisive action to undo the wrongs and commit to the recommendation of studying a modern language at GCSE Level.Cllr Donnelly said his motion would also acknowledge the proud history of Irish language learning in Derry and Strabane, particularly the rich learning experience afforded to generations of post-primary pupils, instilling a love for Irish language and culture in many of our citizens, and widening career opportunities.ldquoThe motion further states:This council recognises the continuous growth in demand for Irish-medium education in this council area and beyond as reflected in the thriving communities in our local Irish-medium pre-schools and primary schools. Council welcomes the creation of new jobs, career opportunities and pathways in and around the Irish language, particularly in the context of forthcoming legislation.ADVERTISEMENT -- -- Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- -- Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- -- Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The scheme is a recycling initiative which he had championed during his time as Environment Minister and has worked to progress in recent years. In response to an Assembly Question tabled by Mr Durkan, the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , Edwin Poots reaffirmed his commitment to introduce the scheme, following the department’s joint consultation with DAERA and the Welsh Government. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle MLA said: “I’m pleased that work is continuing to progress a depositscheme for Northern Ireland. “This is a scheme which began work on during my time as Environment Minister, having seen their benefits in other countries. “Unfortunately, at that time my attempts were met with some resistance, both politically and commercially. “In February , the Executive supported my calls for the introduction of a depositscheme and committed to the North’s participation in a proposed UK-wide rollout. I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy.     “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment. “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Cllr Harkin had tabled a motion calling for Council to support retail workers right to receive time off during the Christmas and New Year period. googletag.cmd.push The Foyleside councillor cited a survey conducted by trade union Usdaw that consulted its members across the north of Ireland with a vast majority in favour of such a measure. Cllr Harkin also cited that other trade unions in the north had backed Usdaws demands. Cllr Harkins motion read: “Council notes its concern that many workers in a wide range of dferent sectors are not receiving a decent break from work over the Christmas and New Year holiday period. “Council notes the results of the Christmas and New Year working surveys by Usdaw which show  per cent of respondents from across the North said that they spend too little time at Christmas with family and friends. Christmas Day trading legislation means that nearly all shops do not trade on Christmas Day.     “However, many retail workers report that for them, Christmas is just a day off, not a holiday. Long hours in the run-up to Christmas and shops re-opening early on Boxing Day leaves many retail workers too exhausted and with insufficient time off to enjoy the Christmas holiday. “Council commits to supporting the campaign to allow retail workers to have quality time with family and enjoy the benefit of the break in the way so many of us do rather than use Christmas Day as a day of recuperation. “Council supports Usdaws call, backed by the March  NIC-ICTU Biennial Delegate Conference, for early closure on Christmas Eve and New Year’s Eve Closure on Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year’s Day and no loss of pay for retail workers when stores are closed. “Council will write to large retailers in our district area and to the Stormont Executive requesting they support these demands.”  Trade Union Usdaw are campaigning for time off for retail workers in Derry and across the north of Ireland However, Cllr Brian Tierneytabled an amendment saying the motion should encourage dialogue between employers and employees as he had spoken with a number of workers this past week and was told that working the festive period should still be there for them to do. Cllr Tierneys amendment put forward the removal of the last paragraph of Cllr Harkins motion and replace it with: “Council will write to large retailers encouraging them to begin meaningful discussion with their employees around opening times on Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Years Day.” In explaining his reasons for the amendment, Cllr Tierney said: “This motion states a lot of facts but from what I can see from the motion its Usdaws responses from its members across the north of Ireland. It doesnt tell me anything about retail workers from across this city and district. “Theres no doubt that the workers deserve this time off and theres no doubt they have worked hard right throughout the entire year. “But we dont actually knowretail workers across this city and district want these demands met. Ive spoken to retail workers over the last number of days who have told me that they take a benefit for working these particular days over Christmas. “A majority of them are getting double-time because the pay-cycle is so long over December that many people actually budget the double-time they receive for the following January. “By supporting the motion as it is, we could be taking that leline away. We are all for getting good terms and conditions for workers. “But they have to be terms and conditions that those workers want, not what Usdaw wants. We want and encourage employers to speak to their employees and come up with reasonable ways forward.” Cllr Harkin was not happy with what he saw as Cllr Tierney diluting his motion and responded in no uncertain terms his anger at the amendment. He said: “There is no level playing field here. What you have here are big corporations making tremendous amounts of money and not treating their workers properly – be that with low wages, forcing them to work far too many hours and making them work right through the festive period. “I think what the SDLP are saying here is absolute anti- union nonsense.Brianhas talked to a few people in Derry who say I am not sure about this. “The entire trade union movement across the northis backing this demand from Usdaw. Theyve been campaigning for it for years. “Ive talked to lots of workers who tell me all the time that they hate the fact that they have to work right through the Christmas period. “The demand actually makes it clear that workers who are scheduled to work should suffer no loss of pay. Thats a demand we have to take to these corporations. “We have to send a clear message to the bosses that they need to start treating their workers a lot better. “Thisis trying to appease the employers and make it seem like workers are happy to be working at six am on Boxing Day. “This just seems to me that the SDLP are saying that they know better than the entire trade union movement across the north. Usdaws demand has been supported by every trade union in the north of Ireland. “The amendment doesnt have my support as it loses the point.” Cllr Gary Donnellyalso voiced his opposition to the amendment adding: “I had no problem with the motion as it stood until the SDLP tried to ride two horses here by bringing in a half-a-loaf anti- union amendment. And this from a so-called Labour party. Its not even surprising.” The amendment was voted on and the SDLP amendment was passed by  to  – with eight votes from unionist members being pivotal in carrying it through. Despite the amendment being accepted, Cllr Harkin did not withdraw the motion. He said: “This motion can still send a clear message to employers because the demands havent been stripped out by the SDLP and the DUP. They havent stripped out that Usdaw did do a survey on this. “Trade unions are attempting to campaign for a better deal for ordinary people. But its going to be hard and its going to be harder because political parties are not willing to actually stand up to corporations. “They are willing to have a very blaseacute approach to workers rights and I think we have to start being clear that patting people on the back and thanking them for being there during the pandemic just doesnt cut it anymore. “People deserve to see real gains but those gains arent just going to be gted to them. They are going to have to be fought for.” The motion with the amendment was passed unanimously by Council.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.    Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.         The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.    Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound. Manus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. Two versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute ‘short version’ by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board.

Also included are Manus and Majella Martin. uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ue u uc p ue r n ucp ueThe youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O ursquoNeill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from  ulsquoTeenage Kicks ursquo to  ulsquoMy Perfect Cousin ursquo to  ulsquoIt ursquos Going To Happen ursquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O ursquoNeill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThe way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage, urdquo he said.  uldquoWe really have no bad feelings towards him. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. uc p ue r n ucp ueCaroline O ursquoNeill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoHe ursquos going to kill me for saying this, urdquo she said.  uldquoBut he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ue ucstrong ueNot so good-natured abuse uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ueThe laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThere were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street, urdquo admits Damien O ursquoNeill. uc p ue r n ucp ueAnd Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home:  uldquoIt was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn ursquot buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. uc p ue r n ucp uePaul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal ursquos shoes described the documentary as  uldquobrilliant, really enjoyable urdquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueJohn O ursquoNeill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets:  uldquoI think it ursquos great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big. urdquo u uc p ue r n ucp ueThe screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over  upound. uc p ue r n ucp ueManus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. u uc p ue r n ucp ueTwo versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute  ulsquoshort version ursquo by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board. uc p ue r n ucp ue ucspan style ud \"color: #ff \" ue ucstrong ueClick the Next ugt tab to go through the gallery uc strong ue uc span ue uc p ue r n ucp ue[articlepreview id ud \" \" link ud \"https:www.derrynow video multimedia  watch-the-story-of-the-undertones-.html \"] uc p ue r n uc  ue r n uc  ue r n uc class ud \"vc_story_telling \" data-position ud \" \" data-story ud \" \" ue r n ucp class ud \"vc_story_telling_title \" ue u uc p ue r n uc class ud \"vc_story_telling_text \" ue r n ucp ue ucspan style ud \"color: #ff \" ue ucstrong ueThe Undertones Premier. . .

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound. Manus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. Two versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute ‘short version’ by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board.

The comments were made during a Government press conference on Tuesday October th, after the announcement of the countrysrevised reopening plan, where Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin confirmed all of the restrictions set to ease from Friday,  October and the restrictions that will remain in place. googletag.cmd.push The pandemic isnt over yet. Unfortunately, were going to have to get through at least another winter before we can safely say that its behind us, Varadkar said at the press conference. The situation took a turn for the worse about two or three weeks ago and since then, weve seen rising case numbers, rising hospitalisations and rising ICU numbers.So, were not where we hoped to be or expected to be for  October... were not past the peak of the Delta wave. Later in the press conference, he said the government would be meeting with unions and employer representatives to update the Work Safely Protocol. Well have that done over the next couple of days and essentially what were saying is that a staggered and phasedto the office is possible, he explained. So, people going back to the office for a specic business purpose, like a meeting or a training, for example, or inductions - that is allowed. But certainly people who can work from home and want to continue to work from home, their employer should facilitate that. But bear in mind, there are also people whove been working from home with a laptop on a bed for  months now and they really want to get back to the office. Andthat can be facilitated,they can be in an office on their own or in an office where theyre socially distanced from other people, that should be facilitated too. But the fullto offices as we knew them, that will be next spring, added the Taacutenaiste. The announcement from the Taacutenaiste comes days after Deputy Chief Medical OfficerDr. Ronan Glynn advised the public towork from home where possiblethis autumn and winter.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

And so it proved. St Patricks are back in the last four for the second year running under the tutelage of Bradley and Antrim native Kevin Brady. googletag.cmd.push The Loughshore side have hit an impressive  goals in championship football, winning all but one game a group clash with Dungiven. Joint manager Kevin Brady says the scores are a sign of the players footballing intelligence. “The boys have taken the goals well and the boys themselves on the field sense when a goal opportunity is on,” he said. “We have quite smart players in that regard, and so far, they have executed them well. They will probably be fewer and farther between in terms of the chances that Glen will give us. “Weve unearthed another couple of players, not necessarily young players, but guys who are early to mid-s who might not have been making the senior team previously.     Loup manager Paddy Bradley. “Theyve taken their chance. Some players have seen that was the case last year and a few other fellas have stepped up and staked their claim for a place.” That progress will be needed as they prepare to take on Watty Grahams. The  finalists misfired in last years championship, exiting to fierce rivals and eventual winners Slaughtneil at the quarter final stage. Glen have set about righting that wrong with a vengeance and showed their intent in appointing Malachy ORourke as manager. They have amassed a - championship haul over five games, with goals from Paul Gunning and Conleth McGuckian easing them past Swatragh in this years quarter final. It is a side sprinkled with talent and the mercurial Conor Glass and Ciaran McFaul at its heart, and the conveyor belt has created a cohesive blend of youth and experience. Terence OBriens renaissance has had a big impact for Loup, and the big midfielder fired home a goal in the win over Bellaghy. Midfield partner Paddy Coney also chipped in with a goal in that game, and the ever-present trio of Anthony ONeill, Ciaran Devlin and Caolan Devlin are a handful for any defence. Defensively, the lads from the Glenshane have the edge, conceding -to Loups -throughout the championship, but the figures suggest it could be an open game. Malachy ORourke is in charge of Glen. Kevin Brady says thats not necessarily the case. “Hopefully it will be an entertaining game from a neutral point of view,” he said. “Glen certainly put you under a lot of pressure. You dont really get any time to catch your breath, so I expect it to be high intensity. “Its sometimes hard to know. A goal going in at some point can make the other team come out and play. “Hopefully the disappointment of last year will spur our boys on to go one step further and make the final this year.” The bookies will certainly favour Glen, but Loups traditionally attack-minded managerial duo will be relishing a chance to lock horns with Malachy ORourke in the heat of championship battle. The Owenbeg pitch is in better condition than it has been in previous years, and will help create firm enough underfoot conditions for both these sides to serve up an entertaining battle. Loup have managed an average of three goals per game, and this game could well all come down to how well Loup manage to balance the guages of risk and reward on Sunday evening.

It looked asPromise Omochere’s second half goal would be enough for Bohs, until Boyce struck with his th goal of the campaign to save the hosts. Bohs shocked Derry by taking the lead less than five minutes into the second half. A ball forward saw Eoin Toal and Promise Omochere battle for possession, and the striker emerged with the ball before shooting low past Gartside and into the net from  yards. googletag.cmd.push It should have been game over for Derry  minutes from time when Gartside completely messed up a routine clearance, and Ali Coote set up Ross Tierney for a tap in, only for an incredible clearance from Eoin Toal to deny Bohs a second goal. Derry responded well to that scare and came so close to equalising. A long throw into the area by Will Fitzgerald was flicked on by Toal, and it came to Junior who volleyed the ball past Talbot but the ball hit the underside of the crossbar and somehow stayed out. It looked asDerry were out of luck, but deep into added time, James Akintunde’s cross went all the way to the back post where Boyce was on hand to bundle the ball over the line to save what could be a huge point for Ruaidhri Higgins’ team.

AlthoughHannah Peel loses both the NI Music Prize AND The Mercury Music Prize you can safely assume that the Irish music scene has imploded. googletag.cmd.push Incidentally, Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic was the best album released in the last year, including re-released eps, Waldorf  Cannon’s We Are Your Government was the best single. There haven’t been any new bands apparently to contend with nor was there any live acts to mention…but were there in   Anyway. Stendhal. For some unknown reason people tend to review bands at festivals and neglect the organisation. John once said: “The first festival back felt a bit magical. Before the event, setting up it felt like the whole placewere sitting simmering to deliver something very special. “Everyone who turned out, be it artists audiences or crew, just got into the spirit of what it was and how much it meant after a long  months. July’s instalment of Stendhal Festival was a success on several dferent levels.     From finally being allowed to provide artists a live  to a captivated responsive crowd, bringing much needed economic benefit to the local area which depends so much on tourism, to helping find a way forward for the events industry in a post pandemic environment. The team at Stendhal have again done the event proud in their endeavours to find a balance in providing a safe yet welcoming environment. “On a personal note, being able to see the excitement of the artists, festival heads and families over the course of the weekend brought a smile to my face”. And Colm O’Donnell once added “After a long  months, July’s instalment of Stendhal Festival was a success on a number of dferent levels. From finally being allowed to provide artists a live  to a captivated responsive crowd, bringing much needed economic benefit to the local area which depends so much on tourism, to helping find a way forward for the events industry in a post pandemic environment. With those in attendance noticeably enjoying theof live music to the farm, it’s made the work behind the scenes worthwhile. “The team at Stendhal have again done the event proud in their endeavours to find a balance in providing a safe yet welcoming environment. On a personal note, being able to see the excitement of the artists, festival heads and families over the course of the weekend definitely brought a smile to my face.” Following their ambitious endeavour in producing two covid compliant music festivals in , Stendhal Festival has announced that it will be ing to the one festival format in  and that their one festival will begin on the very last day of June , running to July nd. The two smaller events which instigated numerous social distancing protocols combined to create the largest gathering of tents at a music festival anywhere in Ireland in  and with that experience under their belts, the team behind the multi-award- winning event have decided that the best way to try and get back to normality is to press forward with one larger event for approximately , people. Festival Director Ross Parkhill explained: “Despite the dficulties, the uncertainties and all the additional rules and regulations we had to impose, both events in  went off really well and people really worked incredibly well with us to ensure that was the case. “Running two events provided big challenges for us but happily, as always, our amazing team rose to the occasion twice and more people camped at a music festival at Stendhal than anywhere  on the Island of Ireland this year, something we can really be proud of.” Ross continued: “Going forward though, to continue with the model of two smaller events would not be practical for us and we are confident that people are a bit more confident themselves now about ing to large scale outdoor gigs, as witnessed at a number of events in Belfast throughout September. “With that in mind, with the eradication of social distancing rules for outdoor spaces and with plenty of lessons learned from our events in , we are confident that we canto our usual event set up in  and safely welcome over , patrons to the farm once again.” Super Saver Early bird tickets for Stendhal  will be on sale on October thth at pm and will be available until January th, when the organisers are hoping to make their first batch of line-up announcements. “By moving the event forward by about  weeks we have to hit the ground running,” added Ross, “we also don’t have any major uncertainties aboutwe can run or not next year so expect us to have plenty of info regrading Stendhal  out early in the new year, when we will also be opening our annual artists submission process.” For tickets and more info regarding Stendhal Festival , visit www.stendhalfestival  Magee on Music: London Calling with Derry-born Stephen McLaughlin  Kevin Magee speaks with Derry-born and London-based artist Stephen McLaughlin    Magee on Music: New Sounds with Conor Cummings  Kevin Magee speaks with Derry based singer Conor Cummings    Magee on Music: Not Peter Gabriel  Kevin Magee speaks to Derry band members Invaderband on the upcoming launch of their new album  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The replica kits were brilliant even though the shorts were a wee bit too long for my liking, said Tollymore club chairman Adrian Howard.ldquoOur guys really got into the spirit of things with the  moustaches and at one point I thought history was repeating itself with the teams locked at -. But it wasnrsquot to be with the English boys winning -.After such a wet and dismal start to last week, Donard Park was bathed in sunshine for the match and despite all the best laid plans, the England team was delayed on route from the airport.However, this gave Mr Lewis the opportunity to meet some volunteer coaches and officials from the Tollymore club. He chatted to coaches Simon Thornton and Dr Gavin Devlin about their involvement with the club and volunteering in general.Mr Lewis also met Seamus Heath and Mark Hughes, from the NI Veterans team who were involved in organising the fixture.The project is one of  funded through the Shared History Fund which supports groups to mark the Centenary, in a thoughtful, inclusive and engaging way.The Tollymore Club has been working on its project since October last year and was very pleased to hear that it had been awarded funding to deliver the project and to date the ious events have been extremely well received.ldquoI would like to thank everyone for taking part and making this part of our project such a success, in particular, the guests for attending and Rob Manley of the Anchor Bar for providing gts for the Secretary of State, council chairwoman Cathy Mason and Darren Rice from Heritage Lottery NI, said Adrian.The Tollymore club presented a number of gts to the Secretary of State including a framed print of Newcastle, circa , provided by Mr Ivor Anderson. He also received a replica  England top and The Friend at Hand Irish Whiskey presentation box.Gts of The Friend at Hand Irish Whiskey were also made to the council chairwoman and Mr Darren Rice.Also in attendance at the event was South Down MLA Jim Wells, a huge Northern Football fan and regular attender at the teamrsquos home fixtures.The latest football match starring the veterans is a testament to how far the teams have developed over the past few years.Formed almost  years ago after Tollymore United organised a long running five-a-side football programme, the NI Veterans encourage men that had stopped playing regular football to get back playing.The veterans believe that age should not be a barrier to playing football and that there are incalculable health benefits, both physical and mental, to keeping active.Players ages range from rsquos through to rsquos with teams at over rsquos, over rsquos, over rsquos and over rsquos age groups.Every year the NI Veterans take part in a home internationals tournament with their English, Scottish and Welsh counterparts and travel to venues across the UK, with the home internationals played in a dferent country each year.Players meet their own travel and accommodation costs with Tollymore United offering their pitch for home fixtures and the Anchor Bar providing visiting teams with food and refreshments.Veteranrsquos football is huge in England and Wales with organised leagues and dozens of teams. It is also becoming increasingly popular in Europe with the NI Veterans having played European opposition.Last Fridayrsquos football match was the third of four events that the Tollymore club is delivering as part of their project.The first part of the project was a talk on the events leading up to lsquoThe Partition of Irelandrsquo with leading historian Dr Cormac Moore and took place in July.

In my opinion this does not appear to be consistent with the regulations which clearly suggest mph was more appropriate, but it is still a positive result after many years of campaigning.ldquoRoad Service Officials confirmed to me last January that the mph limit would be introduced this year and we have all been tenterhooks waiting delivery day. It is great to see this project over the line at long last.Ballynoe resident, Billy McGrath, has appealed to parents whose children attended Legamaddy School to respect the new speed limits.He added: ldquoIt gets a bit frightening here sometimes in the morning so can everyone please slow down..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/20October2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Better paths plan on banks of Quoile  ","story":"PLANS to signicantly enhance riverside walks along the banks of the Quoile in Downpatrick have taken a major step forward.Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Covid recovery working group has agreed to fund a new master plan which is being drawn up for the area, with representatives from a number of key organisations asked for their input on the way forward.The investment proposal is part of a part of a much-needed refurbishment project at a part of Downpatrick which is popular with local people and visitors to the areal, with plans to upgrade large sections of the Quoile River walk from the Belfast Road, along Janersquos Shore pathway to connect to the Quoile Pondage.The works will include the replacement of ageing boardwalks, fencing and gates with updated sigs provided. Similar to previous improvement schemes at the Quoile Pondage, the path will also be widened and the surface improved to make it much more accessible for families and those with disabilities.Cllrs Oonagh Hanlon and Cathy Mason have welcomed the Covid working grouprsquos decision to support the master plan which will upgrade existing pathways which have are becoming increasingly popular.Cllr Hanlon said the master plan also proposes the creation of new greenways and trails and is keen to hear from residents and visitors how they would like to see the area developed.ldquoThis will be vital in enhancing the tourist and heritage offerings we have locally and create better linkages to the town centre, she continued.ldquoThese plans complement the local councilrsquos ongoing plans to carry out repairs to the popular Lecale Way walking trails at Janersquos Shore and at Sheepland in Ardglass and other areas trails around the Lecale coastline.Cllr Mason said as a result of the impact of the pandemic and the restrictions introduced to curb the spread of the virus, many areas have experienced an increased use of outdoor open spaces.She continued: ldquoThis has been so important for the health and well-being of residents and visitors to our area.

It didnrsquot even rain on the day. All in all, it was a good way to start the season.The event included a full programme of junior racing so the atmosphere was buzzing by the time the seniors arrived at the Billy Neill playing fields in Comber.As the last junior race finished, the senior women swarmed to the start area. East Down AC was out in force with  females on the start list plus Wayne Giles by virtue of being in the Male  plus age group was in the same race.The runners were herded into pens to await the whistle and in fact when the race started two minutes early, some of the team were nearly caught on the hop as they were facing the wrong way getting their photo taken.Off they went at a pace across the level grass of the pitches stretching out quickly from a pack to a winding snake of coloured vests.They then turned sharply to get on to the hilliest section for the first time.This part is a gradual but leg sapping climb with the odd flatter bit for respite.Even after reaching the top, there are a few lumpy bits before a welcome downhill section. The runners then have a road crossing to contend with before sweeping round to the next loop.For women and male plus, it was three laps to make the k which meant three chances to try dfering techniques on the hill.At the end of the last lap there was an added cruel twist - a steep uphill to the finish which seemed primarily to be for the entertainment of spectators.It required huge reserves to push to the very end but the cheering onlookers provided the much needed encouragement with gusto.Caroline MacNabb led the team in with a gutsy run. She went out strongly and kept pushing to keep in contention. This earned her eighth overall in . and should encourage her that her consistent training is paying off.Catherine OrsquoConnor not far behind was forced to work hard for her tenth place coming home in  minutes exactly. This placed her first in her age category.Further back the rest of the team were all putting in the hard yards and finished in the following order: Sharon Madine , Wendy Findlay , Maureen Kelly and Janine Murray, who spent the entire race neck and neck, crossed the line together in ., Roisin Gaffney , Alison Carroll , Shauna McGreevyand Rachel Madine .Wayne Giles smiling as always placed nine  veteran men.The women had no time to relax as they took on the supporting role to pay back the shouts given by the EDAC men earlier. The men had an even bigger team.This level of participation is a sign of the numbers currently attending training. The club has definitely bounced back post Covid- and the enthusiasm to race is ing.Neil McCartan was out to show that his recent speedy . for K was no fluke so he was gunning for action.He along with a bunch of sharp shooters came out of the pens at a rate of knots, fighting to get away from the melee and make sure that they were not impeded in any way.Aaron McGrady also close to the front at the start was determined not to get sucked into a chase situation but found it hard to stay controlled when he saw the way the pack was breaking up.Neil ended up having to run solo as the top three were hammering on but to his credit he stayed solid and claimed a worthy fth place finishing in . for K.Aaron settled as per plan and worked his way through the field each lap ending up ninth overall .Gordy Graham wasnrsquot a fan of cross country before and hadnrsquot changed his opinion after but still managed to come th in ..The rest of the team streamed in not far behind.Neil Curran , Conaill MacNabb , Martin Willcox , Jonny Holmes , Barrie Atkinson , Dee Murray , Mark OrsquoConnor , Eamon Holmes , Seamus Savageand John Taylor .Cross country is definitely a dferent kettle of fish from a road race and many found that the iation in terrain made for an interesting outing while others found it an extremely hard session.The truth is that cross country is the most valuable way to pass the winter as it adds strength and stamina and the camaraderie almost makes up for the pain.Hopefully the turnout at Ballyclare in a couple of weeks time will show that that our members have been convinced of the merits.Declan Teague is continuing to push himself by completing multiple marathons in a short time frame.This weekend he headed to Kildare for his third crack at the . miles in five weeks. EDAC was well represented as Phillip Vint, completing his th marathon, and Dermot Cahill were also on the start list for the Thoroughbred Autumn Marathon.They had taken part in this event before but on a two lap route. This time it was one lap which was ldquotough enough according to Declan.He described it as rolling countryside and said that it felt like there was more up than down, with a bit of a headwind for good measure.On a positive note there were many plus points such as welcome sunshine and blue skies, plenty of support along the road, a great t-shirt and medal and best of all chicken curry at the finish.No wonder they recommend this race. All three men were pleased with their run. Declan set himself a target of : and worked hard up to  miles to give himself a cushion for the inevitable slowing after miles.His strategy worked well as he completed in three hours  minutes. Phillip Vint ran a commendable three hours  showing no repercussions from his recent efforts in the London Marathon and Dermot Cahill was pleased to lead the trio home in three hours .They were th, th and st respectively out of the  entries. A great showing on behalf of the club.Sam Anderson headed for Shanersquos Castle for the Championship Half Marathon to make the most of the long miles of training that she has put in for the recent Belfast full marathon.She might also have thought that she was escaping the mud of the cross country as the two events coincided.She was wrong though as overnight rain had left the estate very mucky and their mud was mixed with manure so it was a very smelly, sludgy . miles for Sam.With her usual stoicism, she coped with the adversity and came home smiling in two hours .On Sunday, the junior cross-country season got off with a bang at Billy Neill playing fields in Comber.It was the NI and Ulster Even Age Group Championships and there was a massive entry at all ages. Memories of the horrendous weather the last time it was hosted two years ago were still fresh in everyonersquos minds but it couldnrsquot have been more dferent.The sun shone, the wind was light and the ground was dry even though it had poured the night before.The East Down AC junior entry list was depleted over the days beforehand for a number of reasons but in the end the club had eight runners in five races.The runners were in age categories U-, U-, U-, U- and U- based on their age before the end of December .Luke Napier was first up running in the U- boys racewith his sister Cara running in the U- girls racejust after.Cara was also the clubrsquos only female junior running. This was their first race at this level and although they found the pace tough going they really enjoyed it and were excited to be part of an Ulster race with runners from all parts.Luke came nd out of  runners, the biggest junior field on the day, and Cara came th out of  runners.Alex Robinson, Finn Gibney and Freddie Ferguson were next with ,m in the U- boysrsquo race. As always the start was a mad stampede.As with the Napiers, Alex and Freddie were young in their category and it was Freddiersquos first race of this scale.At the finish Alex said he went off too hard but despite this he managed to come th out of  runners. Finn came th and Freddie st.As the runners get older the distance increases and so it was a tough ,m which faced the U- boys.Jacob Crawford and Oliver Robinson have been training hard over the last few months under the watchful eye of their coaches and race tactics were much discussed before the race.Ollie likes to lead from the front but was given strong advice to sit with the pack. He wasnrsquot surethat helped when he got hemmed in on the first shorter lap of the course in the big leading bunch.Jacob was wisely sat close to Ollie but managed to stay out of trouble. The U- race was the first to include a bigger lap which started with a long uphill section.Thankfully the wind was behind them for part of the lap as it had picked up a bit. This was Jacobrsquos first XC race for EDAC and he did the club proud coming th out of  runners.Ollie was just behind in th place with a sprint finish after struggling with a stitch for over half of the race. Last up for the juniors was MacKenzie Murray in the ,m U- boys race.He stayed resolute with the tough competition and came rd out of  runners. The standard at the age groups is high so all the EDAC Juniors should be proud of how they performed.As well as medals and podiums on the day, runners are seeking qualication for the All-Irelands either as an inidual or via slots based on the placing of their club or county.It is fantastic that as a result of their efforts that Alex Robinson and Finn Gibney , Jacob Crawford and Ollie Robinsonand Mackenzie Murrayhave all qualied to run for the County Down team in Santry Dublin on November .This All-Ireland event will literally take them to another level and is an exciting achievement.

work to repair Shrigley clock  ","story":"FRESH appeals have been issued for the restoration of the historic Shrigley clock, with Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey urged to step in to help put the tick back in the ageing structure.Owned by the Housing Executive, the Martin Memorial clock dates back to the Victorian era, with ious calls made over many decades for it to be restored to its former glory.The latest politicians to throw their weight behind the campaign are Strangford MLAs Michelle McIlveen and Harry Harvey who, in addition to raising the issue with Ms Hargey, have contacted Housing Executive chief executive Grainia Long.The housing body is responsible for the clock which had its bell and interior mechanism removed over three decades ago and placed in storage.Many are concerned to see the historic landmark falling into disrepair, but hopeful that it can be restored to be enjoyed for generations to come to reinforce its connection with the villagersquos industrial past.Shrigley was founded by the Martin family, who came from Pott Shrigley in Cheshire in  and who owned the spinning factory in the village.It was powered by water supplied from the nearby Clea Lough and while the mill mdash which is reported to have employed  people at one time mdash has long gone, the clock tower erected by the people of Shrigley in  in honour of the Martin family remains.Ms McIlveen mdash who is also the current Stormont education minister mdash said the clock which enjoys protected status and is one of the last remaining pieces of Victorian architecture in the village.She said while full restoration could be very expensive, there is a need to focus on what can be done in the interim to prevent further deterioration of the clock.ldquoIt is unacceptable that an old clock of this signicance and splendour should be allowed to fall into such a sad state of repair, she declared.Ms McIlveen said that previously, funding was provided for a conservation management plan by the Department for Communities Historic Environment Division which was developed on behalf of the Follies Trust.She said the report found that it would cost almost pound, to fully restore the Shrigley clock tower, a cost which the Housing Executive was unwilling to meet.Ms McIlveen and Mr Harvey said they have written to the housing body to not only highlight its public responsibility to maintain this listed property in its possession, but stressed the importance of the monument to the people of Shrigley:ldquoMonuments such as these are an important snapshot of our history and part of the fabric of our built heritage which should be cherished and protected said Ms McIlveen.ldquoWe have asked chief executive Grainia Long to outline what measures can be put in place ahead of a full restoration of the clock.The MLAs added: ldquoWhile I appreciate that full renovation works might be extremely expensive, it is very important that further deterioration of the monument does not occur.In a response to the Strangford Assembly members, Ms Long confirmed the clock is owned by the Housing Executive and sits on land transferred to it in the early s by the local council.She continued: ldquoThe condition of the monument has been raised with us and other agencies on a number of occasions and I can assure you that I appreciate the interest in our plans for it. ldquoHowever, while we have recently undertaken minor works to de-weed the monument and address any potential health and safety issues, it is our position that, at a time at which we have a signicant funding shortfall for investment in our tenantsrsquo homes, it would not be appropriate to use income derived from rents to fund the considerable costs that would be required to undertake a full restoration.The Housing Executive chief executive said that over the years, the organisation has explored options with others to secure the restoration and long-term sustainability of the monument but that these had proved unsuccessful.However, Ms Long said the Executive remains open to speaking to any interested parties and looking at any proposals.She added: ldquoThe establishment of a trust or the monumentrsquos disposal to, for example, a heritage organisation appear to be the best long-term courses of action and we would be happy to discuss these again with Newry, Mourne and Council and others..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27October2021_vandals.jpg","title":"Vandals target special school  ","story":"A SPECIAL

Cathy Mason mdash who have appealed to anyone who knows those involved in anti-social behaviour to contact police mdash say the trouble must stop.Cllr Lewis, the current PCSP chairman, has appealed to young people to stay away from Knockevin school and the nearby church. He said teenagers who are not a ldquopositive part of the Castlewellan community should remain at home.He visited the school last week where a Halloween party was in full swing and revealed he was disappointed to learn of further incidents of anti-social behaviour.ldquoOnce again, youths had entered the school grounds, climbed on the roof and attempted to remove led, with drug paraphernalia and empty medication packets also found, confirmed Cllr Lewis.ldquoMembers of St Paulrsquos Church leaving a service found empty pill boxes littering the area outside. The fact that a service was taking place did not put these people off and the mentality and lack of respect which is being shown is shocking beyond reason.Cllr Lewis said empty packets of Pregabalin are routinely found at the school and church and warned those who consume them are potentially at risk from blackouts or death.He added: ldquoThere is a fear that over Halloween that the anti-social behaviour will intensy and we hope that does not happen. I will be working with local council staff, police, youth workers and colleagues to ensure the Halloween period is quiet and appeal for a no-nonsense approach to this issue.Cllr Howell she and Cllr Mason recently visited the new school to welcome staff, pupils and parents to the Castlewellan community.ldquoI was deeply disappointed when contacted by the school last week to learn about the anti-social behaviour taking place in the grounds. In one incident, vandalism caused to the property led to the closure of the building, she confirmed.ldquoI am disappointed and frustrated that a small number of youths are causing these issues to a special school. I know first-hand the work and commitment that is put in to delivering the curriculum to the Knockevin children.Confirming that she and her colleague have raised these issues with the PSNI and asked for increased patrols in the vicinity of the school, Cllr Howell said she has also been liaising with Education Authority outreach workers and the PCSP to ensure everything possible is being done to alleviate the ongoing trouble.ldquoNo school should have to face these issues and I would ask for the wider community to be vigilant and report any activity of this nature to police as soon as they become aware of it, she added.Describing the Castlewellan trouble as ldquocompletely unacceptable, Cllr Mason said it will not be tolerated by the community in Castlewellan which is a safe and pleasant place to live.She added: ldquoThe management of the school have reported incidents such as underage drinking, damage to electrics and a satellite dish and roof tiles being broken, along with drug paraphernalia being left on the ground and a multitude of rubbish.ldquoStaff are understandably concerned about the potential risk to pupilsthey were to find any of these items, as well as the potential risk to the youths themselves on top of a school building..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27October2021_hinch.jpg","title":"Victory for ‘Hinch men  ","story":"THIS Intermediate League game started at a fast pace, with both teams wanting to retain possession.Although CI got the ball into the Hinch , the home side showed some great defending and quickly cleared the danger.Hinch continued to display some skilful hockey passing the ball around the back from Andrew Mulholland, Ray Coffey to either Ashley Brown or Craig Harkness on the wings.This enabled Hinch to tactically move the ball up the pitch, allowing Matthew Martin to have a shot on goal.Unfortunately, it went wide hitting the side of the goal while, at the other end, Aaron Donnell was on form in nets, saving any balls getting through the strong defence.During play, Coffey was able to find the back of the net, unfortunately he was just slightly outside the CI circle.The second quarter began with the Hinch men in defensive mode and able to keep the ball out of the net.As time progressed, they settled into the game and pushing the ball up the pitch towards Martin and Adam Dodds while there was some great passing across the back from Mulholland to Harkness across to Brown.The latter was able to work the ball up the pitch, passing to Jason Campbell who saw the opportunity to knit the ball across the CI goal, to be tapped in by the prolic Alex Millar.Quarter three began with Hinch gaining the first of several penalty corners, although were unable to break though the CI defence. aEnd to end play continued with each team determined to score.

What a damp squib the centenary has been as the organisers appear to have been more concerned to avoid offending nationalists than to offer anything bold or positive. Of course it was never going to be possible to avoid offending nationalism, which likes nothing better than an opportunity to wallow in historical grievances and has seized on the centenary as an opportunity to tell us all about the ‘great wrong’ of ‘partition’ and how it is the source of all our problems.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Does unionism today really lack the confidence publicly to defend, never mind celebrate Northern Ireland and to challenge the nationalist view  Why hasn’t the centenary been used to remind people that ‘partition’ was not an imposition on nationalists by unionists, but a compromise between nationalism and unionism  One hundred years ago there were two equally valid and equally determined assertions of self-determination: granting independence to nationalist-majority Ireland and allowing unionist-majority Ireland to remain in the UK was the obvious and most reasonable solution that satisfied a majority of both peoples.The nationalists’ ‘solution’ was for their self-determination entirely to override that of unionists: a victory rather than a compromise. That would have been the great wrong. Where is the unionist articulation of this narrative  Where is the appreciation that Northern Ireland facilitated generations of British people on this island to remain as citizens of the United Kingdom, and to continue to play a role and contribute to the le of the UK, not least in our contribution to the war against Nazism  Where is the reminder that — until the s— people in Northern Ireland enjoyed higher living standards than those in the Republic, greater access to secondary and tertiary education, better public services, and were spared the oppressive censorship and social conservatism of the South  Where is the celebration of the successful determination of a proud people to retain their membership of the UK and withstand the attempt to coerce them into another state against their clear will  J.

Mr McKee, a Christian, said that “conservative values are being squeezed out” in favour of candidates and members who “without exception, endorse same-sex marriage and abortion”.It is entirely understandable that Mr Beattie is trying hard to win back liberal votes from Alliance.

Conservative positions on these matters are still very widely held across the community, but you would hardly know that from public discourse.We report today on troubling plans to take severe legislative measures against gay conversion therapy in England and Wales. Is the practice really so prevalent as to need such penalties  How will a law change affect the right of people to seek traditional Christian support and guidance on sexuality issues  Mr McKee says his Christianity “increases the care I have for others” and drives his politics. Such a comment is unfashionable but reflects thinking that was mainstream for centuries. People across the religious ide will admire his faith and commitment and candour.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

What’s it been like working with her “It’s completely dferent,” says Riley. “We used to all be in the same room together but because of coronavirus everyone’s off separately having their make-up done so we don’t see each other as much. We’ve not really done much team bonding.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Rachel with her now husband Pasha Kovalev during rehearsals for Strictly Come Dancing in “Obviously, we had  years with Nickand we really knew each other. Sheis a completely dferent character.”For now, the -year-old maths whizz is understandably much more focused on motherhood. Her Russian husband Pasha Kovalev, erstwhile dance partner from Strictly in , has been fantastic with their toddler daughter, Maven, who turns two in December.“He’s the best dad in the world,” Riley beams. “He’s amazingly patient and will let me sleep in in the morning and look after her when I’ve been up working late.“He’s taken to being a dad like a duck to water. And Maven looks just like him. He goes to the soft play, the bouncy castle and the park – then I get home and he’s made dinner!”Rachel Riley has decided to remind us all how to ide and conquer once more, mostly by mastering long ision, fractions and alegbraThe presenter started dating Kovalev after orcing her husband, Jamie Gilbert, who was a fellow Oxford University student, in .Today, she is clearly still besotted with her professional dancer other half. “He’s the most unique person I’ve ever met. He’s such a chilled, calming influence. Nothing fazes him.”She’s planning to have her second baby at homeand isn’t intending on going on a massive drive toto her pre-pregnancy weight quickly.“I’ll be breastfeeding, so you need the calories. If you are losing it really quickly it just means you are probably not giving your baby what it needs. The weight comes off in its own time and I’ve got a whole range of dresses ready in dferent sizes for when I go back to work.”She’s still breastfeeding Maven, although she hopes that will subside in the New Year, and hopes to be back at work in January, she says.“When you have a newborn, and especially when you have a toddler as well, you don’t have time for a shower. So when I get back to work someone will be paid to do my hair and make-up. You don’t recognise yourself the first time you go back because you’ve just been in mum mode and haven’t washed your hair for a while.”She and her family live in London and also have an apartment in Manchester, where Countdown is filmed. Kovalev will look after the children while Riley is working on the show, taking the baby in for breastfeeding when she’s on a break.They don’t want any more children after the new baby, she says.“We only want two. You can fit two in the car, that kind of stuff. It was a maths decision,” she says, laughing.They married in Las Vegas in  when she was pregnant with Maven, she recalls.“My friend was taking a sabbatical in the States. She said she was going to Vegas and askedI wanted to come to see Robbie Williams. We said, great. Then, when I was four months pregnant, just before the trip, Pasha said, ‘Shall we get married next week ’ We found a little chapel and I bought my dress the day before the wedding.”This year Riley has written At Sixes And Sevens, a maths book for adults, featuring tips and tricks on how to navigate your way through the minefield of equations, formulas, fractions, algebra and BODMAS , among other conundrums.“I’ve always enjoyed making maths accessible and trying to demysty it, even when I was at school,” she says.Her acumen is clearly rubbing off. “My daughter has already started counting on her hands, one, two, three,” she enthuses. “And she can do it in Russian as well.”Riley, who grew up in Essex, studied maths at Oxford University and clinched the Countdown job pretty soon afterwards. As a top maths scholar, did she ever feel her brain could be better utilised than it is on a popular show “I enjoy what I do,” she says simply. “Being on TV has afforded me lots of opportunities and I’m lucky I get to use my maths background as an advocate for maths and science and numeracy.“Through programmes like It’s Not Rocket Science I get to meet people who want to break the land speed record with the fastest car in the world, I got to interview Tim Peake. I’ve got the background to give me enough confidence to interview these people.”For now though, she is having to take things a bit easier. While knowing that sleep deprivation is coming with the new arrival, she is trying to enjoy her Friday night treat – episodes of Ted Lasso, supporting Manchester Utd , going to the park and meeting friends and family.Riley and Kovalev don’t watch Strictly these days, but do keep in touch with some of her old Strictly cohorts, Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Deborah Meaden, and a while ago they went to Majorca to see Brendan Cole and his family.And though she might feel tired right now, Riley is also planning an energetic future for when she is ready: “Once I’m back on my feet, I’ll be ready for a new challenge,” she says.Thanks to Rachel you can master long ision and fractions once moreOn Countdown, Rachel famously replaced the long-serving fellow maths wizard Carol Vorderman. Like Vorderman, Riley’s role is to handle the placement of tiles on the board for the letters and numbers rounds and to find an exact solution in the numbers roundsthe contestants are unable to do so.Riley’s appointment to Countdown was announced at the same time as new main host Jeff Stelling replaced Des O’Connor the duo of Stelling and Riley was in place for the new series beginning in January .Although she had never had any ambition to become a television presenter, Rachel was encouraged to apply for the show by her mother, and decided to do so because she was interested in the numbers part of the game. Having beaten , applicants for the role, she said: “There’s only one cool maths job around and I was lucky enough to get it so I’m absolutely thrilled”.Since it was first broadcast on January , , Riley has also performed her Countdown role on the comedy crossover spin-off version,  Out of  Cats Does Countdown, alongside comedian and host Jimmy Carr, team masters Susie Dent and Jon Richardson and a revolving door of guest stars including Bob Mortimer, David Mitchell, Richard Aoyade and other comedy greats of our time. While Countdown is seen as a straight light entertainment show, in explaining the dference between the two, Riley sees Countdown as the role she is “happy for her grandmother to see”, while Cats Does Countdown is the more risqué, cheeky role which she shows to her friends.Her new book, At Sixes and Sevens, is described as “an engaging, accessible introduction into how numbers work and why we shouldn’t be afraid of them.”It’s designed for those of us who don’t know our fractions from our percentages, or what is adjacent to the hypotenuse on a triangle or exactly how to help your offspring with long ision since those brain cells very likely perished long ago.According to the blurb: “You won’t be At Sixes and Sevens for long. In this brilliant, well-rounded guide, Rachel Riley will take you back to the very basics, allow you to revisit what you learnt at school , build your understanding of maths from the get-go and provide you with the essential toolkit to gain confidence in your numerical abilities.”Sounds like a tome the less numerically literate could definitely benefit from reading -though flashbacks from the agony of double maths at school may ensue.At Sixes And Sevens by Rachel Riley is published by HarperCollins, priced £..Maven  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most Popular‘A far cry from the party of Carson’: UUP man launches broadside against Doug Beattie as he quits party in protest over lean towards liberalismOwen Polley: Unconvincing poll was twisted by pundits to support the Northern Ireland ProtocolTributes paid to ex-Ulster and Ireland rugby international David TweedSandra Chapman would have been better to give away her £ high street voucherThe unionist approach to Northern Ireland’s centenary has been a pathetic concession to the Irish nationalist narrativeMost PopularNI High Street Voucher: How long can it take to get spend local card and what to doyou havent received itFormer Ulster and Ireland rugby player David Tweed dies in motorbike crashBryson: DUP will collapse Stormont on two conditionsTrial scheme in which councils will give people free money takes step closerWe probe Irish nationalist myths in our new book, which defends Northern Ireland and the Union                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt records  rail journeys across Britain taken mainly on branch lines in  and .The writer is very descriptive of not just the journey and the people he met, but also the history of the lines he is writing about.Itrsquos very nostalgic and brought back memories of steam engines and their heyday.I grew up near a mainline and can recall being in bed as a child hearing the engines chugging away from a nearby signal.This made me a trainspotter as a boy and I remember being allowed on the footplate of a steam engine in Cardf General Stationand being amazed at the controls the driver used to move the engine and the heat generated from the firebox.This was in the last days of steam and even now the memory is still vivid. I think this is why my we and I enjoy a nostalgic steam journey when we visit an area with a preserved railway, which we did recently.Although more modern engines are more efficient and cleaner, they seem to me to not have the raw power of a steam locomotive and particularly those that used to haul express trains.This book has made me think of the power we need to live in our journey of le.There may seem to be more modern ways of living with many ideas offered, but the nothing beats the power of God.It may seem old fashioned and nostalgic to think like this, but when I see Godrsquos power at work all other efforts pale into insignicance.The Bible shows Godrsquos power with Jesus healing people, raising the dead and feeding large crowds among other things.It was supremely shown when He died and rose again which is central to the Christian faith.That power is still at work today with countless lives changed when people have an encounter with Jesus and see His power at work on their behalf.We all need help in the journey of le and God is always there for us.May I suggest that we do what The Bible says this week:\"Ask where the good way is, and walk in it and you will find rest for your souls\"PhilipGet involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have had great success with online bridge during the pandemic, but now we have reopened for Face-to-Face bridge our numbers are too small to be viable.Please come and support this historic club. However, letrsquos be positive. We are exploring merging our Tuesday and Friday evening sessions with another club.And,all fails, we will resume online bridge. Penarth Bridge Club will live on!So, here is a recent hand played at a Face-to-Face session where careful judgment by both declarer and the defence were required to achieve the optimum result.The AuctionNorth had seven spades and just seven points, ideal for a pre-emptive opening of three spades. The aim of pre-emptive bids is to put a spanner in the wheel of the defence.However, the danger always is that, as here, your partner has a good hand and so has a dficult decision to make on whether to pass or bid on for game. After some thought, South could see at least six spade tricks, evenhis partner did not have the king of spades.There were also two certain heart tricks, and it ought to be possible to rustle up a trick in diamonds and one more from Northrsquos hand. So, South bid four spades.The playTrick  ndash East was on lead and did not fancy a diamond or a club. And the jack of hearts lead was fraught with danger. So, interestingly, East chose to lead the five of spades, reasoning that his king was safe for a trickNorth held the ace.And evenSouth held three spades to the ace, North must surely have an entry somewhere to take the spade finesse. Anyway, declarer paused to consider the hand.Without the trump lead the contract would have been secure as he could have ruffed a losing club in dummy. But now things were dficult.North decided to play the ace of spades, hoping to drop a singleton king in Westrsquos hand. But no luck. Tricks  and  ndash Declarer then played a club to his ace, followed by a small club from hand, the trick being won by Eastrsquos king.East was now quite pleased he had decided to lead a trump at the first trick. Trick  - East won the next trick with the king of spades, preventing declarer from ruffing his losing club.Trick  ndash East then led his ace of diamonds, which was ruffed by declarer in hand. Trick  ndash Declarer drew Eastrsquos last trump with his queen, discarding a heart from dummy. But he could now see he still had a losing club and a losing heart, one down, having already lost two tricks.But could there be a squeeze on  Tricks , ,  and  ndash Declarer then rattled off his last four spades, forcing four discards from both East and West. East could see that dummy had to discard before West, so he jettisoned his remaining four diamonds, keeping the jack of clubs and two hearts.Declarer decided to discard one more heart and the rest of dummyrsquos diamonds. West had to hope his partner East held the jack of clubs, otherwise he was genuinely squeezed. So, he discarded the rest of his clubs, keeping his three hearts to the queen.Declarer then played a small heart to dummyrsquos ace. He followed this with the king of hearts. Bad luck, Eastrsquos jack dropped but not Westrsquos queen. Trick  - West then won the last trick with his queen of hearts, declarer only making nine tricks - six spades, two hearts, and one club, one down for a loss of  points.Four spades was a perfectly reasonable bid by South. But well done by the defence for the opening lead and care in their discards.What have we learnt . areful judgement is needed when responding to partnerrsquos opening pre-emptive bid, particularly when non vulnerable, since the pre-emptive bid is likely to be quite weak.. Sometimes it can quite be safe to lead a trump from three to king, as here.Penarth club resultsFriday  October: . Joy Seculer and Mike Downey. Peter Craig and Sean Macdougall.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
