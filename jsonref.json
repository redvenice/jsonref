Michael GoveEnvironment SecretaryOdds: 161 Creation of a \u0027smart pro-business economic plan\u0027, including scrapping VAT and bring in a lower sale tax to stimulate business following Brexit, cutting taxes and business rates and review competition law.He has not ruled out seeking a further delay to Brexit - possibly for months beyond October 31 - if a deal is in reach, and warned pursuing a no-deal scenario could lead to a general election in which Jeremy Corbyn could enter Number 10. Michael Gove was repeatedly challenged over his cocaine confession today as he battles to get his Tory leadership bid back on track.Mr Gove used his campaign launch this afternoon to insist he had \u0027acknowledged his mistake\u0027 and stress his record of helping others find \u0027redemption\u0027 and \u0027second chances\u0027.He insisted he was the \u0027serious\u0027 candidate to take over from Theresa May, and took a series of swipes at Boris Johnson.

Go Home or Risk Arrest\u0027  written on the sides, which drove around London targeting immigrants.And he was forced to resign from that post in 2014 after discovering that he had been personally employing a cleaner who did not have the right to work int he UK.    "},{"url":null,"title":"John Lewis moves construction industry offer customers home extensions","story":"Share this article By contrast John Lewis, which is owned by its staff, has a reputation as a trusted business charging fair prices.

The call for an end to the misuse of non-disclosure agreements – deals in which workers who complain are paid off in return for agreeing to stay quiet – was made by the Commons’ women and equalities select committee yesterdayThree Appeal judges ruled that any publication of his name and the nature of the complaints should be suppressed as to do so would break NDAs which the staff had signed. They had told their stories to the Daily Telegraph. But shortly afterwards, former Labour Cabinet minister Lord Hain named him in the Lords under protection of Parliamentary privilege.In February, a judge disclosed Sir Philip had spent more than £1million paying lawyers in the case and faced costs of £3million. And over recent months, he has been facing fresh problems. Last week, he hired a top US lawyer to fight claims he ked pilates instructor Katie Surridge up to ten times at the Canyon Ranch retreat in Tucson, Arizona, in 2016.

When they arrived at the Rosen Inn International in Orlando they were told that their rooms were not booked out for them for another two days.The family feared the worst, but the hotel allowed them to stay overnight if they paid £100 each per family for a room - which they were hoping to redeem if they could sort the situation out with the holiday reps before 10am the next day. Mr Williams said: \u0027We just want some answers. It was disgusting. My wife, my children, my mother-in-law - all they did was cry. It was horrible. That night at reception, not knowing if we had a room, the kids were really scared. They were also knackered.\u0027 The family complained about the rooms which they said were covered in dust, with blood on the bedsheets.           As well as having to share beds, the family found blood stains on the sheets (pictured above) For the Williams family, and the others, the situation was far from ideal.There were just two three-quarter sized beds in the shared room. This meant their 12-year-old daughter Alise, Ruby, seven, and Oliver, five, had to share one bed.What exacerbated matters was that the original hotel the families had been booked into, which was changed before the holiday because of potential noise issues, was a self-catering suite, but the hotel rooms the families were staying in had minimal facilities, which meant they had to eat out more often.         The family complained about the state of their hotel room, and said there was dust on the floor (above) Mr Williams said he thought that added another £1,500 to the cost of his immediate family\u0027s holiday.He said the first couple of days were spent trying to sort out the issue with the holiday reps, who were very helpful at the resort. But that meant they missed out on the first days of their two-week pass to the Disney attraction.Eventually the family was given a temporary bed for the room. The representatives also provided the families with vouchers for activities, but they found out those were generally available elsewhere anyway.An attempt to be moved to another hotel failed, as they were told all the similar hotels were booked up.But the final straw was when the families were coming to the end of their holidays and found out they should have had vouchers to cover their breakfast, but these hadn\u0027t been provided and they had paid for their breakfasts. A Thomas Cook spokeswoman said: \u0027We\u0027re very sorry for the inconvenience caused to... all the family at the beginning of their trip to Florida. We recognise we made a mistake with the hotel booking and we\u0027re investigating the issues raised. In resort, we did everything we could to try and put things right, including offering meal vouchers. We have contacted Mrs Hibbs and we hope to be able to resolve this.\u0027After the initial mix-up with the accommodation Thomas Cook said no further complaint was made in resort. On May 20 the customers complained to Morgan Travel, not Thomas Cook direct. "},{"url":null,"title":"Hunter talks 250lb black bear tree platform wants use","story":"          First-time hunter Bryan Reber arrives at his post to find a black bear perched at the top of the platformIncredibly, the bear seemed to understand Bryan\u0027s concerns and in less than a minute, climbed down the ladder and disappeared into the trees.The video footage shows Mr Reber saying to the bear: \u0027Hey, that\u0027s my tree stand.

And Cook\u0027s diminutive comedy partner, Dudley Moore.The pair would pace round the garden writing sketches, trying out jokes and, increasingly, rubbing each other up the wrong way as Moore sought Hollywood success while Cook embraced a quiet life with triple vodka and orange for breakfast.It was at a Perrin\u0027s Walk party that a dripping wet Cook greeted his guests by explaining he had just jumped into the koi carp pond after setting his trousers on fire while lighting candles.         Perrins Walk is a charming private mews and is perfectly located for the Hampstead Village lifestyle, according to a recent listing         Dudley Moore and Peter Cook standing in the backyard of the famous party house Cook\u0027s daughters Daisy and Lucy, from his first wife Wendy, occasionally lent a hand. \u0027I remember asking Keith Richards what he\u0027d like to drink. \u0027Whisky!\u0027 he commanded,\u0027 Daisy said. \u0027As I returned with a glass, he looked at me blankly and said: \u0027I meant a bottle.\u0027When an admiring Ronnie Wood asked his host who the waitress was, Cook sharply responded: \u0027That\u0027s my daughter — hands off!\u0027Cook himself welcomed a steady stream of women. Indeed, it was here, hidden in a suitcase upstairs in the master bedroom, that second wife Judy Huxtable spied on her husband, trying to catch him in flagrante.If she\u0027d been pushed to the edge, it was no surprise. For Cook had a voracious appetite for women and was not the sort to let a little detail like wives — three of them, to be precise — get in the way of a bit of extracurricular fun.         Peter Cook and his wife Judy Huxtable.

And Cook\u0027s diminutive comedy partner, Dudley Moore (pictured together)Over the years, he bedded a vast array of beauties including President J.F. Kennedy\u0027s wife, Jackie, and her sister, Lee Radziwill.When famous women such as Germaine Greer visited, he would flirt furiously. He also whisked Hollywood actress Raquel Welch and Bond Girl Ursula Andress out for the evening, leaving poor old Judy shell-shocked, at home.Peter Cook, the son of an economics adviser to the government, was brilliant, funny and original.He was at Cambridge at the same time as future Tory grandees Michael Howard, Leon Brittan and Kenneth Clarke and knew them all vaguely.\u0027They were all so self-important at 20, that you\u0027d have thought they\u0027d have grown out of it. But no . . .\u0027 he said.

For two decades, everything they did shone. Their sketch revue, Beyond The Fringe, with Alan Bennett and Jonathan Miller, was a hit on both sides of the Atlantic. Cook and Moore then cemented their partnership with the BBC TV series Not Only . . . But Also.They were superstars who slept with endless women and, in Cook\u0027s case, drank far too much.They finally went their separate ways after a world tour in 1974. Moore was drawn to the Hollywood lights, while Cook headed back to Hampstead where two years\u0027 mail awaited. He refused to open any of it.In fact, he never opened any mail ever again. Instead, he focused on a life of shambolic indolence punctuated by lavish parties. With the royalties pouring in from 20 years of performances, he didn\u0027t need to work — and that was fine by him. He was, he once said, \u0027born to be on holiday\u0027.

But he quickly started a relationship with Lin Chong, who worked as a secretary for Lownes and lived just 200 yards from Cook. She took one look at the state of his house and decided they should be a \u0027two-home\u0027 couple. In turn, he promised to limit his lovers to his two favourite girlfriends. Somehow they made it work.Cook adored his home and spent a lot of time in his sitting room, reading every newspaper, chatting with his neighbour, George Weiss, who recorded hundred of hours of their meandering conversations.At night, he\u0027d call radio stations, putting on different personas. For two years, for example, he managed to fool thousands of listeners by calling a phone-in show pretending to be a Norwegian fisherman called Sven who was pining for his fish.But there were terrible lows. In 1986 he was given a car for his birthday and promptly crashed it into a police car while over the limit. The following year, he ended up in a newspaper kiss-and-tell story by a former girlfriend, alleging group sex at Weiss\u0027s house.          Keith Richards, Peter Cook (1937 - 1995), Ronnie Wood, Dudley Moore (1935 - 2002), and Dave Stewart at the release party for the uncut version of \u0027Derek and Clive Get the Horn\u0027Meanwhile, his daily drinking escalated to three bottles of wine, a bottle of vodka and numerous glasses of strong lager a day.No one seemed to mind, because the drunker he got, the funnier he became. Of course, his health suffered.Many people said he\u0027d failed to fulfil his potential. But he didn\u0027t care. For Cook was utterly uninterested in projecting the \u0027right\u0027 image, claiming that he lost all ambition by the age of 24.\u0027I might have some regrets but I can\u0027t remember what they are,\u0027 he famously commented.After he died, Lin finally moved into Perrin\u0027s Walk — and couldn\u0027t bear to change a thing.

The title translates literally from the Portuguese as “malice”, but it carries too the echoes of the words “city” and “cursed”. Rio Branco grew up the son of a diplomat, citizen of the world and for half a century his camera has given him similar licence. Though earlier work, photo essays for National Geographic for example, focused on very specific communities – the young fighters of the Santa Rosa Boxing Academy in Rio de Janeiro or the prostitutes and street children of Salvador de Bahia – he has come to reject expected labelling of time and place.The photographs in Maldicidade are uncaptioned, drawn from a lifetime of wandering the backstreets of New York, Havana, Barcelona and beyond. Rio Branco looks for those contrasts between grimy decay and daily renewal that are the universal fascination of city life. This picture, of a tray of fresh pastries served under the open bonnet of a beaten-up car, depicts exactly the kind of incongruity that his camera waits for. The colour and sweetness of those cakes contrast with the greys of the car and the street.A film-maker and painter as well as a photographer, Rio Branco has been an associate of Magnum since the 80s, but his work is not in the photojournalistic tradition that the agency is most famous for. By focusing on thematic details, he says he wants to make his pictures transcend documentary and express what he sees as poetic constants: “Time, flesh, sexuality, decay, death.”The cars in his photographs, like this one, crashed or abandoned or rusted or scrapped, tell those stories just as surely as the faces and bodies of the city’s inhabitants.Maldicidade by Miguel Rio Branco is out on 12 June (Taschen, £60)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/899fcbcc3e66e82a824070726a36a5b9bc5cfc50/0_328_4572_2744/master/4572.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17bccdf5d91e700b488dff2551f4ae32","title":"philip pullman secret commonwealth extract book of dust","story":"Twenty-year-old Lyra has to flee Oxford by boat for the third time in her life, this time in the company of the old gyptian Giorgio Brabandt. As they sail towards the safety of the Fens, they hear a zeppelin approaching …As darkness was falling at the edge of the Fens, rain began to fall too. It was the time of day when Giorgio Brabandt usually began to look for a likely spot to moor for the night, but as they were so close to his native waters, he was inclined to keep moving. He knew every twist and turn of these mazy waterways, and the lights he sent Lyra to mount at the stem and the stern were a matter of courtesy to any fellow boaters, not a necessity to show the way.“When do we get into the Fens, Master B?” said Lyra.“We’re there now,” he said. “More or less. There en’t no frontier nor customs post, nothing like that. One minute you’re out, the next minute you’re in.”“So how do you know?”“You got a feeling for it. If you’re gyptian, it’s like coming home. If you en’t gyptian, you feel uncomfortable, nervous, you feel that all them boggarts and horrors is out there in the water, watching you. Don’t you feel that?”“Oh. Well we can’t be there yet. Or else I en’t told you enough stories.”He was standing at the tiller, in oilskins and sou’wester, while Lyra sat just inside the doorway wrapped in an old coat of his. The stern light threw a yellow outline around his bulky form, and lit up the incessant raindrops that filled the air. Lyra was aware of the potatoes cooking on the naphtha stove in the galley behind her she’d go in soon and cut some slices of bacon to fry.“When d’you think we’ll get to the Zaal?” she said.“Ah, there’s a way to tell that.”“When you’re close enough to see it, you’re almost there.”“Well, that’s helpful, I must—”He suddenly put up a hand to hush her, and at the same moment his dæmon looked up. Brabandt sheltered his eyes with the brim of his sou’wester and peered up too, and Lyra followed their example. She could see nothing, but heard a distant rumble from the upper air.“Lyra, run forrard and dowse that glim,” said Brabandt, easing the throttle back and reaching out with his other hand for the stern light.The light at the prow was reflected along the length of the cabin roof, so Lyra could see easily enough to run along and jump down. When she reached up and turned the wick down to extinguish the flame she could hear the sound more easily, and a moment later she could see the source of it: the pale egg-like form of a zeppelin, cruising slowly some way behind them on the starboard side, below the clouds, and showing no lights.She felt her way back to the cockpit. Brabandt had steered the Maid of Portugal in towards the side and cut the engine to a murmur. As Lyra jumped down she felt a little jolt as the boat touched the grassy bank.“You see it?” he said quietly.“I can see one. Are there more?”“One’s enough. Is it follerin us?”“No. I shouldn’t think they can have seen the lights yet, not through this rain. And the noise that engine is making, they’d never be able to hear ours.”“I’m going to move along then,” he said.He pushed the throttle forward, and the engine responded with a gentle rumble. The boat moved on.“How can you see?” said Lyra.“Instinct. Keep your trap shut. I need to listen.”She remembered the potatoes, and ran inside to take them off the stove and drain them. The warm, comfortable old cabin, the clean galley, the steam, the smell of the cooked potatoes – they felt like a bulwark against the danger above but she knew they were nothing of the sort, and that a bomb well aimed would kill her and Brabandt and sink the Maid in a matter of moments.She hurried from end to end of the boat, checking all the blinds. There wasn’t a single chink. Finally she extinguished the light in the galley and went out to the cockpit again.The roar of the zeppelin’s engine was loud now. It sounded as if it was directly overhead. She squinted up through the lashing rain, and could see nothing.“Psst,” said Brabandt quietly. “Look out starboard.”Lyra stood up and stared as hard as she could, ignoring the rain in her eyes, and this time saw a little flickering greenish light. It was inconstant, but it always came back, after vanishing for a second or two, and it was moving.“Is that another boat?” she said.A second light, reddish in colour, appeared and disappeared not far from the first. Lyra watched them approach each other, touching, disappearing, and then flickering up again a little way apart.The Maid of Portugal continued to move ahead, steady and slow, as Brabandt kept checking left and right, listening, peering, even lifting his face to sniff at the air. The rain was beating down harder than ever. The marsh lights seemed to be keeping pace with the boat, and then Lyra realised that the zeppelin overhead had moved a little in their direction, as if to see what they were. The engine sounded very loud, very close, and she wondered how the pilot could see anything at all in the murk. The boat was leaving no wake, and every light on board was out.A third light had joined the first two, and now they set up a weird halting, pausing, swerving dance. The cold inconstant glimmer made Lyra feel uneasy. Only the solid deck beneath her feet and the bulky presence of Giorgio Brabandt saved her from a sickly fear of things that were outside, just beyond the reach of reason, inhabiting the dark.“It’s going that way,” said Brabandt.He was right. As if it was being pulled, the zeppelin was moving to starboard, towards the marsh lights.Brabandt pushed the throttle further forward, and the narrow boat picked up speed. In the faint glimmer of the marsh lights Lyra could see him straining every sense, and Anneke his dæmon jumped up on to the cabin roof, head moving this way and that to catch a fragment of scent that would help avoid a mudbank or steer round a bend.Lyra almost said “Can I help?” but realised as she opened her mouth that if he had a task for her, he’d tell her. So she sat down in the doorway again and kept still, and looked out to starboard, where the marsh lights were flickering more brightly than ever.Suddenly a line of fire streaked down towards the marsh lights from the teeming sky above. It hit the water and exploded in a blossom of orange and yellow flame, and after a second Lyra heard the brief whistle of the flight and the solid crump of the explosion.The marsh lights went out all at once.“There,” said Brabandt. “They broke the law now. They’re allowed to fly over, but not to do that.”Anneke was growling as she stood four-square and gazed at the rapidly fading glow from the rocket.A moment later a dozen marsh lights flickered again, moving swiftly, darting here and there, even rising and falling. Little jets of fire spurted up from the ground, to flare and go out in a moment.The boat was still purring forward into the dark, but he was right: the marsh lights were so fierce and brilliant now that, small as they were, they illuminated the whole length of the Maid of Portugal, streaming with rain and catching every flicker of light.“They don’t like us, the will-o’-the-wykeses, but they like them zeppelins even less,” Brabandt said. “But they still don’t like us. Wouldn’t bother ’em a bit if we got sunk and drowned, or smashed into a thousand splinters.”Anneke barked, a short yap of alarm. She was looking up, and Lyra, following her gaze, saw a little shape falling from the zeppelin and briskly unfolding into a parachute. Almost at once the wind caught it and tossed it backwards, but then the black shape under the canopy burst into a brilliant flame.“Flares,” said Brabandt, as another fell, blossomed, and blazed.The response from the marsh lights was instant and furious. More and more of them flickered into being and leaped and danced towards the falling flare, and when it reached the water, they swarmed all over it, their cold fire mastering its heat and finally drowning it in a cloud of smoke and a chorus of wet little shrieks and sucking noises.Suddenly Lyra jumped up and ran inside, feeling her way along the length of the boat to her little cabin in the prow. She felt for her bunk, felt the bedside table, moved her hands over the book and the lamp until they found the velvet bag that held the alethiometer. With that safely in both hands she moved back through the boat, conscious of the little movements Brabandt was making with the wheel and the throttle, of the roar from the zeppelin’s engine somewhere above, of the moaning of the wind. From the galley she saw Brabandt at the tiller outlined against the flickering marsh lights, and then she was in the doorway again, and sat on the bench from where she could see out.“Yes. I’m going to see what I can find out.”She was already turning the little wheels of the alethiometer, and peering close in the intermittent glimmer to try and make out the symbols. But it was no good: they were more or less invisible. She held the instrument between her palms, and stared fiercely out at the flickering jacky-lanterns, aware of a powerful contradiction that almost tore her mind in two. What she wanted to do would involve this secret commonwealth of Brabandt’s, and yet she told herself it was nonsense, superstition, nothing but meaningless fancy.The zeppelin was turning around ahead of them, its searchlight probing the rain and the dark marsh gloom below it. Another minute or two, and it would be facing them, and once it had the Maid of Portugal fixed in the glare of the light, nothing would save them.Pan, Pan, Pan, Lyra thought, I need you now, you little bastard, you traitor.She tried to imagine gathering all the jacky-lanterns as if she was herding sheep, but it was so hard, because after all she had no imagination, as Pan had said. What would it be like to do that? She thought harder and harder. She thought of herself as a light-herd, and the absent Pan as a light-dog, racing from side to side across the marsh, crouching down still, leaping up again, barking short sharp commands, running where she thought him to.And how stupid, she thought, how childish. It’s just methane or something. It’s just natural, meaningless. Her concentration faltered.She heard a sob coming from her throat, completely against her will.Brabandt said, “What you doing, gal?”She ignored him. She gritted her teeth and summoned the absent Pan again, a hell-hound now, with glowing eyes and slaver flying from his lips, and she saw the terrified marsh lights fleeing and flocking and circling round as the zeppelin’s cold beam of light came closer and closer and she heard the drumming of rain on the great snout-prow of the aircraft, even over the wind and the roar of the engine.She felt something rising inside her, like a tide, wave upon wave of it, growing and receding and then growing again, a little more each time, and it was anger, it was desire, it was visceral.“What they doing? Good God – look at that … ” Brabandt was saying.The marsh lights were speeding and climbing, dashing again and again at a spot on the water just ahead of the zeppelin’s searchlight, and then with a shriek something rose out of the marsh that wasn’t a jacky-lantern nor a will-o’-the-wyke but a large bird, a heron or even a stork, heavy and white and terrified by the darting green glimmers that harried it up and up and into the beam of the searchlight, and higher still, snapping at its legs, crowding like hornets at its great hefty body as it lumbered up in fear and hurled itself at the aircraft—Brabandt said hoarsely, “Hold tight, gal.” The searchlight beam was nearly on them.Then in an explosion of fire and blood and white feathers, the heron flew straight into the port engine of the zeppelin.The aircraft lurched and swung to the left at once, and dipped and sagged as the starboard engine screamed and the great slug-shape drifted sideways and downwards. The tail heaved itself round, caught by the wind with no port engine to stabilise it, and the craft drifted down and down towards the swamp, and closer and closer to the Maid of Portugal, as if it were sinking on to a bed. Little scraps of sound, screams, cries, came whirling through the wind and were snatched away again. By the glow of the dancing marsh lights as well as the fire that was now blazing out of control from the zeppelin, she and Brabandt watched in horror as a figure, two, three, hurled themselves out of the cabin and fell down into the dark. A moment later the great broken shell of the zeppelin collapsed on to the water only fifty yards away from them, surrounded by clouds of steam, and smoke, and flame, and the dance of a thousand marsh lights, capering in triumph. The heat scorched Lyra’s face, and Brabandt tilted his sou’wester against it.It was horrible to watch, but she couldn’t look away. The skeleton of the airship showed black against the great blaze of light, and then it crumpled together and fell in with a cascade of sparks and smoke.“They won’t survive that, none of ’em,” said Brabandt. “They be all dead now.”He moved the throttle lever, and the boat moved out into the middle of the watercourse and gathered speed slowly.“That heron,” Lyra said shakily. “The marsh lights were chasing it. They made it fly up into the engine. They knew what they were doing.”And so did I, she thought. I made it happen.“A heron, was it? Might’ve been. I thought it was a flying boggart. They do fly, some of ’em, making a kind of a whirring noise. Only there was so much else going on we couldn’t a heard that. That’s probably what it was, a flying elf or a spirit out the waters. Summing from the secret commonwealth, what I told you about. Look at the jacky-lanterns, now.”The marsh lights, dozens of them, had all gathered around the burning wreck, making little darts towards it and out again, flickering and dancing.“What are they doing?”“Looking for any survivors. They’ll pull ’em down under the water and finish ’em off. Them potaters done yet?”“Well, don’t let ’em get cold. Tell you what, there’s a tin of bully beef in the locker. Chop it up with the potatoes and fry the lot. I’m getting peckish.”Lyra felt sick. She couldn’t help thinking of the dead men from the zeppelin, burned or drowned or worse, and of that beautiful white bird, driven up without mercy into the blades of the engine. Food was the last thing she wanted just then, but when the hash was cooking she found that after all, it was a shame to waste it, and it did smell good so she brought two plates of it to the cockpit, where Brabandt began by scooping up a forkful and dropping it over the side.“For the will-o’-the-wykes,” he said.Lyra did the same with hers, and then they ate their supper, sheltering their plates from the rain.• The Secret Commonwealth: The Book of Dust Volume Two will be published on 3 October by David Fickling Books in association with Penguin Random House.

But Aston Martin is the carmaker most closely associated with the fictional spy, and it is hoping its new SUV can cause as much of a stir as 007’s sleek sports cars.The first DBX will leave the production line at Aston Martin Lagonda’s new factory in St Athan, south Wales, in the first half of 2020, in a major departure for the British manufacturer as it tries to rapidly double its annual production numbers.The DBX, the brand’s first sports utility vehicle in its 106-year history, is part of a strategy by the chief executive, Andy Palmer, to bring the carmaker into the modern era and broaden its appeal beyond its mainly male sports car clientele.Speaking at the factory, which is already producing test vehicles, Palmer said Aston Martin was targeting the tens of thousands of multimillionaire women in countries such as the US and China who are able to spend more than £140,000 on a car.“The DBX is seen as being neither male- nor female-biased – it’s neutral,” he said, referring to the results of testing with wealthy SUV owners.The facility, still in the process of being completed, is situated on an old RAF base, which the Ministry of Defence handed over for commercial use after political interventions to secure employment in the UK. The Welsh government is paying for a new access road.The factory will eventually employ about 1,000 people – a particular boon for south Wales, which fought off competition from Birmingham, Alabama, as well as from British rivals.The site is just a 20-minute drive from Ford’s Bridgend engine plant, which the US carmaker last week said would close in September 2020, at the cost of 1,700 jobs. But they will not find it easy to switch to Aston Martin. Keith Stanton, Aston Martin’s head of manufacturing, said he expected that many Ford employees would have transferable skills but in previous rounds of recruitment there had been 100 candidates for every available job.Ford’s decision came during one of the most challenging periods faced by the British car industry, with carmakers struggling with slumping demand for diesel engines amid growing concerns about air pollution, as well as a near freeze in investment because of Brexit uncertainty.In February the Japanese carmaker Honda announced its Swindon factory would close in 2021, and Nissan abandoned a decision to invest in building its new X-Trail vehicle at its Sunderland plant, with Brexit in particular thought by industry experts to have been a contributing factor.Aston Martin has not been immune. It has struggled since floating in October at £19 a share, when the company was valued at about £4.3bn. Since then the value of Britain’s only listed carmaker has fallen by almost half, trading at just over £10 on Monday.The company has been hit by higher than expected marketing costs, as well as the considerable costs of carrying out the initial public offering and £30m set aside for Brexit preparations. It made a loss before tax of £17.3m in the first quarter of the year.However, Aston Martin is still having success in China. While lower-cost carmakers have struggled as sales to Chinese buyers last year fell for the first time in almost three decades, Palmer said he had seen little sign of any difficulty selling in China.The St Athan factory will eventually build about 7,000 vehicles, matching Aston Martin’s main facility in Gaydon, Warwickshire. Two new models under the Lagonda luxury marque, which has been revived as a battery electric vehicle brand, will account for about 2,000 of these.But before that, if Palmer’s plans succeed, the DBX SUV should become Aston Martin’s best-selling car, with 5,000 to be built in 2021."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e38229f3b5fbdf7cb040e85ac5ca811762960115/0_90_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65e81db2117b3a17d214e6d8ec48b8f1","title":"da vinci salvator mundi saudi prince yacht","story":"Report of Salvator Mundi’s whereabouts confirms trend for great artworks to be displayed aboard billionaires’ superyachtsThe world’s most expensive artwork – Leonardo da Vinci’s masterpiece Salvator Mundi – has reportedly been installed on Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman’s superyacht.The location of the painting has been a mystery since it was sold for a record $450m (£350m) at auction by Christie’s in New York in 2017. On Monday, Artnet, an art industry news service, reported that the 500-year-old painting was being kept on Prince Mohammed’s €500m (£440m) 134m yacht, Serene.Artnet said “two principals involved in the transaction” had told its reporter that “the work was whisked away in the middle of the night on MBS’s plane and relocated to his yacht, the Serene”.The Salvator Mundi (Latin for Saviour of the World), which has been at the centre of a storm of controversy over suggestions that it was painted by one of Leonardo’s assistants and not the man himself, had been due to go on display at a Middle East outpost of Paris’s Louvre gallery last September.“Having spent so long undiscovered, this masterpiece is now our gift to the world,” Mohamed Khalifa al-Mubarak, the chairman of Abu Dhabi’s department of culture and tourism, said in June 2018. “We look forward to welcoming people from near and far to witness its beauty.”However, just week’s before the scheduled unveiling on 18 September, the opening was postponed and has not been rescheduled.The Saudi embassies in London and Washington did not respond to requests for comment on the painting’s whereabouts. A spokeswoman for Christie’s did not comment on the location of the painting or its provenance.Earlier this month, one of the world’s leading experts on Leonardo criticised Christie’s for wrongly suggesting in its cataloguing of the Salvator Mundi that she was among scholars who had attributed the picture to the Renaissance master. Dr Carmen Bambach, a curator at the politan Museum of Art in New York, told the : “That is not representative of my opinion.”The identity of the buyer remained a secret following the auction until the New York Times disclosed that that it had been bought by a little-known member of the Saudi royal family, Prince Bader bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan al-Saud. He is a close friend of Prince Mohammed and after the auction was named the country’s first minister of culture.MarineTraffic, an app that tracks vessels including superyachts, shows that Serene is currently at Port Said, an Egyptian city where the the Suez Canal meets the Mediterranean Sea. has previously reported on the growing trend for billionaires installing world-renowned masterpieces on their superyachts.

Others crowd into the garish, glowing Robot Restaurant, a cavernous hall of flashing neon and dancing animatronic figures, or snap selfies in front of the giant replica head of the city’s sci-fi nemesis, Godzilla. In neighbouring Shibuya they drive convoys of go-karts through the streets wearing costumes bearing a suspicious resemblance to Mario, Luigi and the other Mario Kart characters. (Last week Nintendo successfully sued the “MariCar” company for copyright infringement for the second time.)After many decades as a famously impenetrable city to visitors, Japan’s capital is finally beginning to face outward. Tourism, particularly from China but also western countries, rose to record levels last year, and next summer the city will slide open its doors for the Olympics and Paralympics. The country has relaxed its restrictive immigration rules, a move that promises to transform Tokyo. The capital is already dotted with co-working spaces, artisanal coffee shops, international brand boutiques and the other accoutrements of a “global” city.As Japan\u0027s capital enters a year in the spotlight, from the Rugby World up to the 2020 Olympics,  Cities is spending a week reporting live from the largest megacity on Earth. Despite being the world\u0027s riskiest place – with 37 million people vulnerable to tsunami, flooding and due a potentially catastrophic earthquake – it is also one of the most resilient, both in its hi-tech design and its pragmatic social structure. Using manga, photography, film and a group of salarimen rappers, we\u0027ll hear from the locals how they feel about their famously impenetrable city finally embracing its global crownBy many sensible measures, it met that criteria long ago. It is the world’s largest megalopolis, by far, with 13 million people in the central wards and a greater metropolitan area home to 37 million (Delhi is second with 27 million). It boasts the world’s largest metro economy, with a GDP bigger than that of New York and London, and is home to more global company HQs than any other city. Its public transport network, cleanliness, low crime rate and cuisine are unrivalled.By other reckonings, however, Tokyo remains slightly out of step with its global cousins. Women remain rare in senior business and government positions, restaurants still fill with carcinogenic cigarette smoke and an alarming number of Tokyo citizens die from overwork.The city has embraced international consumer culture, “but Tokyo isn’t erse, at least not in the way London or New York are,” says Christopher Harding, senior lecturer in Asian history at Edinburgh University and author of Japan Story: In Search of a Nation. “All over Tokyo you have film, TV, music, shopping, gaming and so on that feels ‘opened up’ and cosmopolitan, while underneath, attempts to open up in terms of ersifying the population and shifting the attitudes of local Japanese – about who belongs and who doesn’t – haven’t really got anywhere.”This year, however, may be Tokyo’s great tipping point, with genuine transformation into a more open city taking on an air of inevitability, both for demographic and business reasons.The changing face of the “typical” Tokyoite will continue. Last year, Shinzo Abe’s conservative government relaxed immigration laws to open the country’s doors to up to 345,000 workers over the next five years.The decision was less a sea change in traditional resistance to immigration and more of an ad hoc response to the tightest labour shortage in decades, as the number of Japanese people of working age continues to shrink.It has also taken the lead in promoting ersity. In 2015, Shibuya ward became the first place in Japan to issue certificates recognising same-sex partnerships as “equivalent to marriage”, allowing same-sex couples to rent apartments together and granting them hospital visitation rights. Even as the national government remains resistant to legalising same-sex marriages, 20 municipalities in Japan have followed Tokyo’s lead with partnership systems.The Olympics, too, may have a profound effect, if the first time the city hosted the event is any indication.In what has been described as the greatest urban transformation in history, the 1964 Games saw a period of mass investment in infrastructure, water and sewage systems. In the five years leading up to the torch relay, 10,000 new buildings appeared in the capital, as well as five 5-star hotels, two new subway lines and a monorail from Haneda airport to the city centre. The Olympics also marked the debut of Japan’s greatest contribution to high-speed travel: the Shinkansen bullet train.Peter Matanle, a senior lecturer at the School of East Asian Studies, Sheffield University, says: “The 1964 Olympics was a huge boost in terms of opening up Tokyo to foreign visitors. One thing that it did was also to make Japan and Tokyo more accessible for other Asians in particular, as many had bad feelings towards Japan. The Olympics helped to build a new era for Japan as a peaceful country in Asia, as much as in the rest of the world.”The steep curve of development sparked by that sporting event may have levelled out, but the momentum of change extends to the sector for which Tokyo is perhaps best known: its restaurant scene.Tokyo can now lay claim to being the most global restaurant city on Earth. It has more Michelin-starred restaurants than any other city. Some of its Italian and south Asian restaurants are as authentic as their more established Japanese, Korean and Chinese counterparts.It wasn’t that long ago that requests for vegetarian dishes would be met with puzzlement, occasionally bordering on disdain, but that is changing, says the chef and food writer Yukari Sakamoto. “The Michelin guide helped put Tokyo on the international map,” she says. “Of course, Japan has always had a huge variety of excellent cuisine, but many travellers who had not considered coming to Japan are now coming because of the Michelin guide.”There are, of course, countless tales of customers making culinary gaffes with behaviour that is considered downright rude: making reservations only to not show up, pondering over a bowl of noodles when there are other people waiting to be seated. And spare a thought for the legendary sushi chef Jiro Ono, who looked on in horror as a group of tourists devoured delicate slices of raw fish but left the oblongs of vinegared rice on their plate. They were politely asked to leave.Bafflingly, Tokyo has failed to keep up with advances in urban cycling made by other cities around the world, despite the huge number of residents who ride bikes on pavements for short trips.Blue arrows to guide cyclists along Tokyo’s streets can’t conceal faults in the city’s cycling infrastructure, says Byron Kidd, who runs the Tokyo By Bike blog.“I had assumed,” he says, “after the uptick in cycling and awareness of cycling infrastructure generated by the London 2012 Olympics, that Tokyo would follow suit and develop a world-class cycling infrastructure, the supposed goal of all Olympic host cities. But cyclists are still viewed as an annoyance, as getting in the way of other road users.”By contrast, in a country where disability activism is in its infancy, wheelchair access is an achievement in which the local authorities can take some pride.“Japan has this image of being inaccessible, but in fact Tokyo is much better on access than a lot of people give it credit for – it’s certainly at the better end of cities in Asia and North America,” says Josh Grisdale, who runs the Accessible Japan website. “People from Europe come here and say it’s much easier to get around than back home.”“Eating out is a huge issue because laws on accessibility don’t apply to smaller restaurants – and there are lots of those in Tokyo,” he adds. “I’ve been turned away numerous times, then spent ages looking for somewhere else. They could have portable ramps that could be opened up without too much inconvenience.”Many of the challenges facing Japan are not confined to the capital: the lack of women in senior positions in the public and private sector, the relatively new phenomenon of child poverty, the scourge of karoshi – death through overwork – and the threat posed by natural disasters.As it prepares for the coming spotlight as a venue for the Rugby World Cup this autumn and as Olympic host next year, some of the more manageable anomalies are likely to be eradicated, with wider free wifi coverage, more international cashpoints and a concerted attempt to make a dent in the frustratingly resilient language barrier. There is also a growing desire for more green spaces, and for smoke-free restaurants – a demand the government has gone some way to addressing, although the measures have not received universal support.These embellishments will only add to Tokyo’s status as a global city, according to Mark Schreiber, an American writer who has lived here since 1966.“Tokyo is a lot more international than Seoul and Beijing,” he says. “Look at the multilingual signs and announcements at rail stations and aboard trains. Most of these services were already in place even before Tokyo was awarded the 2020 Games. You have to remember that from the Middle Ages, Tokyo was a place that absorbed outsiders, and most Tokyoites come from somewhere else. It’s fairly inclusive as far as Asian cities go.”Harding says: “I can imagine Tokyo becoming quite a bit more erse in the next few decades. Japan’s bureaucracy is backing it, and the story of Japan’s past 150 years is that its bureaucrats almost always get what they want in the end. I could see quality of life improving too. The result would be more like London than New York – the latter was built on immigration from the beginning, whereas London wasn’t, and Tokyo won’t be. I could imagine Tokyo becoming a bilingual city, even.”Ultimately, as Japan grapples with a looming demographic crisis, the opening up of Tokyo may become inevitable as a matter of survival.Nearby, inside a basement bar through a door with a sign imploring English speakers to “Don’t warry, be happy!” Shingo Shibamoto, a member of a Kabukicho business association and owner of an okonomiyaki restaurant, says outward-facing neighbourhoods such as Kabukicho – which, though home to the city’s red-light district, also attracts as many as a quarter of a million people every day to around 4,000 bars, restaurants, cafes, pachinko parlours and video arcades – are the future of an “open Tokyo”.“This has always been a place for outsiders to come and live and work,” he says. “Traditionally it attracted Chinese and Korean people, but now they’ve been joined by people from south-east Asia. I think our neighbourhood has a genuinely global appeal. And as older people who have been here for decades hand their businesses over to younger generations, the pace of change will only increase.” Cities is live in Tokyo for a special week of in-depth reporting.

Wasn’t this once the ‘competent party’?Imagine that some Rip Van Winkle, in a coma since 2010, suddenly wakes to look around and see what’s happening as the Tories choose our next prime minister. He’s an acute social observer, so he starts to check the facts of this decade and is shocked by what he finds.Wherever he looks, whatever he checks, he finds the scars of austerity are all around – and he assumes that’s what the candidates will confront.Talking to staff from his hospital bed he hears of 100,000 unfilled vacancies for overstressed NHS staff, with 2 million more people on hospital waiting lists. What kind of aftercare will he get, he asks? Not much, they say, with 1.4 million fewer frail people getting any social care, due to local councils stripped of half their funds.Children are hungry, he finds, as the threshold for free school meals has risen steeply. He checks the Institute for Fiscal Studies site and cries, Good grief! Pay has stagnated, and incomes still haven’t caught up with a decade ago, unknown since Napoleonic times. Good God, he exclaims when he finds four in 10 children are living in poverty, the highest proportion for 60 years. He doesn’t recognise the term “food bank”, but he finds there are now more than 2,000, catering for a million hungry families. Why? He checks what happened to social security, and sees the gigantic size of benefit cuts.Look, he tells the patient in the next bed. For the first time in our lives, longevity is falling not rising: a year has been cropped off his life while he slept. Worse, infant mortality has risen for the past two years – something unknown in his lifetime. The number of children in care has doubled, as cutbacks in social workers mean there’s no one to help families before they reach crisis.When Van Winkle first woke, he had been eager to find out what brave new world of social progress had sprung up in his absence. Depressed, he turns on the bedside TV. On the news channel he finds an array of press conferences for prime ministerial candidates. He watches them strut their stuff in interviews, and follows their self-promoting newspaper articles. The word Brexit at first puzzles him, but then appals him as he pieces together the mighty political catastrophe that has befallen the country. Boris Johnson as frontrunner makes him yearn to fall back into a coma. He notes the rank hypocrisy of Gove snorting coke and the next day writing a bombastic anti-drug column in the Times. But even that seems less outrageous than Johnson’s sociopathic knack for cheating, lying and misleading voters, mysteriously forever invulnerable.Gove will abolish VAT, swapping it for a lesser sales tax. “I value every inidual. I want everyone to be the author of their own life story” – which sounds as if that means no one should expect help from the state for anything. Esther McVey would also purloin the £39bn owed to the EU, to spend on a public sector pay rise. Only Matt Hancock and Rory Stewart eschew the fairyland of competing tax cuts. As for Brexit, whether it’s “Ready to Lead” with Gove or “Ready for Raab”, this is all dreamland Brextasy.Van Winkle sinks into gloom at candidates’ familiar boasts that Britain will rule the waves again. These ministers, responsible for every aspect of British life, seem utterly oblivious of the mountain to climb just to get back to 2010, yet promise everything “world class” and “world beating”. “I want to make Britain walk tall in the world again,” proclaims Hunt. “I want to make us the fastest growing most dynamic, pro-business, pro-enterprise, hi-tech economy in Europe.” The Brexit reflex is just another twitch of the old imperial fantasy, Van Winkle notes. Why can’t our politicians express a dignified patriotic love of country without world-class bragging that only makes us look absurd in our current state?Gove does it too: “With Brexit, this can be the best country in the world.” He promises to “make Britain the best place to live, learn, raise a family, achieve your potential, and start and run a business”. Is that restoring benefits, raising school spending to our competitors’ level, repairing social care and health – while cutting taxes too? In fact-free mode, Gove boasts how many schools he improved.By now Van Winkle is weary of the backstories paraded: fish-dealer father, bus-driver father, time in care, rambling in Afghanistan, running a business. Who cares? Just start with tax and spend numbers that add up. Wasn’t this once the competent party? Which of them will admit the state into which they have plunged the country? All are clueless as to what it would take to repair.Pondering so many tax cuts, Van Winkle wonders what other public services could be sliced away? He is glad to see he is not alone: Paul Johnson, IFS guru, has blown the whole lot of them to kingdom come, totting up their billions of spending and billions of tax cuts, appalled they have “no fiscal strategy”, no “seriousness” – leaving treasury heads banging on their desks. Van Winkle’s head aches and he calls for pain relief."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/878c0288f524a298222e477c715940ceabc5391d/0_106_5000_2999/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bce45bc2c48e0f7db5210a4fa852fe30","title":"the guardian view on identities in conflict dealing with differences","story":"Questions of identity and belief go to the heart of who we are. Important to us inidually, they also determine the shape of our lives – and confer advantages and disadvantages. Equalities legislation in the UK outlaws discrimination by employers and service providers on grounds of nine protected characteristics. These include sexual orientation, reassigned gender, race, sex and religion. Despite this, prejudice based on these factors has not been eradicated. On the contrary, the evidence is that bigotry’s role in aggravating offence is on the rise. Similar trends are apparent in other parts of the world, particularly where authoritarian populists are in charge.This seems obvious in the sense that the election of rightwing nationalists appears to validate their rhetoric, leading to a hate crime surge. Specific incidents are harder to lay at the feet of such politicians. In the UK, Brexit’s populist rhetoric has been linked to a sharp rise in such offences. Seen in this light, the attacks on two lesbian couples over the weekend, one on a London bus and the other on a Southampton street, are a reminder that this nation cannot be complacent about the threat it faces. Both couples were assaulted by strangers.After several decades of progress on gay and lesbian rights, starting with the partial decriminalisation of homosexuality in 1967, the UK is confronted with an ugly spurt of homophobic violence. In addition, police said a racist motive was among lines of inquiry in the case of a German teenager, thought to be of Lebanese origin, who was left with serious head injuries following an attack by a group of teenagers at the weekend in Canterbury.Those responsible for such acts must be brought to justice. But such events should also give pause for reflection to other people, who would never themselves dream of screaming abuse or physically attacking someone, but who may, deliberately or not, have contributed to a culture of growing intolerance. Politicians and campaigners such as Katie Hopkins or Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, who make a career out of stirring up ision, are easily identified. But there has also been a more general coarsening and polarisation of public discourse.This has been painfully evident over recent weeks in Birmingham, where protests by parents against LGBT lessons at one primary school spread to others, encouraged by activists said by MPs to be “religious extremists”. While the original school has engaged a mediator, the dispute at a second school continues. Labour whips are right to rebuke Roger Godsiff MP for supporting the protests, which have been banned by the high court from the school’s immediate vicinity. Peaceful demonstrations are part of democracy’s fabric. Intimidation is not. The same is true in Scotland, where plans to create “buffer zones” around abortion clinics are being considered because of the aggression of anti-abortion protesters.Lessons in tolerance are needed. But it is not only children who need to learn to treat other people with respect. Last week the lesbian feminist campaigner Julie Bindel, who is also a  contributor, was left shaken after she was verbally abused and lunged at by a transgender activist after a public meeting in Edinburgh. The argument between trans activists and feminists regarding proposed legal reforms has unfortunately become extremely bitter. Both groups feel their identities and beliefs are threatened by each other. Finding a way through the current impasse will not be easy. Any efforts to reach an accommodation deserve support. Physical threats and violence against marginalised groups, including women, trans and gay people must end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e693f85bca3afd3ed3a1431529568fa673b3dbc/0_44_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bba2bcadff8cc4c4c620fa657857637","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of sunny","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘sunny’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘sunny’.Share your photos of what sunny means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 12 June at 10am.

From fancy pants to unisex streetwear, sun-drenched LA style to seriously chic wet weather gear, here are eight stores you’ll definitely want to drop into – and dwell.Beija LondonFounded by sisters Abbie Miranda and Mazie Fisher, Beija London is on a mission to revolutionise the way we buy underwear and swimwear. Every elegant, sculptural design comes in three sizing categories, from wire-free bralettes to full support, created to fit and celebrate AA-G cup sizes without ever compromising on style. Having gathered a cult online following, the brand’s first bricks and mortar store is as coolly minimalist as its lingerie, with abundant greenery and plenty of space for fittings. In fact, Beija’s approach is such a breath of fresh air that it almost feels as good as taking your bra off at the end of a long day. Almost.18montroseWith a roll call of labels including Stone Island, Maison Margiela, Rick Owens, Yeezy and Alexander Wang, concept store 18montrose is leading the way in unisex design. Technically, Coal Drops Yard is its third UK outlet (the boutique retailer also has stores in Glasgow and Nottingham), but this is their only London presence, and with more than 450 sq m of space, this is a temple to contemporary streetwear that goes way beyond the hype. The perfect place to get your kicks, and everything else that goes with them.Form\u0026ampThreadEthical, sustainable, sewed by fairly-paid workers in Portugal and packaged in biodegradable materials, everything at Form\u0026ampThread is transparent. Except the clothes. Favouring quality fabrics and muted colours, this understated menswear label creates beautifully timeless pieces think mid-weight cotton twill shirts with off-centre buttons and oversized chest pockets, classic tapered chinos, and discreetly textured socks, all in earthy tones such as brick, pebble, olive and navy.LavenhamLavenham has come a long way. Born in the Suffolk town of the same name, this thoroughly British brand has been making quilted gilets and jackets since 1969. The swinging 60s might be long gone, but this premium outerwear has stood the test of time. Whether you’re after an ironic city twist on rural style or just something warm and stylish to walk the dog in, all emphasis here is on quality, comfort and durability. They even offer a repairs service.LPOLWife and husband team Katy Bell and John Maskell graduated from Central Saint Martins in 2006, so it’s fitting that their shop and studio is now based in Coal Drops Yard, only a stone’s throw from the world-famous art school. LPOL’s sleek totes, rucksacks and satchels are all crafted with a zero-waste philosophy every scrap of leather is reused to make prototypes, wallets or bag tags. The brand name stands for Lost Property of London – although you won’t want to lose yours.Outsiders StoreAs the name suggests, Outsiders Store wants to keep you warm and dry when you’re outside. Stocking some of the biggest and coolest names in adventure wear, from pastel Patagonia anoraks to Blundstone boots and portable coffee makers, it’s a one-stop shop for happy campers, urban hikers and all that lies between. While the first Outsiders Store opened in Liverpool, the Coal Drops Yard boutique finds the retailer a second site in the heart of the capital, and home to a beautifully curated selection that’ll have even the most fashion-devoted Londoner yearning for a style excursion beyond zone five.TwiinIf you’ve ever crushed on that photo of Farrah Fawcett on a skateboard, Twiin is a must-visit. London’s first LA-inspired concept store, influenced by similarities between the two cities’ style tribes (we’re flattered), the store stocks a mix of luxe contemporary and vintage pieces. While the furnishings are mid-century, the ethos is pure 2019: socially-conscious brands, golden lighting and Instagram opportunities all over the shop. Even a little rain can’t kill the vibe.Wolf \u0026amp BadgerSince launching in 2010, Wolf \u0026amp Badger has established itself as a leading global online marketplace for independent brands. Wolf \u0026amp Badger’s Coal Drops Yard store is an exciting physical space to shop, swoon and find inspiration – boasting more than 600 independent brands with an eye for design. One of Coal Drops Yard’s largest stores (you’ll have to go all the way to New York for another outpost), this light-filled emporium has three floors of fashion, homeware, beauty and jewellery, as well as an in-store florist, a Raw Press juice bar and a restaurant, hicce – former Murano head chef Pip Lacey’s new outing – to replenish you for another trying-on session.

Garment production has doubled in the past 15 years, with £140m worth of clothes a year ending up in landfill – and it’s a situation shoppers are very mindful of.And, in these times of digital overload, we’re rediscovering the joy of a bricks-and-mortar experience. Forward-thinking new retail districts are reimagining the traditional high street, putting an emphasis on storytelling and craftsmanship with stores for customers to spend time in. Coal Drops Yard is one such destination. As the name suggests, the warren of Victorian brick viaducts was originally built to house coal. In the 1990s, the warehouses became a new home for the clubbing scene, and now the area has reinvented itself once again as London’s most progressive shopping and restaurant district, home to a new crop of fashion and lifestyle brands encouraging shoppers to practise a more mindful kind of consumption.Tracey Neuls, a cult footwear designer who has been producing handmade shoes for the past 19 years, is just one example of a craftsperson pushing for conscious consumption. Each new design is sculpted by Neuls in clay, then produced by a Portuguese atelier using Italian leather from ethical tanneries. In her Coal Drops Yard boutique, shoes hang from the ceiling on ribbons, to be admired and encircled like mini works of art.“The rise in disposable fashion is having a wonderful knock-on effect of creating a new shopper who is more interested in quality than quantity,” explains Neuls. “Excess and choice are being replaced by emotive purchases that people intend to have around for years. We have customers who have described our shoes that they bought some 10 years ago as if they were talking about their pets – with the same attachment and love.”Neuls’ philosophy is shared by her Coal Drops Yard neighbour, leather goods brand LPOL. Founded by husband and wife team Katy Bell and John Maskell, they put responsible material sourcing and zero waste at the centre of everything they do. “As designers, we’re concerned with three things: fabric, form and function,” they explain. “The sole aim is to combine them effortlessly, sustainably and desirably in the best traditions and progression of our craft.”Meanwhile, clothes that haven’t found such long-term relationships (yet) are welcomed at Boutique by Shelter, where secondhand garments get a new lease of life. Furnished with salvaged materials and stocked with a covetable pick-and-mix of designer, high street and vintage donations, all at a fraction of the original price. But the store’s appeal goes far beyond bargains – it’s a community hub, a volunteering scheme, a source of vital funds to end homelessness and a way to tackle fashion’s waste problem.The new wave of conscious consumption doesn’t only mean caring for the planet it’s about the human impact, too, supporting businesses that strive to do good on both sides of the counter, and this is reflected in Coal Drop Yard’s retailers. Form\u0026ampThread champions fair pay for its factory workers Beija London strives to make more inclusive underwear, designed for women of all sizes with comfort and empowerment at heart and design practice and community space STORE Store addresses social imbalance within art, design and architecture by hosting creative courses for the general public, with a special focus on creating new opportunities for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.Trying harder is something we could surely all be doing. But while responsible shopping is just that – a responsibility, to do our due diligence and look a little harder at our habits – it’s not to say it shouldn’t be a pleasure, too. Neuls feels that the secret to more conscious shopping is foregoing trends and following your instinct. “If you shop with the view to invest in footwear that doesn’t go out of fashion, that makes you feel confident and makes you smile, then you are on the right track,” she says. And that’s an emotional investment as much as a financial one.In fact, most sustainability champions agree that it’s positivity – not guilt, shame or scary statistics – that drives the best trade. Make people feel bad about themselves, and they seek solace in a high street binge. But make us feel good about ourselves, and we’ll make good choices. The Coal Drops Yard approach might just be the future of shopping – do it slowly, and do it in style.To find out more about Coal Drops Yard’s carefully curated offerings, head to coaldropsyardshop-eat-drink"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f1f1a0139c4acae8fbaa0c00279c1ce7b370a727/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cebc09472be637110780c868e925a52","title":"kx marks the spot how kings cross became londons newest creative neighbourhood","story":"With the arrival of shopping and dining district Coal Drops Yard, King’s Cross has cemented its place as one of London’s most exciting destinations – for work and playMove over Shoreditch, make way Marylebone high street, fashion and design has found a new home in the capital: King’s Cross. Formerly known as the badlands of the city, the area has now transformed into a lively neighbourhood.Following the , who moved into the music and art hub Kings Place in 2008, the legendary fashion and design school Central Saint Martins, which counts Alexander McQueen and Stella McCartney among its alumni, took up residence in neighbouring Granary Square in 2011. More recently, big cultural players including Google, the House of Illustration, Universal Music, the Knowledge Quarter and Time Out have also arrived – bringing with them more people, ideas and creativity.But King’s Cross is far from “all work”. Making use of the Victorian brick viaducts that once held London’s coal store, the bright and airy 20,000 sq ft Coal Drops Yard has taken on a new life as a shopping and dining nirvana. The impossibly stylish redesign – undertaken by the award-winning King’s Cross-based architect, Thomas Heatherwick – is topped off with an already iconic “kissing roof”, which will soon be home to Samsung’s new flagship store.And hang out they do. King’s Cross, which is home to one of the capital’s main railway arteries and the Eurostar terminal at St Pancras, has always been busy with people passing through but, now, it’s a destination in its own right.Already home to an enviable collection of foodie hotspots and cultural highlights – from the KERB food market that sets up for lunch service in Granary Square three days a week, to the nearby British Library and Wellcome Collection, both just a short walk away – when Coal Drops Yard arrived in October 2018, it was seen by many as the icing on the cake. Home to more than 50 stores and restaurants, many of which are young, independent businesses, every archway is filled with thought-provoking products and tantalising flavours.When it comes to fashion, Coal Drops Yard is definitely adding to the conversation, with a unique and eclectic range of brands and boutiques from a three-storey Cos store (which doubles a space to celebrate the art and design that inspires their clothes) and stylish Fred Perry outlet, to independent boutiques such as S120 and Form\u0026ampThread, and menswear heavy-hitters, Universal Works, to name but a few.“We’ve always envisioned King’s Cross as a microcosm of the city – it’s a erse community where people live, work, study and socialise,” explains Anna Strongman, partner at Argent. “In Coal Drops Yard, we’ve aimed to create a unique destination that connects all types of visitors through our combination of shops, restaurants and a vibrant year-round cultural events programme.”With so much change taking place in such a short space of time, it’s fair to say the area’s blossoming into a creative neighbourhood has taken some people by surprise. “When I first moved to London almost seven years ago, I wouldn’t have imagined King’s Cross would be considered a ‘fashion hub,’” says Central Saint Martins alumni and 10 Magazine’s fashion and features assistant, Helena Fletcher.Not everyone is as shocked by the area’s metamorphosis, though. “Generally, when creative industries move into a space in any city, that space then becomes desirable over time,” explains Adam Murray, fashion lecturer at Central Saint Martins.For Henry Graham, creative director and co-founder of Wolf \u0026amp Badger, which has a three-storey concept store in the main yard, Coal Drops Yard is a destination that really stands out from the competition. “In what is an increasingly homogeneous retail landscape, the King’s Cross Central Limited Partnership should be applauded for their courage in proactively seeking out innovative and unique fashion and lifestyle retailers, all of whom, through their stores in Coal Drops Yard, bring a new experience not only to the immediate area but London as a whole,” he says.To discover more about Coal Drop Yard’s unique stores, restaurants and packed diary of cultural events, head to coaldropsyard"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d69e444ee2358370a4b35574f44acc04bae2542/354_311_4830_2898/master/4830.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=705d037244c3b8774ec89a2288a0f488","title":"drop it like its hot style inspiration from londons new home of cool","story":" At Coal Drops Yard, creativity is all around you, from the architectural juxtaposition of old and new to the contents of the stores and the people who work in them.

There are far too many children who have ended up in youth custody who had speech and language problems at school.”Urban areas tend to spend more than rural areas. Local authority spend per child is highest in London, at just over £7 per pupil, with the south-east just behind at a little under £6. It is lowest in the east Midlands, which spends 34p, and the West Midlands (90p).Generally, CCGs fund the bulk of spending on SLT. The north of England has the highest CCG spend per child at just under £18, followed by London, at just over £17. The lowest CCG spend per child is in the Midlands and East NHS region (just over £10) followed by the south of England (just under £14).A government spokesperson said: “As part of the NHS’s long-term plan, we are working to improve support for children and young people, including considering how to ensure we have the right numbers of speech and language therapists to meet demand.“We are boosting local early-years services with £8.5m to help establish best practice and are providing £50m to develop more high-quality school-based nursery provision for disadvantaged children, £26m to set up a network of English hubs and a national training centre, and £20m on the professional development of early-years practitioners – ensuring every child can thrive.”James Bowen, director of policy at the National Association of Head Teachers, said: “Children’s early speech and language skills are the foundations upon which all future learning is built. If children fall behind in the early years, it can prove difficult, often impossible, for them to catch up later, even with additional help.“Early intervention is key, but schools are finding it harder and harder to access specialist help from speech and language therapists, as both school budgets and local authority budgets are cut.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0002d4946014d397ae570502268da3b83172494c/158_0_2342_1405/master/2342.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9709a9ad90c571ef70808cbca760fb47","title":"greenpeace activists board bp oil rig as it is towed out to sea","story":"Energy firm expected to launch court proceedings to remove activists who boarded vessel on SundayScottish police have begun talks with climate protesters from Greenpeace after its activists boarded an oil rig heading out to the North Sea.Two protesters climbed on to the 27,000-tonne platform as it was being towed out of the Cromarty Firth, north of Inverness, after Greenpeace used boats to intercept it at about 6.30pm on Sunday.The two activists unfurled a banner bearing the words “climate emergency” – a reference to the urgent need to reduce and halt fossil fuel use – after occupying a gantry on one leg of the rig underneath its main deck.Greenpeace said the protesters had enough food for several days and were planning to remain on board until BP abandoned its new oilfields and switched to investing in renewables.On Monday, Police Scotland liaison officers met Greenpeace support staff to try to negotiate a peaceful end to the occupation. As yet, no police officers are thought to have boarded the rig, but Greenpeace expects BP to quickly launch court proceedings in an effort to force the activists off the vessel.BP refused to comment on its plans. The rig, Paul B Loyd Jr, is owned by Transocean and leased to BP for £140,000 a day. It was a Transocean rig operated by BP that caused the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. In a statement released by Greenpeace, an activist on the rig called Jo said: “Warm words flow from BP on their commitment to tackling climate change. Yet this rig, and the 30m barrels it seeks to drill, are a sure a sign that BP are committed to business as usual, fuelling a climate emergency that threatens millions of lives and the future of the living world.”A Police Scotland spokesman said: “In relation to the ongoing protest involving Greenpeace in the Cromarty Firth, Police Scotland is working with the operators, the port authority and other interested parties in an effort to resolve the situation as safely as possible.”Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, has adopted a tough target set by the UK Committee on Climate Change (CCC) to cut Scotland’s carbon emissions to net zero by 2045, but has not accepted demands to close down North Sea oilfields as a matter of urgency.The UK government has not yet accepted the CCC’s net zero target of 2050 for the UK as a whole. The net zero concept allows some burning of fossil fuels, as long as the CO2 is captured and stored underground, or offset by tree planting or similar measures.The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen:• Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest.• Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load.• Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.\u0026nbsp • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050.• Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels. Describing the protesters’ actions as irresponsible for putting themselves and others at risk, BP said: “We share the protesters’ concerns about the climate. We support the Paris agreement. And we are working every day to advance the world’s transition to a low-carbon future.“We’re reducing emissions from our own operations – down 1.7m tonnes last year – improving our products to help our customers reduce their emissions, and creating new low carbon businesses. We are committed to being part of the solution to the climate challenge facing all of us.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c48bb7793277014b0f47b866e03cf3b3d931c0cd/0_153_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5930d75b551138930d50026442d39af5","title":"frightening number of plant extinctions found in global survey","story":"Study shows 571 species wiped out, and scientists say figure is likely to be big underestimateHuman destruction of the living world is causing a “frightening” number of plant extinctions, according to scientists who have completed the first global analysis of the issue.They found 571 species had definitely been wiped out since 1750 but with knowledge of many plant species still very limited the true number is likely to be much higher. The researchers said the plant extinction rate was 500 times greater now than before the industrial revolution, and this was also likely to be an underestimate.“Plants underpin all life on Earth,” said Dr Eimear Nic Lughadha, at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, who was part of the team. “They provide the oxygen we breathe and the food we eat, as well as making up the backbone of the world’s ecosystems – so plant extinction is bad news for all species.”The number of plants that have disappeared from the wild is more than twice the number of extinct birds, mammals and amphibians combined. The new figure is also four times the number of extinct plants recorded in the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s red list.“It is way more than we knew and way more than should have gone extinct,” said Dr Maria Vorontsova, also at Kew. “It is frightening not just because of the 571 number but because I think that is a gross underestimate.”She said the true extinction rate for plants could easily be orders of magnitude higher than that reported in the study, published in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution. There are thousands of “living dead” plant species, where the last survivors have no chance of reproducing because, for example, only one sex remains or the big animals needed to spread their seeds are extinct.It takes many years to be sure a plant has been wiped out, meaning there are many species awaiting formal confirmation. “How are you going to check the entirety of the Amazon for your lost plant?” Vorontsova said. And some plant species may have gone extinct before ever being discovered. Botanists find about 2,000 new species a year.A sixth mass extinction of life on Earth is under way, according to some scientists. A landmark report in May said human society was in jeopardy from the accelerating decline of the Earth’s natural life-support systems, with 1 million species of plants and animals at risk of extinction.The plant analysis found Hawaii had the most recorded extinctions (79), followed by the Cape provinces of South Africa (37), with Australia, Brazil, India and Madagascar also among the top regions. However, there may well have been as many extinctions in places that have been less well studied.The main cause of the extinctions is the destruction of natural habitats by human activities, such as cutting down forests and converting land into fields for farming. Vorontsova saw this firsthand in Madagascar when searching for an unusual-looking grass, Sartidia perrieri, that was collected just once, in 1914.“We scoured the hills and mountains … but it was not there,” she said. “In the places where it would be growing, there are cattle grazing, regular fires and people growing rice.” Vorontsova’s search for spiny wild aubergines in Tanzania and Kenya ended the same way. “We found a coastal forest completely destroyed. I was shocked.”Among the other plants lost are the Chile sandalwood, exploited into oblivion for its aromatic wood, and the Saint Helena olive, the last two specimens of which succumbed to a termite attack and fungal infections in 2003.The database of plant extinctions is the result of years of scouring scientific journals and fieldwork reports. The scientists expect it will help conservation in the future by highlighting what types of plants are particularly vulnerable to extinction. For example, location is a more important factor than type of plant: those on small islands or in areas with a Mediterranean climate are more at risk, whether they are roses, orchids or palms.“Millions of other species depend on plants for their survival, humans included, so knowing which plants we are losing and from where will feed back into conservation programmes,” said Nic Lughadha.Other scientists said the analysis was important and robust. Bjorn Robroek, an ecologist at Southampton University, said: “The finding that extinction rates are highest in bioersity hotspots that are at risk due to land-use change is alarming.”Alan Gray, of the UK’s Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said: “Scientists have not studied the vast majority of the world’s plants in any detail, so the authors are right to think the numbers they have produced are large underestimates. To address this extinction crisis, humanity will need to devise solutions that target funding towards conservation research and action. It’s time to ask not what bioersity can do for us but what we can do for bioersity.”Vorontsova said: “We suffer from plant blindness. Animals are cute, important and erse but I am absolutely shocked how a similar level of awareness and interest is missing for plants. We take them for granted and I don’t think we should.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6eecb041cc165db3efa561a60e61fa8933de408d/0_1200_8000_4800/master/8000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6af13e9ebc5e3355c81546a6ebf02797","title":"courgette mint ricotta frittata recipe rachel roddy kitchen in rome","story":"Studded with courgettes and fat crumbs of ricotta, this light, soft frittata is a herald of summerWhen did having hard-boiled eggs at Gatwick airport become a habit? Four years ago? Two years ago? I could probably work it out if I went back over the wads of boarding passes and the receipts of my pendulous life, but let’s say it was three years ago.Every time I pass through the swishing electric doors into the arrivals hall at Gatwick, while others step into the arms of loved ones, I step into the refrigerated hum of Marks and Spencer’s food hall and buy two hard-boiled eggs. I might also get some water or a sandwich, a stick of cheddar or three packs of Walnut Whips, but these are variables. The tub containing two pearly-white eggs on a squeaky bed of baby spinach is not.I don’t wait. Rather, I peel off the thin cellophane and eat as I walk to charge up my Oyster card. Too cold, too hard-boiled, and eaten too fast while walking, the eggs almost always give me heartburn. I don’t care. I love my eggs, and in that moment they are the most important and satisfying thing my welcome committee and edible Talisman before catching the Thameslink to Farringdon.Eggs meet me on the other side of the trip, too. It is often late or at an inbetween hour when I get home to Rome, but regardless of the time or what’s been eaten that day, walking through the door, dumping bags and hugging my kid makes me hungry. It is often hunger for the eggs that sit in a bowl on the kitchen worktop: perfect, patient, complete, uncomplicated and ready to be cracked into an omelette boiled or fried for toast mixed with cubes of bread for egg in a cup or scrambled into a soft pile and sooted with black pepper.If someone else needs to eat too, the egg answer is usually frittata the Italian version of an omelette without the mystique, as food writer Gillian Riley notes. Beaten egg mixed with pre-cooked vegetables, cheese, ham, breadcrumbs or leftover pasta – when it comes to a frittata, the possibilities and variations are endless.The other day, my ears still hollow with plane popping, we fried some courgettes with some olive oil and salt, until they were soft and slightly golden. We left them to cool a bit before mixing with beaten eggs, ricotta, salt, pepper and a handful of ripped mint.As is the case with almost every egg recipe, how you like, and therefore cook, your frittata is a personal thing. As with omelettes and scrambled eggs, I like my frittata ever-so-slightly custardy – not raw (shudder) – but more soft than stiff.Immediate eating is required for a softly set frittata, one that, like me, wobbles slightly in the middle. This frittata of eggs, courgettes and fat flecks of ricotta is complete, but good complemented by a green or harlequin salad of tomato, cucumber, mild red chilli and mint, then dressed with olive oil and red wine vinegar.A friend recently told me about her husband’s particular eating habits and the things he will and won’t touch (there are many). To him, eggs, whether they’re boiled, fried, scrambled, poached or coddled, are soothing, complete and reassuring. And I identify with that.400g courgettesOlive oilSalt and black pepper6 large eggs250g ricotta1 small handful of mint, rippedTop, tail then slice the courgettes into 3mm-thick rounds and pat dry. In a large, nonstick or cast iron frying pan over a medium-low heat, fry the courgettes in olive oil with a pinch of salt until soft and lightly golden, turning often. Tip on to a plate to cool slightly.In a bowl, whisk the eggs, ricotta, salt and pepper. Add the courgettes and ripped mint, then stir again.Wipe the pan clean, pour in a little more oil and put over a low flame.

There’s plenty of young talent in the squad, but a lot of France’s creativity will go through one of the veterans of the team. NaomiMy Super Falcons… could not have wished for a worse draw. France, Norway and South Korea should be too strong for us.I have a feeling… Nigeria will cause an upset or two. If that happens we should be able to progress with France to the knockout rounds.Opposition defenders will… be run ragged with the skill and pace of Asisat Oshoala and Francesca Ordega. They can provide the necessary inspiration. Ifeanyi Andrew IbehThe mood in Norway is… quite relaxed. We should progress from the group and lay to rest the ghosts of the horrible Euro 2017 campaign. A win over Nigeria will lift optimism.Our best player is… not playing. Ada Hegerberg’s decision not to play for the national team continues to create debate. A negative interview just before the tournament hasn’t been received particularly well. It’s not what is needed just now.The team will do well if… they stick together as a group. And if winger Caroline Graham Hansen finds some inspiration. IdaMy hope is… getting through the group. Quarter-finals has to be a realistic aim.My husband… is supporting his home team Germany. And, with England as a third choice, I’m bound to be cheering on a finalist, right?I’m looking forward to watching… Ji So-yun. If she finds form she can inspire this team towards the early knockout stages and beyond. Heejung ChungGermany can… end up anywhere from a group exit to winning it.I got hooked on women’s football during… the 1995 World Cup in Sweden. Manuela Goller was in goal and current coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg was also in the team. But let’s not talk about Germany’s final defeat to Norway.I love to watch… goalkeeper Almuth Schult and Dzsenifer Marozsan. She knows French football very well. From the other teams I’ll be curious to see if Marta is still as good as she was in past tournaments. Helice AnvarsinWomen’s football in Spain is… growing fast. People are finally taking an interest.The national team… won’t be anywhere near the favourites, but they can definitely be a surprise package.A good result would be… getting to through to the knockout stages.Our most skilful players is… Our captain and midfielder Amanda Sampedro. Under her leadership we have talent and motivation to do something big. Javier Perez Before the tournament I am… Nervous. We have a great team but go into the World Cup on a massive losing streak. We don’t seem able to string good games together.Australia have… the best squad we have ever fielded in a tournament. We may have lacked consistently lately but on our day we are very strong on paper. Maybe saving the best for when it matters?Our smartest player is… Sam Kerr. She’s smart off the ball and creative on it. Her goal scoring ability will be a key factor too. I’m very excited for her. KatieOur team is… Not in the nicest place right now after nine defeats in a row. The coach has been criticised for putting players out of position and it’s just not working.My hopes rest on… my country’s love of football. The sport is in our DNA. I believe and hope our love for the game will make a difference on the pitch.It will be sad to say goodbye to… Brazilian legends Marta, Formiga and Andressa Alves. They are true icons for a lot of young girls in Brazil. They broke many gender barriers, but have never been able to win the World Cup. This year I hope it gets to be a really special one for them, and for us. Isabella QueirozFor Italy to be at the World Cup is… already a result. Italian football has not been very kind to the women’s game. Just look at the comments made by the Italian football association not so long ago.We can thank… our biggest league clubs for keeping the women’s game moving. The standard of the women’s game has increased dramatically.We stand no chance against… Brazil, but I’m more confident of frustrating Australia and beating Jamaica.Our most inspirational player is… our captain Sara Gama. The symbol of what women’s football can be in Italy if we get our act together. Riccardo TeslaI expect… a decent showing in the group games at our first ever Women’s World Cup, but I would also be surprised to see us go any further.A lot of our hopes rest on… our strong and fast striker Khadija “Bunny” Shaw. And I hope goalkeeper Sydney Schneider has packed her gloves. She will be extremely busy. Dennis JonesThe country hopes that... the team will not be in France just to make up the numbers. There is little expectation and that might work in our favour.The main target will be... not ending up pointless. And learning from the experience. Women’s football in Argentina is miles behind other competitors and I fear this might show in the games. We need to show spirit.Getting through the group would be... an absolute miracle. Just look at what we’re up against. England and Japan will surely be too strong, and Scotland will be tough too. I just can’t see it. We should be content with a gracious exit and three committed performances. EzequielI really hope Japan will… go all the way to the World Cup final. It would be their third in a row. But the semi-finals is the minimum requirement.The mood in Japan is… optimistic. There’s a lot of love for the national team here and anticipation is clearly building.The country lacks… strong female role models in sport. As a teacher in Kawasaki I see sport in school clearly being the domain of boys. I hope that a positive tournament can raise the profile of women’s football further and will have a knock-on effect in promoting women’s sport.This could be the tournament for… Yui Hasegawa to shine. The midfielder is on the verge of a breakthrough and this could be her summer. Gareth BellEngland should… top their group easily. The only real competition will come from Japan.The real test will come… in a quarter-final. That would potentially be against host nation France. After that things would get more and more difficult with an unbeatable looking USA in a potential semi. You never know what might happen though. This is football after all!I’m looking forward to seeing… Nikita Parris. She has been superb in the run-up to this World Cup. Hopefully Fran Kirby can recreate the magic from Euro 2017. And I’m excited to see what playing for American teams has done for Toni Duggan and Jodie Taylor. Maybe they have some insider knowledge! Esme CowardWe would do well to… avoid any thrashings in the group stage. Argentina should be beaten, but England and Japan look far too strong.I’m proud of… how we have continually improved for the past seven years. Just being at a World Cup is progress, and reward for lots of hard work.We have a world class player in… Kim Little. Missing the Euros two years ago cost us, and it will be great to see her play a key role in a major tournament. Erin Cuthbert also has a good eye for goal. Jen WattCameroon will… once again try and be competitive but fail to get out of the group.The second round can be reached if… Michaela Abam, Gabrielle Onguene and Alexandra Takounda have the tournament of their lives. Elume RaymondOur success is built on… our defence. We’ve only conceded one goal in eight matches so far in 2019. The centre-back partnership of Kadeisha Buchanan and Shelina Zadorsky has been rock solid.Our downfall is definitely… a lack of goals. We’ve only scored eight goals in those eight games and three of them came in a friendly victory over Mexico. There’s certainly quality going forward, with the likes of captain Christine Sinclair and Manchester City’s Janine Beckie, but they have struggled to create and finish chances.The odds of getting out of the group stage are… favourable. Cameroon and New Zealand are must win games, and if we can deal with the Dutch duo of Miedema and Mertens defensively, then we’ll have a chance of topping the group. But only if we find our scoring boots.Our defensive qualities will get us… to the quarter-finals. A repeat performance of 2015 is on the cards. Being solid at the back can only take you so far. Jithvan AriyaratneWith a bit of luck… the semi-finals or even the final can be in reach. Last week’s 3-0 win over Australia has proven that Oranjeleeuwinnen can match any opponentI started playing football… when I was four years old. I was the only girl at a club with over 600 boys.In the summer of 2017… the streets were coloured orange. The women’s success at Euro 2017 was the definite breakthrough of the women’s game in the Netherlands. Suddenly the media couldn’t get enough of them. Maybe we have another extraordinary summer before us?Keep an eye out for… Netherlands’ attacking style. Danielle van de Donk can both create chances and finish them and Jackie Groenen captured the nation’s heart two years ago. She’s outstanding on the ball. SophiaFootball has… made some serious inroads in New Zealand in the last couple of years. It’s not all about rugby anymore.The Football Ferns will see this World Cup as… a hugely challenging tournament. Having to face Canada and the Netherlands in the group stage is cruel.What I like about this team is… its balance. There’s plenty of quality in the ranks. I’m picking them to get out of the group. But to do that we need to make sure Cameroon is not the only team we beat. Aaron AlexanderWe have… an outside chance of making the second round. Getting something against USA will be tough, but if the stars align for us we might get a draw against Sweden. Beating Thailand is possible, but they have a minor advantage of having won a World Cup game before. Four points should be our goal.The team looks… hungry. All the media attention is focused on the shenanigans of the men’s team prior to Copa America, so I think that has helped ease any pressure on the women’s team.The star of the team is… our goalkeeper Christiane Endler who plays for PSG. She will have some busy moments, but I hope we don’t see her too often. Alvaro ValenzuelaWe should… reach the second round without any problems. But the games in the knockout stages should be more evenly matched.A realistic ambition is… the quarter-finals. Then we’d have to squeeze past Germany or the USA. It will be interesting to see how we fare against them in the group game. That should give us an idea of where we are at.My local club IK Sirius… has been represented by both Sweden’s Nathalie Björn and Canada’s Allysha Chapman. It will be fun to watch them in France on the big stage. A shoutout to Brazil’s Marta too, who I hope bows out in style. David EkstrandOur squad depth… is unmatched by any other team. That’s why I believe the trophy will be ours again. I had the opportunity to be at the World Cup final in 2015 and it was the most amazing sporting event I’ve ever been too.All of the 23 team members… would start for any of the other nations in the tournament.Our defence is not… Fort Knox but they will still be a match for most attackers in the World Cup. Plus our offence will be incredible from start to finish.The shirt I bought for the tournament… has Julie Ertz’s name on the back. She’s a force to be reckoned with in midfield.

It moved, danced, jumped, sang, clapped and swayed in unison for the Indomitable Lionesses. This was a migrant community welcoming their team, which includes nine players who play their club football in France, sort of home.It is rare Cameroon venture beyond their borders, unlike the two other teams from Africa competing at this World Cup, their preparations against international teams has been limited to a 1-0 loss to China in April and a 4-0 defeat by Spain in May.Meanwhile South Africa and Nigeria both competed at in the friendly Cyprus Cup. There is a reason this team came third behind those two at the African Cup of Nations, they lack cohesion on the pitch.The Canadians dominated possession but struggled to carve out clear-cut chances. Two corners and a free-kick inside four minutes gave the early impression that this would be a whitewash but as the clock ticked on, the women in green grew in confidence and Canada’s talisman, Christine Sinclair, only four shy of Abby Wambach’s record haul of 184 international goals, looked more and more isolated.With the scary pace of Gabrielle Aboudi Onguene on the right wing linking well with Ajara Nchout, who plays for the Norwegian side Valerenga, and the forward Marlyse Ngo Ndoumbouk, there were signs that a Canadian defence that has conceded only once in 2019 could be breached by the team ranked 46th in the world.Except that Canada also have someone playing at home. The 23-year-old Buchanan is the defender beginning to muscle apart Wendie Renard and Mbock Bathy’s Lyon centre-back partnership. With Aboudi Onguene bearing down on Stephanie Labbe in goal, Buchanan raced back to whip the ball from the feet of the dynamic winger where many would have conceded a penalty.With Canada slightly rattled it was Buchanan again who settled the nerves, a downward header past Annette Ngo Ndom giving the ‘visitors’ the lead moments before half-time.England’s Lucy Bronze said in April that “at the World Cup the girls at Lyon are probably the ones that are going to change the games”. With a France team built around a core of Lyon’s superstars inflicting a 4-0 defeat on South Korea, Buchanan handing Canada three points in a testing environment and Bronze and Nikita Parris providing England’s best outlet in their win over Scotland, it is hard to disagree.“The environment that we’re training in is very high,” said Buchanan. “Lyon is one of the best club teams so to have that many top players playing for them, every practice is difficult. It is all about the environment we are in before the World Cup.”What is also clear is that Canada’s progress may have edged closer but it is by no means assured. This is a tough group. Netherlands, the Euro 2017 winners, boast the best forward line in the competition while New Zealand pulled off a surprise win against England in Brighton.When defences isolate Sinclair they struggle to create. There were some hairy moments for the five sitting deep for Cameroon, with the former NWSL player Estelle Johnson and team captain Christine Manie at its heart, but they looked a far more organised side than they did at their maiden World Cup in 2015 where they lost to China in the last 16.They drove until the end but the Canadian defence held typically firm. “We take out defence very seriously,” said Buchanan. “The back line has been working together for a number of years now. All of us have quite a lot of caps playing with each other, so there’s a lot of connections there.”A reliance on that defence both to hold the dam and score the goals will take them only so far on this stage, though. With the Netherlands Canada’s final group opponents on 20 June, that back line will be really tested against the best and it may become clear whether their run to a quarter-final on home soil in 2015 was just a team surfing on home momentum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2d94e357c75098c722a38ee9d88dbb82b3729720/0_126_2300_1380/master/2300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f41c2540a60449547e9520e8080e42a","title":"all eyes on womens world cup nations league and more football weekly","story":"Max Rushden, Jonathan Wilson, Lars Sivertsen, Mark Langdon and Suzy Wrack discuss the opening weekend of France 2019, the conclusion of the Nations League, disrespect via kitchen utensils and an Ultrasling 3Join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

Jordan Pickford launched a hard, flat pass from his own six-yard box. Kane saw it coming, crept back along the line of the centre circle, then executed a kind of cushioned capoeira‑roundhouse layoff into the path of Jesse Lingard.Lingard waited a beat, scanning his options. Kane made the choice for him, surging on ahead, pointing where he wanted the ball, then dinking a brilliantly conceived back-spun chip over Switzerland’s Yann Sommer and on to the crossbar.It turned out to be something of a chimera. By the end of his 74 minutes on the pitch that sequence remained Kane’s only shot and two of his 29 touches of the ball. He played quite well in a deathly game. Even in his rust-caked post-injury mode Kane is an underrated passer, crosser and link man.But then his levels have remained very high. Even in a horribly interrupted 12 months since the World Cup Kane has three goals in seven England games, 22 in 39 overall, and should, aged 25, be coming into his career-defining pomp.Except there is of course an anxiety here, a feeling of something vital being drained. Kane is an unusually high-mileage, high-end centre-forward, a footballer who has been burning through his peak years with a zeal that borders on recklessness This is both a physical and a tactical issue. There have been five serious ankle injuries since the first in September 2016. The Transfermarkt website lists Kane as missing 184 days of football over those 33 months. Perhaps the greater regret is that it wasn’t more. Each time Kane limps away only to return ahead of time and looking sluggish when he does. So it goes on. Play, stop, rush, repeat.“Time to rest up and come back refreshed for next season,” Kane tweeted after England’s penalty shootout win, a standard player cliche that has a deeper resonance. For Kane this is a summer off that should have begun in May, a process of long-term recovery that would have benefitted from missing the Nations League and the Champions League final, neither of which gained much from his presence.These are vital months for the best English centre-forward of his era, not to mention a kind of jumping-off point. There are two points here. First is the fear of Rooney-drift. How many years, was it, that Wayne Rooney continued to wrestle his way around the England attack even in tangible physical decline? Partly owing to awe stasis, the class system in English football that makes celebrity and the idea of “respect” so hard to overcome and partly because of a dearth of talent elsewhere.England and unfit centre-forwards: it is a familiar tale from Keegan to Shearer to Owen. Kane seems to have fast-forwarded himself into this role ahead of time. Blink a few times and it’s not too hard to imagine him playing ponderously in midfield, taking the penalties and corners. Spare us, Gareth. Spare us the horror.Against this it has been part of England’s process of renewal to be agreeably ruthless. Right now Kane is the only real automatic pick left, the only player who gets in the team half-fit sole survivor of the tradition of the leader, legend, talisman, trench-dweller, chest‑beater that has blighted many a promising England era.It is to be hoped this policy is up for review. If only because there is plenty of evidence that Kane should not be a first choice if he’s not fit, a player for whom peak conditioning is utterly vital.The energy and running power Kane put on in the early Pochettino years have been the chief element in his transformation from a promising Championship loanee . At his best Kane has three main elements: great movement, crafty link play and the ability to score all kinds of goals. The last two of these all come directly from the first. Take away the movement and every other element is diminished. Kane stops being Superman and becomes the post-Kryptonite Clark Kent, energies drained, touchingly mortal.There is of course a team element to this as well. Speed is vital to the way the better teams attack, just as an England front three with Raheem Serling and Jadon Sancho on the flanks is so much more menacing without a clogging presence in the centre. England looked good with Marcus Rashford at centre-forward in the first half against the Netherlands in Guimarães. With Kane running narrower patterns in the second half the game came closing in, the Dutch defenders unafraid to play a high line and swarm around the ball.Similarly Tottenham would, with hindsight, have been better served using the speed and movement of Lucas Moura or Son Heung-min in the centre against Liverpool in the Champions League final. The return of a half-fit, single-furrow Kane had already coincided with their stumble in the spring, a period that saw Kane himself win only five of his last 14 games and fail to score in a league win since January.Kane will surely come again with time to heal and re-set. Almost exactly a year ago he was scoring his 19th goal for England in his 27th game en route to the World Cup Golden Boot, having scored 90 times in his last 97 games for club and country.But changes are needed. Tottenham must sign an adequate like-for-like replacement, or risk making Kane’s peak years the chief casualty of stadium-austerity. England, meanwhile, should resolve to play him only when fully fit.Ankles are particularly tender joints. Every strain takes a little more away, drains a little extra twang and snap and flex. There is a duty of care to fight this process, to dish up a few more of those peak years and to acknowledge the truth that a half-fit Kane is no more than half a Kane at best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dbf830ba8749d8149a087b419ae33ff5192445e/0_148_4421_2652/master/4421.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=02e00d8d440d4203de9f27e08b516251","title":"nikita parris outstanding england assured start","story":"Local rivalry made Scotland probably their toughest test in the World Cup group stage and a 2-1 win represents a job well doneAs World Cup openers go, I thought it was a very assured and mature performance from England considering the anticipation there had been building up to the game against Scotland. Because of the rivalry between the two countries and the familiarity that exists among the players, it was always going to be a tricky hurdle to overcome for Phil Neville’s side and I was impressed by the way they approached the task. England look like they are mentally prepared to play seven games in the tournament by their measured, tactical approach, managing the speed of play for the majority of the game.I agree that England can do even better if they are going to go all the way but this was arguably the toughest opening game of the tournament, so to end it with three points should not be underestimated. For me, this was also the hardest game of the group. Yes, Japan have reached the final at the last two World Cups but this is a completely different Japan team with very young players and a coach that has one eye on next year’s home Olympics.Before the match I was slightly worried that England might look a bit shaky at the back because of the number of changes there had been in the warm-up matches but they looked pretty comfortable apart from Steph Houghton’s mistake for Claire Emslie’s consolation goal. I hope Millie Bright’s injury is not too serious because obviously that would mean another change in the centre of defence but otherwise they were really solid as a unit with the two defensive midfielders in Keira Walsh and Jill Scott in front of them.I think 4-2-3-1 is the formation that best suits England because it makes it easier for the two central midfielders to pick up the opposition’s No 10 and gives Scott the platform to launch counterattacks, a feature that is key in the absence of Jordan Nobbs.We also saw the depth of the squad at Neville’s disposal. Four years ago, someone like Alex Greenwood may not have been experienced enough to step in for Demi Stokes in the opening game of the World Cup, but Greenwood showed she was capable of playing at the same level as Stokes. Then there’s the strikers – Toni Duggan has been a big player for England for a long time and started on the bench but Ellen White and Beth Mead are just as dangerous. Having them and Jodie Taylor also to come off the bench bodes well for the rest of the tournament because they are all capable of scoring goals at crucial times.But it was Nikita Parris who was the real star of the show. She is in a really rich vein of form having scored in the warm-up game against Denmark and you can tell by her celebration of the goal against Scotland that she is far from afraid about playing on this stage. Nikita has become much more clinical over the last couple of seasons and is the sort of big personality in the team who has that X-factor. She really gets on the nerves of defenders – you could see how annoyed the Scotland players were when she went down after a tackle or nutmegged them. You need that spiky player in your team to irritate opposition and she could be England’s standout in this World Cup. Hopefully if they can get to six points by winning their next match then Neville can give Nikita a rest as England will be confident of beating Argentina.By contrast, Scotland seemed to struggle to find their attacking rhythm at times and I’m not sure if it was the best tactical decision to have Erin Cuthbert playing out of position as a striker. Moving Cuthbert up front in place of Jane Ross and moving Kim Little further forward didn’t really give Scotland any cutting edge going forward that manager Shelley Kerr probably intended. It will be interesting to see if Ross comes back in for the next match against Japan because Scotland will need to try and have much more attacking force going forward to beat Japan. I believe Scotland are the best team out of the four World Cup debutants – Jamaica, Chile and South Africa are the others – and will advance at the very least as one of the best third-place spots.The penalty after 15 minutes really seemed to affect Scotland and that allowed England to take control of the game by drawing possession into the midfield and exploiting the space on the wings. Handball decisions via VAR were a big feature of the mens World Cup last year, so it is no surprise they have already become a feature in the women’s World Cup. It is becoming clear that if the ball hits a players hand in the box and the hand is in an unnatural position, a penalty will be given. However there is a slight grey area in terms of unnatural position because what may seem natural to most defenders is deemed unnatural by referees. The intent of the player to play the ball with her hand is irrelevant if the ball happens to hit the handarm outside the ’natural’ position of the body.I had a really interesting discussion about VAR with Ariane Hingst, who used to play in defence for Germany, and she recognised that this is something defenders are just going to have to adapt to. When a cross is coming in, defenders should instantly put their hands behind your back. Simple. As much as that is unnatural too and people will say it’s ridiculous, it is an adaptation that defenders will have to do to avoid penalties.Rules changes in the game often require adaptation of technique and tactics. It is no different to when the rules were introduced to prevent keepers picking up the ball from a backpass. As a result of the backpass rule keepers had to learn how start making better angles to receive the ball and defenders have to pass the ball with the right weight of pass. Goalkeepers have had to adapt to that rule change of the game. I think defenders now have to be smart with the handball rules and adapt.As for the rest of the tournament, it’s been a promising start even if I was a little disappointed to see it wasn’t a full house in Nice for England’s game. I remember at Germany 2011 there were full grounds for all the opening games so hopefully that will improve as the tournament progresses.We’ve now seen most of the contenders in action and despite Brazil’s win against Jamaica on Sunday, I think the best South American team in the tournament could actually be Chile. Brazil ended an eight-game losing streak, without Marta, which is positive but they still have a long way to go to look like a Brazil team capable of going far in the tournament. But of course it’s Brazil, so they could easily prove me wrong.At this stage, the hosts France look like the team to beat. The only question is about their psychological resilience. They have some of the best players in the world but can they hold it together when it matters most, on home soil when the pressure is really on? It will be fascinating to find out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28cdd98188f83fbd0e0a90de7447c0a12efcd635/0_45_1400_840/master/1400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b9b6fbbbf6cf38187430104e5b33cdb","title":"e3 2019 liveblog all the news from ubisoft square enix and the pc gaming show","story":"Ubisoft has announced a new Watch Dogs game set in London in a packed conference, with Avengers and Final Fantasy still to come from Square Enix.More Dragon Quest!

Out July 12th, with a demo arriving on the Playstation store in late June.The remasters keep coming: the 2008 Xbox 360 RPG Last Remnant is coming out on Switch – today. The game was fairly well received back in the day, when it was seen as the last attempt by Microsoft to break the Japanese market.And then we get a release date for another remake: Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, coming to smartphones with online co-op. The original, a Gamecube exclusive, never got the attention it deserved, with a proto-Wii U approach requiring each inidual player to use a Gameboy Advance to manage their action.The immediately after that, the announcement that last year’s throwback Switch exclusive RPG, Octopath Traveller, is coming to PC.And we’re done with Final Fantasy. Next up, a trailer Life is Strange 2, with the sequel to the award winning 2015 adventure game announced as Playable Today.Finally, we see another new trailer for the game. Scenes like Cloud’s motorcycle escape from Midgar, his first meeting with Aerith – and a first look at the remade Tifa. Again, my ears hurt from the volume of the cheers.And then, to cap off the trailer, the first appearance of Sephiroth, the game’s antagonist.Available worldwide, March 3 2020, exclusive to PS4. A “1st Class Edition”, featuring a statue of Cloud on a motorbike, prompts a cry of “take my wallet” from the crowd.Trailer over, Tetsuya Nomura, the game’s director, takes to the stage as well. With the interpreter making four, it’s getting crowded up there.“It has been a while since we’ve had Nomura work so heavily on a project like this,” Kitase says, “so it’s good to see him work with the same passion he had 22 years ago.”Nomura adds, alongside Kitase, his gratitude for those who’ve been “supporting us so patiently,” before revealing a bombshell: the game will be playable at the Square Enix booth during E3. It shouldn’t be that surprising, since we already knew the game was coming in just nine months, but still — this is a moment many thought would never come.And we launch into a new excerpt to finish the first section: the Scorpion Sentinel, the game’s first boss. The fight proceeds as players of the original will remember, but the new battle system really shows its stuff, suggesting that the promises of real tactical action might be justified. That’ll be a relief for those who played Final Fantasy XV’s superficially similar battle system and found themselves mostly button-mashing their way through battles.Where the original fight with the scorpion had a famously dodgy translation that read as a command to “attack while the tail is up”, rather than the warning it was supposed to be, the new version has a different command: take cover behind debris before it fires off its main attack. Positioning your characters isn’t just for show, as it was in Square Enix’s Dragon Quest XI, then.Finally, after first destroying one leg of the Scorpion, Cloud and Barrat take out the boss completely. It plunges off the gantry, to deafening cheers from the crowd.For those who want to avoid menus, “abilities and spells can be bound to shortcuts for immediate action”, but the ATB sticks around regardless.Square Enix’s Neal Pabon takes the stage to introduce the first ever look at gameplay in the remake.“Real-time action merged with strategic combat” is the claim. Tapping the square button will let Cloud hit enemies with his normal attacks, but it will also fill up an ATB bar – when that fills up, the game enters Tactical mode, where players can cast spells and use special abilities.You don’t just play as Cloud: a single button press switches to Barret, Cloud’s gun-handed ally, and Pabon teases that we’ll see Tifa Lockhart “soon”.“To our long-time fans, we thank you for your support and patience over these years,” Kitase says. I don’t speak Japanese well enough to know whether he emphasised “patience” there.“Remaking Final Fantasy VII has allowed us to e much deeper into the world and its titles than ever before. “We anticipate two blu-ray discs full of gameplay content,” he adds, to cheers from the crowd. One of the discs will go further into the history of the world of Final Fantasy VII, suggesting the game has swelled from a remake to a near sequel. A suitably dramatic beginning: the curtain rises to reveal the game-over screen of Final Fantasy VII: NEW GAME or Continue? Another option fades into view: Remake?The crowd laps it up, of course, and we get a brief clip of the same trailer we saw last month, before Yoshinori Kitase, the game’s producer, takes the stage.But enough of the Indie games. The countdown on stage has hit 10 seconds. Time to go.Undermine PC, Xbox One, Switch. Release date: Early access in Summer 2019A pixelated action-adventure roguelike, Undermine’s two-person team has created a game that blends the procedurally-generated rooms of Binding of Isaac with the aesthetics of Spelunky and the hot mining action of Stardew Valley. Each run sees you playing as a new peasant, tasked by a wizard to explore the caverns below your village in order to work out what is causing the dangerous earthquakes that shake your home. Each run will see you die, frequently fairly quickly, but still cart back enough resources to improve your next characters, powering up you pickaxes, boots and armour to endure more challenging tasks.The game will feel familiar to roguelike fans – perhaps too familiar, if what you’re looking for is a whole new experience. But it has polish, and when it launches in early access on Steam this summer, expect it to pick up a following.This indie game, styled as “a cozy management game about dying”, was given a fairly hefty slot at Microsoft’s presser. It sees you playing as Stella, ferrymaster to the deceased, as she sails the sea of the dead, carting spirits to the beyond. That’s the “dying” part – but it’s the “cozy management game” that caught the eye of many.The management part is the bulk of the gameplay: It tasks Stella with building vertically on her boat, to provide abodes for choosy spirits, land for growing crops on, kitchens for cooking meals in and, presumably, more besides. She can fish, farm and literally bottle lightning in order to gather the needed resources.And then there’s the cozy. With its animated 2D look, Spiritfarer has charm in bucketloads. And, while the ten minute hands-on didn’t provide much of a look at the depth of the relationships between the cast, it did show the tone and feel, which is, well, cozy. There may be drama later in the plot, but one gets the sense that if Spiritfarer leaves you feeling anything but warm and fuzzy, the developers will be trying to work out what went wrong.While we wait for Square Enix to start its conference, I’ll run you through a few smaller games on show at the convention that might not have hit headlines, but deserve some attention nonetheless.Alex Hern here, signing on from Los Angeles and warming up my typing fingers for the Square Enix press conference which starts in just twenty minutes time.We’ve already had some pretty major news from the company: a release date for the Final Fantasy VII Remake – and one much closer than anyone expected. During a concert of video game music last night, Square Enix announced that the long-awaited recreation of the PlayStation game will be arriving on March 3, 2020.Until then: here’s all the E3 news so far in one convenient round-up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaeb273c771bb0cbd63ec924f554023bf1d05484/0_239_5256_3154/master/5256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9a438186d2b650597fd2a96a6918abf","title":"ndas routinely used cover up mistreatment work mps say","story":"Commons report warns gagging orders allow unlawful behaviour to continueAllegations of unlawful discrimination and sexual harassment at work are being routinely covered up by employers through secret non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), a report by MPs has warned.The increasingly widespread practice enables perpetrators to carry on mistreating others and prevents victims from discovering or supporting other complaints, according to the Commons’ women and equalities committee.The MPs’ strongly worded report said difficulties in pursuing claims through employment tribunals – where legal aid financial thresholds have rendered legal advice largely unaffordable – meant staff often felt they had little choice but to reach a confidential settlement prohibiting them from speaking out.The use of NDAs to prevent those who have signed them from providing evidence to police inquiries or court proceedings was specifically condemned. “There is clearly potential for NDAs to be negotiated, drafted, andor enforced in ways which may amount to perverting the course of justice,” the report said.NDAs are legally drafted contracts under which employers usually agree to pay departing employees rather than resist a claim at a tribunal, meaning allegations of unlawful discrimination are subject to “routine cover-up” and not properly investigated, MPs said.Maria Miller, the Conservative former culture secretary who chairs the committee, said: “It is particularly worrying that secrecy about allegations of unlawful discrimination is being traded for things that employers should be providing as a matter of course, such as references and remedial action to tackle discrimination.“After signing an NDA, many iniduals find it difficult to work in the same sector again. Some suffer emotional and psychological damage as a result of their experiences, which can affect their ability to work and move on. There is also the financial penalty of losing a job and bringing a case against an employer.“Organisations have a duty of care to provide a safe place of work for their staff and that includes protection from unlawful discrimination.”The committee has urged the government to ensure NDAs cannot prevent legitimate discussion of allegations of unlawful discrimination or harassment and wants it to stop their use in covering up allegations of unlawful discrimination.Some witnesses told the committee NDAs allowed employees to move on with their life and career quickly and quietly, without the stress of going to tribunal. Others suggested confidential agreements delivered higher payments than might be awarded at a tribunal.Joeli Brearley, the founder of the organisation Pregnant Then Screwed, which supports mothers facing workplace discrimination, told MPs there was no incentive for employers to settle without confidentiality.Another problem the report highlighted was that online publication of tribunal judgments had increased the risk for claimants of being blacklisted by future employers. It suggested this was a significant barrier to potential claimants bringing discrimination claims.“We are particularly troubled by the suggestion that ethnic minorities may be disproportionately disadvantaged by the online reporting of tribunal judgments,” the report added.On legal advice, it said: “We are concerned by the lack of affordable legal advice available for employment discrimination cases … The government should review legal aid thresholds and monitor the effect of the changes it is making to improve access to legal aid.”The committee called on the government to begin a programme to raise awareness among employers and employees about how to handle grievances fairly and effectively, including signposting to relevant guidance and support.It also suggested ministers should consider requiring employers to investigate all discrimination and harassment complaints regardless of whether a settlement is reached.The report also called on the government to legislate to require employers to provide, as a minimum, a basic reference for any former employee confirming they worked for that employer and the dates of their employment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96624dfa687d87a05f16c5cd2fbc3a7468e1abe7/0_74_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73cdeb9f63cd2eafe0ab2a35ed9fc95a","title":"bbc confirms plans to make over 75s pay licence fee","story":"Three million households expected to lose right to free licence next June The BBC has confirmed plans to make most over-75s pay the TV licence fee, arguing that it is the only way to avoid closing channels and making substantial cutbacks.Millions of households will have to start paying £154.50 a year from June 2020 for the right to watch live television and access the BBC’s iPlayer service.Research from the House of Commons Library found that 3 million households would lose their free TV licence as a result of the decision. The BBC has said it will continue to provide TV licences to over-75s who can provide evidence that they claim pension credit, a means-tested benefit designed to help older people.However, up to 1.3 million families who are entitled to receive pension credit do not claim the benefit, according to official government figures, suggesting many poor households will be hit hard by the change.Charities including Age UK have said some elderly viewers will be pushed into relative poverty by the decision, with concerns over whether older viewers will be able or willing to prove they are receiving benefits. It is also likely to result in the criminal prosecution of elderly Britons who do not or are not able to pay.“It’s a massive hardship for millions of people,” said Claire Enders of Enders Analysis. “The really vulnerable won’t apply for this benefit – the disabled and lone females do not apply for benefits. And that will be true for this as well.”The policy of free TV licences for the over-75s was introduced in 1999 by the then Labour chancellor, Gordon Brown, with the cost met by the government, which paid the BBC to provide the service.However, in 2015 the Conservative government, guided by George Osborne, struck a deal under which the subsidy would be phased out by 2020, with the broadcaster having to shoulder the cost of free TV licences.The government later gave the BBC responsibility for deciding what to do about the benefit, meaning any unpopular decisions on charging over-75s had to be made by the BBC rather than ministers.A consultation was launched at the end of 2018, with the BBC arguing that many over-75s were increasingly wealthy and it could not afford the cost of providing them with a service for free.The corporation argued that the £745m annual cost of maintaining the status quo would have taken up a fifth of its budget, equal to the total amount it spends on all of BBC Two, BBC Three, BBC Four, the BBC News channel, CBBC and CBeebies. The BBC estimates that the new proposal will cost it £250m a year, requiring some cuts but no channel closures.The BBC director general, Tony Hall, said the decision to means test the free TV licence would protects those most in need, adding: “This has not been an easy decision. Whilst we know that pensioner incomes have improved since 2000, we also know that for some the TV licence is a lot of money.“I believe we have reached the fairest judgment after weighing up all the different arguments. It would not be right simply to abolish all free licences. Equally it would not be right to maintain it in perpetuity given the very profound impact that would have on many BBC services.”Hall also said the licence fee settlement should never again be agreed in secret. He said: “The last two settlements have been made in the dark and without proper consultation. It is vital that future decisions are evidence-based and made after proper consultation and scrutiny. We need to find a better way.”The BBC is battling to maintain its main source of funding while also remaining relevant to younger viewers. The average age of a BBC One viewer is now 60-plus, meaning many people who consume the broadcaster’s content are currently viewing it for free.Both the 2015 and 2017 Conservative manifestos pledged to maintain free TV licences for the over-75s, although the party has since dismissed the latter pledge as a mistake.The BBC decided to announce the change on a day when multiple Conservative leadership candidates formally launched their campaigns, turning the issue into a potential issue in the leadership race, as hopefuls compete for the votes of older Tory party members.The shadow culture secretary, Tom Watson, said he would continue to fight the decision, drawing comparisons with Boris Johnson’s proposed tax cuts for high earners.He said: “You cannot means test for social isolation. You cannot means test for loneliness. Millions of elderly and isolated people will lose because of this announcement – Labour will fight it with everything we’ve got.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68b041247288166738784414ad682fca11031644/0_141_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20c95e67b7fc46ac980f023c6af5e8b8","title":"seeds of bbc licence fee decision deftly planted by george osborne","story":"Deal struck with BBC in 2015 was a win-win-win for Tory governmentGeorge Osborne left government in 2016, and parliament exactly two years ago. But as the BBC announces that most over-75s will have to start paying the £154.50 television licence fee, the legacy of the former chancellor’s spending cuts is still being felt.The seeds of the licence fee decision lie in a secret deal struck in the immediate aftermath of the 2015 general election, when the Conservatives returned with an unexpected parliamentary majority.With the Liberal Democrats no longer in coalition, an uninhibited Tory government moved fast to impose new spending controls – hashing out a new settlement with the BBC director general, Tony Hall, in clandestine talks that lasted just a week. Under the agreement, the BBC would receive some funding boosts in return for taking the potentially financially ruinous responsibility for providing services to the over-75s.Osborne’s politically deft move was to shift not only the cost of the licence fees for the elderly on to the BBC but also, after a short while, the responsibility for deciding whether the benefit should exist at all. It was a win-win-win for the Conservatives: the BBC would be financially weakened, the Treasury would have more money, and the public would blame the BBC when the axe finally fell.The axe fell this week. This time it was Hall – who back in 2015 had warned there would “be hard choices” as a result of the deal he helped to strike – who made the announcement that most over-75s would have to start paying for BBC services unless they claim pension credit.Age UK points out that many poor over-75s who are eligible to claim pension credit do not do so, because they are put off by the paperwork or refrain from applying on a point of pride. BBC sources optimistically suggest that the decision to bundle in a free TV licence will drive uptake of the wider benefit.Extraordinarily, the Conservatives’ 2015 broken manifesto pledge to keep the licence fee free for over-75s was copied and pasted word for word into the party’s 2017 general election manifesto. The party later said this was a mistake, apparently made in a hurry because the manifesto’s authors were rushing to produce a policy platform on a tight deadline due to Theresa May’s decision to call a snap vote.Although the BBC insists that the announcement had been planned before the Tory leadership election, unveiling the decision on the same day that candidates formally declared inevitably turned the licence fee into a live political issue.A Downing Street spokesperson said May was “very disappointed” with the BBC’s decision and urged the broadcaster to reconsider, with government sources highlighting the high pay of many BBC executives as a potential alternative saving.To complicate matters further, Northern Ireland’s DUP – no friend of the BBC – has strongly supported the continuation of the free licence fee, making the issue a potential negotiating chip in negotiations between the party and the Tories under the next Conservative leader.Osborne is now a journalist, having to make cuts to staff at the Evening Standard that he edits. But his political legacy leaves a conundrum for Conservative leadership candidates: do they stay quiet and hope the issue of BBC funding goes away, weakening an institution that some view as a leftwing ideological enemy?Or do they make a campaign pledge to restore the BBC’s funding, in a move that will benefit many older voters – who overwhelmingly vote Conservative and might just have a party membership card, which allows them to choose the next prime minister?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5436f62ef0d8fcef8742fac5d53941039d90a67a/0_103_2896_1737/master/2896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f84ecb5b665ba75ebde8d127a16fefb","title":"totally unjustifiable older readers on losing free tv licence","story":"After BBC announced that most over-75s will have to pay, we hear from some of those affectedI am a 98-year-old widow and live on my own. Both my children work, so I am on my own all day. I have very poor balance thus cannot walk, and I no longer drive, so the TV is company for me. My hearing is poor so I cannot rely upon the radio. The combination of pictures and sound keep me in touch with what is going on in the world. When I began drawing my pension 33 years ago, I thought I had plenty. Over time my pension has not kept pace with inflation, so I have to be particularly frugal. I would probably have to say no to purchasing a TV licence. Evelyn, 98, WokingHaving reached the age of 75 last year it now looks like the benefit I derive from the free licence will be short-lived. Given the choices available to the BBC I think they have gone for a pragmatic least worst option. The real culprit here is the Tory government after its decision to load the BBC with the cost of the benefit created by Gordon Brown as one element in a government budget package intended to help those less able to provide for themselves.  is right to highlight the fact that while the government-initiated removal of the free TV licence is now going ahead, Boris Johnson is promising an increase in the higher-rate tax threshold to £80,000. You couldn’t make it up. Robert, 76, BuckinghamshireMy wife is old enough for us not to pay the licence fee but in June 2020 we will have to start paying. I believe this is the right decision for us as we can well afford to pay the fee as we both have index-linked pensions. It makes sense that only pensioners on pension credit should receive the benefit but I feel sorry for those pensioners whose income only just exceeds the pension credit limit and those who are entitled to pension credit but do not claim it. Every effort should be made to encourage those who are entitled to claim pension credit. Tom Misselbrook, 70, HerefordshireOf 37 countries surveyed in a 2017 OECD review it was reported that Britain was at the very bottom of the state pension league table. Pensioners, many of whom live in isolation, rely on television as their only contact with the outside world. Free TV licences for the over-75s must be retained as one part of a caring and compassionate social system. George Osborne’s decision to make the BBC responsible for what should clearly be a responsibility of government was, and remains, totally unjustifiable. The government must be made to accept that it cannot subcontract its social policies. Haydn Richard Watkins, 82, HampshireI am single, living on a fixed personal pension. This charge if introduced suddenly will only just be covered by the increase in my statutory state pension. Whilst accepting that the money has to come from somewhere, I do feel that the government has welshed on the original deal and at best should phase it in over a five-year period. James Underwood, 81, WiltshireI’m disgusted, to say the least, as the BBC programming is so much repeats that I rarely watch the BBC channels but I will still have to pay for licence. I like watching sport but the BBC is getting less coverage of sporting occasions, especially rugby. I am an 81-year-old widow, living alone. I live in a development of flats with neighbours of a similar age, and many residents are unable to go out, so TV is a lifeline. Those of us who have saved for our retirement are again being made to lose out.

His comments were a direct counter to Corbyn, who had earlier called for MPs not to publicly attack staff or the shadow cabinet.That comment from Corbyn led several MPs to shout, “She’s sitting next to you” and point to shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, who was demoted from her usual slot standing in for Corbyn at PMQs after she criticised the party’s Brexit policy on election night.In his speech before the interventions, the Labour leader said the party must unite to take on the “dangerously damaging policies” of the Tory leadership candidates, including tax cuts that will benefit the richest, attacks on abortion rights, and a “race-to-the-bottom no-deal Brexit”.He said Labour was committed to working cross-party to stop no deal. “To break the Brexit deadlock, we need to go back to the people. Let the people decide the country’s future, either in a general election or through a public vote on any deal agreed by parliament,” he said.One Corbyn ally said they had been taken aback by the tone of the criticism. A Labour source called the meeting “robust”, but said it had not been worse than previous meetings.“Clearly, there are very strong feelings about Brexit and how it should be handled, both in the Labour party and the country – and among Labour MPs. That’s no secret at all,” the source said.“We are in a period of heightened polarisation on Brexit, and that is why Jeremy is trying to find a way that reflects our conference policy and that brings the country together. We are listening to the views of members and our MPs … The PLP is very passionate, and that’s what we would expect.”Corbyn’s comments about ending the criticism of staff were taken to refer to Karie Murphy, his chief of staff, who was criticised in leaked emails for her apparent handling of two harassment complaints, one against senior Labour aide David Prescott and another against Pete Willsman, a member of Labour’s ruling national executive committee who has since been suspended over allegations of antisemitism.Jess Phillips, the chair of the Women’s PLP, told the meeting the revelations were shameful. “If you abuse women in the Labour party and they’re a friend of yours, they get away with it,” she said, according to MPs in the room. Corbyn robustly denied that was the case, saying she should not have suggested that.MPs also expressed alarm that Corbyn’s opening speech failed to mention the investigation into antisemitism in the party that has been launched by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.The party’s handling of antisemitism cases was compared with the automatic expulsion of the former spin doctor Alastair Campbell for admitting he had voted Lib Dem in the European elections. Labour MP Wes Streeting suggested this was a double standard.Labour’s new Peterborough MP, Lisa Forbes, apologised to MPs at the meeting for liking Facebook posts that referred to “Zionist slavemasters”. But MPs including Margaret Hodge said Forbes had failed to address another aspect of the complaints, her signing of a letter criticising the adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of antisemitism.Forbes said she had written to Jewish community groups and hoped to meet the Board of Deputies and the Jewish Labour Movement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab309586e55bd02f5ee85455752643cf5918b5e/0_2614_3370_2021/master/3370.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28f1928947d8c7bea65c453b3c93bace","title":"share your experiences of sure start childrens centres","story":"Whether you helped set up the programme in your area or your family used a centre near you, we would like to hear your storiesThe flagship Sure Start programme has saved the NHS millions of pounds through the benefits it has brought to children including some of the most deprived areas and reducing the number of those taken to hospital, according to a study.Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies “found that where Sure Start offered high levels of service in poor neighbourhoods in England, visits to hospital to treat injuries fell among all children of primary school age, and by a third of all 11-year-olds”.Tracy Brabin, the shadow early years minister, said: “This research shows the critical role Sure Start plays in children’s health, as well as their development. But shamefully, over a thousand Sure Start centres have been lost through years of austerity, meaning children and families across the country are missing out.”According to a 2018 study by the Sutton Trust, as many as 1,000 Sure Start children’s centres may have been shut down in England since 2010.What does Sure Start mean to you?

Why is she spending her time on this?’” Osipova sighs. “I felt quite vulnerable. Why am I not understood?”Some of her fans might not be ready to accompany the Russian ballerina on her odyssey into experimental dance, but Osipova is an artist who trusts her instincts: from her 2001 decision to walk out of one of the world’s most prestigious ballet companies, the Bolshoi, in favour of a second-tier institution, the Mikhailovsky Theatre, to launching a parallel career in contemporary dance while still one of the top classical ballerinas.Now a principal with the Royal Ballet, and boasting a nonstop freelance schedule on the side, Osipova is a powerful dancer of explosive jumps and dramatic intensity. Her passion and self-belief give the title to Force of Nature Natalia, a new documentary by director Gerry Fox that follows Osipova as she rehearses for three shows: La Bayadère at the Royal Ballet The Mother, Arthur Pita’s dark retelling of the Hans Christian Andersen story and a new duet created with dancer and Osipova’s fiance Jason Kittelberger, more of whom later.We meet at her flat in Little Venice, London – smart modern decor and the feel of someone who’s not home much – where we are joined by an interpreter and two over-excited dogs. Osipova, 33, is very straightforward, not starry or effusive – unlike when she gets on stage, when she’ll propel herself towards dramatic extremes. The Mother, a two-hander based on the bleak tale of a woman desperately trying to save her dying baby, often leaves Osipova bloodied and bruised from its physical floorwork and emotionally tested trying to reach the heart of the character.“I’m not a mother myself yet,” she says, “so I was anxious that it wouldn’t be a realistic portrayal because I don’t know what it’s like.” It’s similar to how you feel about your dogs, I tell her, but times a hundred. “It’s funny you make that comparison,” she laughs, “because when we got them, they were just puppies, two months old. And in a way, my feeling about them fed into the part.”We talk about how rare it is in dance to depict something other than romantic love. “Traditionally in ballet,” she says, “you are expressing love for a man and there are very few exceptions. In my career, I can only think of Kenneth MacMillan’s Anastasia.” (Premiered in 1967, Anastasia is about a woman who claimed to be the daughter of tsar Nicholas II.) “In contemporary,” Osipova adds, “it’s different. Sometimes we speak just about physiology, sexuality …” She pauses and laughs. “But the men are always there somewhere!”Of course, two people, two bodies connecting, is something dance can express well. But Osipova is as interested in showing the realities of relationships as well as the fairytale ideals. Last year, in her self-curated programme Pure Dance, she and Kittelberger performed Roy Assaf’s Six Years Later, a portrait of a tired and tetchy relationship, in which, the noted New York Times critic Siobhan Burke, Kittelberger emerged as an equal to the charismatic Osipova on stage.Dancing with Kittelberger was a revelation for Osipova. “It was so, so different to dancing with a classical dancer,” she says. “It was like a real person, really touching me, and it was like, ‘Mmmm!’” Her bright eyes widen with mischief at the memory. “It was electrifying. He really showed me a different way of experiencing dance.”Gerry Fox, who filmed the couple dancing in the studio, talks about their “sensual tension, two people giving their all through their bodies and being so free with each other”. Osipova has danced with many notable partners, including former boyfriends Ivan Vasiliev and Sergei Polunin, but this was different. “So different,” she says. The film sees them working on a new creation, I’m Fine, about the ups and downs of a relationship. “The title comes from me personally, when I’m irritated or angry – saying ‘I’m fine!’ when it’s clear I’m not.” Kittelberger created the steps (“That’s not my strong point”) and Osipova was dramaturg. “I’m more sensitive to the story,” she says. “I’m strong on interpretation. That’s the gift I have.”Kittelberger provides Osipova with essential support off stage as well as on. “If I’m in an intense project, I become more needy,” she says. “I need more comfort, and if I don’t get it I become resentful. I need a lot of attention, especially from men – maybe because my father had such a comforting, amazing energy. Jason really gets it and gives me everything I need.“He does see a bit of the child in me, in a good way. I’m very aware of my own power. Physically and emotionally, I’m a really strong person, in art and in life. But there are times when you want to totally give it away and be helpless, and he’s somebody who can allow me to do that.”As well as exploring her adventures in contemporary dance, Fox’s documentary discusses one of Osipova’s most feted classical roles: Giselle, the beautiful young peasant girl who falls for a deceitful nobleman. “Giselle,” Osipova tells the camera at one point, “it’s me.” What did she mean? “It’s the most natural part for me,” she says. “The second act is so close to me, as if I have it somewhere in my DNA.”Osipova is not the ghostly spirit of a wronged woman, as Giselle becomes in act two, but her entire physicality alters as she embodies the role – a more vivid, chilling and unhuman Giselle than any I’ve seen. “When I started dancing it, I was 19 or 20, and I was doing it in a very non-traditional way. My teachers would be telling me off, but I had such an inner certainty that it was impossible to knock it out of me.” Where does that confidence come from? “From my deep connection to the part – and my peaceful certainty that this is how it should be.”When Osipova began her career at the Bolshoi, the director was Alexei Ratmansky, “who gave quite a lot of freedom”. But when he was succeeded by Sergei Filin, Osipova found herself unhappy in Moscow, her opportunities restricted. She’s content now at the Royal Ballet, a company with a healthier culture than most she has experienced. “The first time I came I was surprised there was no intrigue or conflict, and people were nice to each other,” she says. “It’s my fifth season now and I’ve had not a single conflict. Sometimes people say I just don’t get enough of the language to know!” She laughs. “But in other companies, you can sense it, when people are envious, or don’t want you to be there, or they’re talking behind your back. I can’t work like that.”The pressure, the egos, the intensity of a dancer’s life have certainly been blamed for more than one artistic outburst. Osipova’s ex, Polunin, is a case in point, with his recent macho and fat-shaming tirades online. The controversial dancer had this to say about male dancers: “Females now trying to take on the man role because you don’t f––– them and because you are an embarrassment.” He also wrote: “Let’s slap fat people.”Osipova has gone on record saying Polunin is a good guy who should be judged only on his dancing. Why does she think he is so frequently self-destructive? “No one but him can answer your question,” she says. “He’s clearly gifted, and I really wish that he nurtures it rather than undermines it.”Osipova seems able to harness all the drama and drive for her dancing and thinks she has another five years of performing at her peak. “At the moment, I feel very mature and capable, emotionally and physically,” she says. “Contemporary dance is making my body feel and move differently. It’s a really good time for me now.”• The Mother is at Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, 20-22 June. Force of Nature Natalia is out now and will be broadcast on Sky Arts on 18 June.

This article represents hundreds of hours of testing by the author to bring together a succinct list of recommended products or services so you can pick from the best and ignore the rest without having to do hours of your own research.While the  may earn a small commission from items bought through affiliate links, the items featured in this buyer\u0027s guide have been tested and included without influence from any advertiser or commercial initiative.The latest superphone undercuts the competition on price while offering a better experience in almost every meaningful way. The OnePlus 7 Pro is the firm’s biggest yet with a monster 6.67in QHD+ AMOLED screen, which is arguably the best on any phone. It runs at a refresh rate of 90Hz – compared with 60Hz for the competition – which makes everything from scrolling through lists to smashing through games super slick.The screen is edge-to-edge in every direction too, lacking any intrusions by the notches plaguing rivals as the selfie camera has been moved to a motorised module that pops out of the top of the phone when needed.Speed is the name of the game. The OnePlus 7 Pro is the fastest-feeling smartphone by miles. Part of that is the firm’s excellent version of Android 9 Pie called OxygenOS, which is on-par with Google’s on the Pixels, and the other is the top-of-the-line hardware.It has Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 855 processor, at least 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. But that storage is also much faster than rivals using the new UFS3.0 standard, and the difference in day-to-day usage is palpable.Even the optical in-display fingerprint scanner is the best in the business, beating that on the Huawei P30 Pro and matching traditional capacitive sensors for speed.The triple camera system on the back matches rivals combining a 48MP main, a 16MP ultra-wide angle and an 8MP telephoto camera. It can’t beat the P30 Pro, but it matches or beats the rest on detail and utility.Battery life is good, but not Huawei-beating. It charges really fast using OnePlus’s WarpCharge system, but there’s no wireless charging, which is a shame. It is water resistant to some extent, but doesn’t have an IP rating. It has dual-sim support in most markets too.The unrivalled screen, sheer speed and in-display fingerprint scanner, combined with the slick OxygenOS, make even mundane tasks a joy. The massive OnePlus 7 Pro is most definitely a stretch to use, but it’s a stretch worth makingBuy if: you want the best and fastest superphone experienceDon’t buy if: you don’t want to stretch to such a big phoneThe best iPhone is not the biggest or most expensive. The iPhone XS combines a stunning, good-size 5.8in screen, svelte body and top-notch performance into the most appealing package from Apple to date.Apple’s Face ID is the best face recognition system in the business, the dual-camera system on the back is excellent, as is the performance of the A12 Bionic processor and the class-leading gesture navigation system of iOS, which has replaced the home button of iPhones of yore.You’re also in line for about five years of software updates, which is likely at least two more than any other brand of phone. The iPhone XS is a metal and glass sandwich, and will smash just like the competition when dropped, but the stainless steel sides and glass back exude a luxury feel not matched by other phones. Sadly most will put it in a case.The biggest downsides are the price, which at £1,000 is likely significantly more than the competition, and battery life, which only manages about a day of medium usage. The iPhone XS has wireless charging and supports fast charging via a USB-C to Lightning cable, but only ships with a slow charger in the box. Its cellular modem performance is also not as good as competitors, struggling more to keep a working 4G data connection in congested areas, particularly compared with the Mate 20 Pro.If you’re locked in to iOS, or want the longest software update coverage, then the iPhone XS is the best Apple smartphone you can buy (and not very far behind the Mate 20 Pro overall), thanks to its combination of size, camera, capability and luxurious feel.Buy if: you want the best iPhoneDon’t buy if: you don’t want to spend £999 or want to use AndroidIf you want the sweet-spot between a big, stunning screen and smaller phone size that’s easier to handle and fit in a pocket, that’s the Galaxy S10.The 6.1in QHD+ AMOLED screen with a small hole-punch notch in the top right is one of the very best on the market and is big enough to make the most of apps and movies look great.Small bezels all round make the phone pretty compact compared to rivals, and it’s light too. It’s still a glass and metal sandwich, which means you might need a case to protect against falls.The ultrasonic fingerprint sensor mounted under the display works well, although it’s no longer the fastest on the market.Samsung’s new One UI software, based on Android 9 Pie, is a big leap in making large phone easier to use, putting things you have to touch toward the bottom of the screen and information towards the top. Samsung also gives you the choice of traditional navigation keys or swipe gestures.You should see around three-years of software support from Samsung, although the company is often slow to deliver big Android version updates.The rear triple camera is one of the best allowing you to zoom from 0.5 through 2x, and on to a 10x hybrid zoom. It won’t beat the Huawei P30 Pro, but it keeps up with rest. The selfie camera pokes straight though the screen and is one of the best on the market.Performance is good, but battery life is the S10’s one weakness. It will last a day of usage but not much more. There’s both cable and fast wireless charging to top up during the day and the wireless power share feature turns the phone into an ad-hoc wireless charger for other devices.The big, beautiful screen in a comparatively small phone is the main selling point, but the good camera, performance and looks help tooBuy if: you want the best balance of big screen and small phoneDon’t buy if: you want brilliant battery lifeThe best camera on a phone is the Huawei P30 Pro by some margin. No other phone provides as comprehensive a combination as Huawei’s new Leica quad camera.The 20MP 0.6x ultra-wide angle camera is fun, the main 1x 40MP camera is terrific and it’s joined by a new periscopic 5x optical zoom camera that gets you closer than any other smartphone. If five times magnification wasn’t enough, there’s an excellent 10x hybrid zoom on top and then a digital zoom all the way up to 50x. A 3D depth-sensing time-of-flight sensor rounds out the modules on the back.Remarkable levels of zoom aside, the P30 Pro also has game-changing low-light performance that instantly turns night into day without having to wait for a couple of seconds of capture.The rest of the phone is excellent too with stunning colour options. The large 6.47in FHD+ OLED is one of the best, with a small notch in the top containing the selfie camera and slim bezels all-round. The curved edges keep the width of the phone to a narrow 73.4mm wide, meaning it’s still relatively manageable and easier to wield day-to-day particularly compared to the OnePlus 7 Pro or iPhone XS Max.The in-screen optical fingerprint sensor is second only to the OnePlus 7 Pro’s. Huawei’s top-notch Kirin 980 processor, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, provides great performance and a battery that’ll last around two days. Plus charges the fastest and has wireless charging and power sharing.Huawei’s modified Android 9 Pie, EMUI 9.1, is highly customisable and has plenty of features but may not be to everyone’s tastes. Huawei is currently facing sanctions from the US as part of the US-China trade war, which makes its future uncertain. The P30 Pro should continue to receive updates as normal, however.The camera is game-changing in meaningful, not gimmick-filled ways, while the rest of the phone is excellentBuy if: you want the best camera on a great phoneDon’t buy if: you want a smaller phone or are worried about US blockade of HuaweiIf you want a massive, top-spec phone, but don’t want to spend £900, then the OnePlus 6T is the one to buy.It has a big and beautiful 6.41in full HD OLED screen, a tiny widows peak-like notch for the selfie camera, slim bezels all round and a good-feeling metal and glass construction matching the quality of most others.It has a top-of-the-line processor, 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage and 30-hour battery life too. The Android experience on the OnePlus, Oxygen OS, is second only to Google’s on the Pixel it is brutally quick and smooth in operation. OnePlus guarantees two years of software updates and an additional year of security updates from the release date of the phone.It even has the cutting-edge in-display fingerprint scanner, which is almost as good as the best dedicated capacitive sensors, and dual-sim support for having two mobile phone network connections at the same time.The downsides are a good, but not great, camera that doesn’t quite match the competition here, no formal water resistance rating and no wireless charging.A massive and great screen with tiny bezels, excellent software and performance, in-display fingerprint scanner and a good-but-not-great camera mean you have to spend significantly more to get a better phone than this.Buy if: you want a top-notch phone but don’t want to spend more than £500Don’t buy if: you want a really good cameraSmartphones are rated by screen size measured on the diagonal in inches. The bigger the number the larger the phone, but different phones use different ratios of height to width.How easy it is to handle comes down to the width of the phone and its weight. The narrower and lighter it is, the easier it is to hold in one hand and the less likely you are to drop it.What is commonly called the processor in a phone is actually a system-on-a-chip combining the processor, graphics and other essential systems into one.Generally the newer the processor the more powerful and battery efficient it will be. Samsung, Huawei and Apple make their own, while Qualcomm is the largest supplier to other brands at the high end, with its Snapdragon 8-series range at the top.The RAM (memory) is where your apps and processes are stored when in use, so the you more your phone has the better, up to a point.Android requires more RAM than iOS, so it\u0027s difficult to directly compare them. But with Android at least 4GB of RAM is currently recommended.Different from memory, storage is where everything is stored on the phone, including apps and media. While a few phones can have their storage expanded with microSD cards, most cannot.That means you should aim for 64GB of storage at a minimum, but more if you want to store lots of photos. Cloud services such as Spotify or Google\u0027s Photos can help offload your music, photos or videos to the internet.Keeping your phone secure from hackers is essential, which makes software updates critical to patch bugs and security holes, as well as adding new features and improving things such as battery life and the camera.Not all phones receive regular updates. Apple\u0027s support of older phones is the best in the business of around 5 years, followed by Samsung and Google\u0027s three years, both from when the phone was released - not when you buy it.Battery life varies drastically between devices, and all-day battery often doesn\u0027t mean 24 hours between charges. Some may not last long enough, particularly if you\u0027re out in the evening.Battery life gets worse as the battery ages too, so a two-day battery will likely make sure the phone lasts at least a day two years later.Cameras are the current battleground between the big players, but the margins between them are slimming.Most use computational photography that combines hardware with advanced software algorithms, typically allowing multiple cameras to combine to make one image.As such the camera software makes as much difference as the hardware, and is one of the few areas that actually improves over time with updates.Multi-camera systems often offer more, such as useful zooms, portrait modes and better low-light performance, but they are not all created equally. There are also 3D cameras, which can detect facial expressions and other fun tricks.The number of megapixels (MP) also makes a difference. Having more MP doesn\u0027t necessarily equal a better image, but modern smartphone cameras combine multiple pixels to improve image quality producing 12MP shots from 48MP sensors, for example.Wireless charging:\u0026nbspconvenient, but slower than via cable and normally a charging pad doesn\u0027t come in the boxDurability:\u0026nbspgenerally glass on the front and back of the phone makes it more fragileResale value:\u0026nbspiPhones hold their value better than most othersOLED versus LCD: OLED screens emit their own light so have much deeper blacks and more vibrant colours, while LCD screens are cheaperThese are good phones still worth buying if none of the top four smartphones fit the bill.Apple’s slightly cheaper iPhone XR offers most of the features of the iPhone XS. It has better battery life too, but has a worse camera, a slightly larger, but worse screen and is made of aluminium and glass, instead of stainless steel, losing its luxurious feel and the knowledge that it’s the best Apple can make.The iPhone XR looks stunning in red, but it’s not cheap by any stretch of the imagination, costing as much or more as true flagship phones from competitors. The iPhone XS still the one to buy if you want an iPhone, but if you want to save money, switch to Android.If you must have an iPhone and it must have a massive screen, then the iPhone XS Max is your only option. But it’s even more expensive and bigger and heavier, making it pretty difficult to handle day-to-day, meaning the smaller iPhone XS is the better option.The bigger version of the Galaxy S10 with a 6.4in QHD+ display has the best screen available on any device. The oval-shaped hole-punch notch is novel, containing two good selfie cameras. The triple rear camera is good, but not a patch on the Huawei P30 Pro. Performance is good, so is the software, but the battery life is slightly disappointing compared with the best.Samsung’s Galaxy Note 9 offers something a bit different, with long battery life, a massive screen and the all-important S Pen stylus. If you’re looking for a productivity powerhouse, the Note 9 is it. But it’s also huge with a slightly dated design.The Mate 20 Pro has the big, attractive 6.39in QHD+ screen, svelte body, long battery life and great performance that made it the top phone of 2018. However, its excellent triple camera system with 3x optical zoom has been outdone by Huawei’s newer P30 Pro, which has a Leica quad camera with 5x optical zoom. It is worth looking out for deals, particularly if you want the 3D face unlock option.Huawei’s Honor brand has made a name for itself cut-price but good phones. The View20 is the best phone it has ever made and is cracking value at just £500.It has a top-of-the-line Huawei Kirin 980 processor (as seen in the Mate 20 Pro), a good-looking 6.4in FHD+ LCD screen, plenty of storage, 6 or 8GB of RAM, a super-quick fingerprint scanner on the back and it even still has a headphone socket. Standout features are a hole-punch notch in the screen, through which an excellent 25MP selfie camera pokes, and a really great 48MP camera on the back.Fast charging, long battery life, great in-hand feel and a wild light-reflecting V-shaped pattern in the glass back round out the highlights. Honor’s Magic UI 2, based on Android 9 Pie, is not quite as good as OnePlus’s OxygenOS, but at least you get two to three years of updates.Out of the two £500 top-end phones, buy the Honor View20 if you want a better camera buy the OnePlus 6T if you want a better user experience and software.The Pixel 3 is all about Google’s camera and software. The 5.5in OLED screen is small by 2019’s standards and has large bezels at the top and bottom, which make the phone bigger than it needs to be and give it a dated look.But Google’s fantastic single rear camera, excellent software and fast updates are worth buying into. Performance is good but battery life is a bit weak. Buy if you want a smaller phone and the Samsung Galaxy S10 isn’t for you.The larger Google Pixel 3 XL has everything that makes the Pixel 3 a really great phone, but is bigger with a huge notch at the top of the screen. It’s more difficult to handle than its smaller sibling and is more expensive, but has slightly better battery life. If you like the Pixel 3 but want a bigger screen, this is the phone for you, but on the whole the smaller version is a better device for most people. The Mate 20 Pro is a better big-screen phone all round.Xiaomi’s first slider phone offers more than most for the money, with top-flight specs for 2018 competing directly with the OnePlus 6T and Honor View20. It takes a different approach to the problem of where to put the selfie camera in an all-screen design, hiding it behind the screen on slide-out section.Good, but quite as great as its competition, this huge phone is held back by a heavy weight and a software experience that just isn’t as good, despite solid gesture navigation options.Nokia 8 Sirocco – Good software but average design and camera – £600Razer Phone 2 - Gaming phone beast that falls down on camera performance – £500Sony Xperia XZ3 – Good, but not great phone that misses the mark – £699LG G7 – uninspiring design and software that’s not as good as rivals – £375 This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Major spoilers aheadNow in its fifth series, Black Mirror has firmly established itself as concerned with theories rather than feelings: as a growing fable collection pondering our futile, fixated romance with technology that doesn’t love us back, it stands to reason that Charlie Brooker’s neo-Twilight Zone creation is predominantly glass-cool rather than skin-warm to the touch. Even its ruminations on human relationships have largely been on the chilly, impersonal side – preoccupied less with the machinations of the human heart than the machines (or simulations) that manage to manipulate it.Series three’s San Junipero was a clear, glowing exception. Its tender, shimmery story of a lesbian romance crossing from a real world into a virtual one – and finally, movingly, into a manufactured afterlife – examined outlandish futuristic technology to enable a relationship between sympathetic, flesh-and-blood women, rather than using them as props in a 21st-century parable. Critically beloved and lavished with Emmy awards, it could have been labelled as Black Mirror for people who don’t really like Black Mirror, or as an indication of a clever, slightly clinical series’ expanding world view: by putting two queer female characters at the centre of its narrative, and allowing them to be served by its genre mechanics rather than the other way round, it felt like something of a landmark.So why does the series five opener Striking Vipers – seemingly fashioned as the fraternal companion piece to San Junipero – feel so hollow by comparison? Like its predecessor, also written by Brooker and directed with ambient eeriness by Owen Harris, the episode studies same-sex attraction as it functions in the real world and a simulated reality where real-world restrictions and prejudices don’t exist. As in San Junipero, too, that attraction flourishes most happily in the artificial sphere. In Striking Vipers, however, the feelings between its part-time lovers appear to change between dimensions – not least because their bodies (and, in one case, gender) are likewise transformed.Best friends Danny (Anthony Mackie) and Karl (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) enjoy an entirely platonic relationship for years, growing more amiably distant until a virtual-reality combat game brings them unprecedentedly close. As his fighting avatar, Karl adopts the body of a woman, Roxette, while Danny takes the male form of karate master Lance the ensuing combat is visceral, oddly arousing, and before long, Roxette and Lance are having in-game sex. Does that mean Karl and Danny are fucking too? Not in person, as their physical bodies remain slumped and separate on the couch while they’re locked into the VR world, but they feel and savour the sensation. Does it count? And if it counts, is it gay, even if Roxette and Lance aren’t?These are complex questions that Brooker’s script, to its credit, does not seek to answer tidily. Yet there’s a stale whiff of “no-homo” coyness to the way Striking Vipers dramatises two ostensibly straight men’s flirtations with homosexuality and genderqueer indentity. Watching it, I was reminded of nothing so much as Lynn Shelton’s 2009 mumblecore comedy Humpday, a distinctly analogue exercise in which two straight male friends mutually dare each other to make a gay porn film together, each bro calling the other’s bluff until they mutually agree to chicken out. It was an amiable film that nonetheless received an undue amount of discussion for gently returning its characters to heteronormative safety before any serious taboos had been broken, preserving same-sex intimacy as a daunting, sacred final frontier.Striking Vipers goes further in pushing the boundary between male friendship and something more, though it also positions the VR world as a firm red line in Danny and Karl’s relationship. There, as a heterosexual pair of fighting gods, they are sexually liberated while ironically conforming, on the artificial surface, to social norms back in reality, an experimental kiss between the two men is mutually agreed to be a non-arousing non-starter. If their body language subtly suggests otherwise, the script lets the matter lie.As befits the Black Mirror brand, Striking Vipers is fascinated by its fantasy, which is rather ingeniously rendered as a high-kitsch parody of the hyper-macho, culturally dubious Mortal Kombat “orientalism” so prevalent in the video game realm. Yet its human detailing is comparatively skimpy, leaving Danny and Karl scarcely more dimensional than their VR avatars: queer desire is treated, even exoticised, as a disorienting byproduct of alien technology rather than a matter of the heart, while the psychological ramifications of Karl inhabiting a woman’s body to feel sexual fulfilment are glibly grazed over. As ever, Black Mirror excels in presenting big, subversive ideas in a grabby, sexy, hour-long format for big, subversive feelings to match, however, San Junipero remains its high-water mark."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93f3c1211a28ba3c9ab461fe7ff670b087e59be2/0_56_4496_2698/master/4496.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9ab64d5259769132ed0267969493b87","title":"eu priorities climate buzzwords critics","story":"Document setting out agenda for next five years denounced by environmental campaigners for skimping on detailA leaked document on the EU’s priorities has been criticised as offering little more than “a collection of buzzwords” to tackle the climate crisis and accelerating the destruction of the natural world.EU leaders are due to adopt a “strategic agenda” for 2019-24 at a Brussels summit starting on 20 June, but a draft has encountered a volley of criticism from some green groups, who accuse officials of lacking urgency.The document states that EU policies should be consistent with the Paris agreement, but spells out little detail about what that means.The campaign group WWF said the EU needed to hit net zero emissions 10 years sooner, in 2040. “Given the ecological emergency we are facing, climate action and nature loss must be prioritised in the coming mandate – but such promises are meaningless without fixed timelines for the EU to reach net zero emissions by 2040 and halt and reverse bioersity loss by 2030,” said Ester Asin, director of WWF’s European policy office.“The strategic agenda is critical in that it will help guide the next commission president,” she said. Asin added that the next European parliament – which will have a record number of Green MEPs – should vote only for a commission president who has “a clear work programme on climate action, environment and sustainability”.“European leaders are feeling the pressure to talk big on climate, but their strategic agenda is more of a collection of buzzwords than an emergency response to humanity’s greatest threat,” Greenpeace’s EU director, Jorgo Riss, said. “This list of contradictory proposals suggests European leaders will prioritise economic growth in much the same way as before, driving social inequalities and fuelling the climate and ecological crisis even further.”Other campaigners were more encouraged. Ariel Brunner, senior head of policy at BirdLife International, said the text covered most of the bases for a turn in a progressive direction. “This text, while still a bit vague, does suggest a real commitment to building a sustainable society, starting by addressing the twin crisis of climate breakdown and bioersity collapse” he said.“Now actions must follow, starting with setting up a new commission able and willing to address the crisis through strong legal proposals, strict enforcement of legislation, and bold reform of broken policies such as the CAP.”The text is likely to undergo further changes before it is presented to EU leaders at a Brussels summit next week. That gathering is scheduled to be the last one attended by Theresa May as prime minister, but the document gives no opening to discuss Brexit.Without mentioning the tortured process of the UK’s exit, it expresses hope for an EU trade policy that is “robust, ambitious and balanced” as well as “based on reciprocity and mutual benefits”.Elsewhere, the document sets goals that reflect longstanding British priorities within the EU, such as developing the single market in services.The text also seeks to boost the EU on the world stage, declaring that “the EU needs to be more assertive and more powerful” to defend its interests and values. To achieve these goals, it calls on EU member states to be more united in foreign policy and spend more on defence.On the issue of migration, the paper stresses control of external borders and calls on countries “to find a way through” long-running disputes on asylum policy – without suggesting how to break the deadlock."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/830e8b341b7d14276356ad6537cbc5f2c370b70d/254_0_4177_2508/master/4177.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bab8b5e06fce2ee002f8e5da331c4fda","title":"russian papers join forces in solidarity with detained journalist ivan golunov","story":"Comments come as Russia’s leading papers call for inquiry into case of Ivan Golunov The Kremlin has admitted mistakes may have been made by police during the arrest of Ivan Golunov, an investigative journalist, on controversial drug-dealing charges, as calls for his release grew louder.“Mistakes can never be ruled out,” said Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin’s spokesman. “The important thing is to recognise mistakes so that they aren’t repeated. Some issues need clarification.”Police initially published a number of photographs they said showed a drugs lab at Golunov’s rented flat in Moscow. They were later removed from the interior ministry’s website after police officials admitted the photographs had been taken at a different location and had no relation to the charges against the journalist. “A small mix-up occurred,” a police spokesperson said.The Kremlin rarely accepts Russian law enforcement agencies may have acted unprofessionally. Peskov’s comments came as Russian journalists and cultural figures put on an unprecedented display of solidarity over the charges against Golunov, which are being widely interpreted as an attempt to silence him and put a stop to his reports into corruption involving high-ranking officials.Three major Russian newspapers published almost identical front pages on Monday in support of the journalist, who was beaten in custody after being arrested in central Moscow on 6 June as he went to meet a source.Kommersant, RBK and Vedomosti, the country’s most respected papers, ran covers that read “IWe are Ivan Golunov”. They also published joint editorials calling for a transparent investigation into the allegations against Golunov, 36, who is under house arrest.All three of the papers have previously come under pressure from authorities and faced attempts to censor their reporting. Kommersant’s entire political desk resigned last month in solidarity with two veteran journalists who were dismissed after writing a story about a possible government shakeup.A spokesperson for Alisher Usmanov, the Kremlin-linked businessman who owns Kommersant, said he did not interfere in editorial policy.The Russian health ministry’s leading drugs specialist, Yevgeny Bryun, told state TV on Sunday that no traces of drugs had been found in a urine sample provided by Golunov.Pavel Chikov, the head of the lawyers’ association Agora, which represents Golunov, published results of tests the journalist has taken to prove his innocence. He said the tests indicated it was unlikely Golunov regularly handles drugs, as police have suggested.Even journalists employed by state-run media have been speaking out in defence of Golunov, with dozens signing an open letter calling for the charges against him to be dropped.NTV, a usually Kremlin-loyal TV channel that has carried out smear campaigns against opposition figures in the past, also expressed concern. “This is a test for all of us,” said the anchor Irada Zeynalova during a weekly news roundup. “It depends on us what kind of country this is.”Thousands of people have indicated on Facebook that they will attend a march on 12 June in Moscow in support of Golunov. The protest, which has not been approved by authorities, will pass by the FSB security agency headquarters and end outside the interior ministry.Protests have so far taken place across Russia, as well as at Russian embassies in Berlin, Kiev, London, Riga, Stockholm and Washington DC.Some of Russia’s best-known actors, celebrities and musicians have also expressed outrage. Time Machine, one of the country’s biggest rock bands, were pulled from the lineup of a televised concert due to take place in Red Square on 12 June – the Russia Day national holiday – after their vocalist, Andrei Makarevich, spoke out in support of the journalist.A spokesperson for the band said: “I think they were afraid Makarevich would say something about the Golunov case.”Ivan Kolpakov, the editor-in-chief of Meduza, where Golunov works, said the scale of the public outcry over his arrest was linked to the increasing willingness of many Russians to stand up for their rights.Protesters have rallied in recent weeks over a controversial landfill near Arkhangelsk and the construction of a church on green space in Ekaterinburg. “There is a general politicisation,” Kolpakov said.Golunov was beaten and kept in custody for 12 hours without a lawyer after he was stopped by police in Moscow on Thursday on suspicion of drug dealing. He was transferred to house arrest on Saturday.Friends and colleagues of Golunov’s vowed to keep up the pressure on the government.Sergey Smirnov, the editor of MediaZona, a news site that covers Russia’s courts and prisons, said: “It’s still early to talk about this case being closed.“The police yesterday suffered a real defeat in court because house arrest is clearly a victory for the defence. But now the police will do everything they can to prevent this case from collapsing.”Russian courts very rarely release suspects from custody in drug cases. Golunov could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted of drug possession with intent to sell.Galina Timchenko, the chief executive of Meduza, said: “This is not a victory. This is the first step toward liberating Ivan.” She thanked supporters for helping protect Golunov, saying his life would have been in danger in a detention centre.He has investigated state corruption and illicit business practices and was reporting on a scheme to corner the market in funeral services before his arrest. He had been receiving threats before he was taken into custody.Meanwhile, a court in Chechnya on Monday ordered the release on parole of Oyub Titiev, a human rights worker who was sentenced to four years in prison in March on drug possession charges. The court’s decision came as a major surprise. Titiev, who works for the Memorial human rights group, had accused Chechen police of planting marijuana in his car.Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3915683.1559746587!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"airports are designed to get our cash here s how they do it","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIs there any way to make it to your departure gate without walking through duty free?With all the queuing and the security and the stress and the delays and the tinny announcements that can barely be heard as they are mumbled over the public address system and the sometimes over-the-top restrictions on our civil liberties – restrictions that we would refuse to accept in the real world – it is easy to find reasons to give out about airports.But for all their faults we’d be lost without them.

File photograph: GettyMinister for Education Joe McHugh has pledged to tackle barriers preventing emigrant teachers returning home but has warned he does not have “any quick-fix ideas”.Mr McHugh is due to visit the United Arab Emirates this week to host a series of town hall-style meetings with teachers. The initiative is part of a drive to make it easier for them to return to Ireland.School management bodies say a shortage of teachers is causing a “crisis” due to a lack of substitute cover at primary level and qualified teachers in key subjects at second level.Speaking in advance of his visit, Mr McHugh said he wants to identify practical steps that could make it easier for teachers to return home.A key area he says he will examine is providing a mechanism to recognise teachers’ middle-management experience in schools abroad. Many emigrant teachers express frustration that, despite serving as heads of department, this experience is often not recognised here.“We have to look at the progression of teachers, what new skills, what experience they build up in terms of responsibility,” said Mr McHugh. “We have to open up a wider conversation over the roles of responsibility teachers have abroad and how we incorporate that into the system when they return home. I don’t have any quick-fix ideas around it . . . but those teachers bring experience, talent, insight and new perspectives.”Among the obstacles regularly cited by emigrant teachers include difficulties securing full-time posts at home, red-tape involving the Teaching Council as well as the cost of living.Online portalMr McHugh said a representative from the council will join him for the visit to take on board any ideas for streamlining registration or other issues. He said a new online portal, which opened last week, is an example of the kind of practical steps that would assist emigrant teachers.The portal – which operates under the title turasabhaile or “journey home” – will give teachers the opportunity to register their contact details, CVs, preferred employment location and specialist subjects.Mr McHugh, a former teacher who spent a year teaching in the UAE in the mid-1990s, said the visit also aimed to pay tribute to the contribution of Irish teachers abroad. He said teachers were magnificent ambassadors for the State and were boosting the country’s reputation wherever they go.There are an estimated 2,000 Irish-qualified teachers based in the UAE and hundreds have signed up for three meetings with the Minister in Abu Dhabi, El Ain and Dubai.When asked if the Government would consider additional pay for teachers based in the greater Dublin area – which faces some of the most acute shortages – Mr McHugh replied that the cost of living was also an issue for other professions.He is primarily concerned with looking at the kind of practical steps that can be taken in the short to medium term."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3921276.1560201274!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cabinet to consider new report on outsourcing of smear tests","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStephen Teap, whose wife Irene Teap died of  cervical cancer, Dr Gabriel Scally and Lorraine Walsh,  who received an incorrect smear test result, at the launch of the Scally report into the CervicalCheck screening programme in September 2018.   Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsA new report by Dr Gabriel Scally into the outsourcing of smear tests to Hawaii and Orlando in the US is expected to be considered by the Cabinet on Tuesday.It emerged last year that CervicalCheck and the HSE were unaware that a contracted US lab outsourced Irish smear tests for analysis to other US labs in Texas, Florida, Nevada and as far away as Hawaii.The issue emerged in a report for the Government into the CervicalCheck controversy last year by Dr Scally, a public health doctor.During a visit to CPL in Austin, Texas, Dr Scally’s scoping inquiry was “surprised” to learn that a “significant proportion of tests had in fact been undertaken in “a much smaller facility in San Antonio, Texas”.Stephen Teap, whose wife Irene died from cervical cancer, told RTÉ’s Ray D’Arcy programme on Monday that he hoped a report into the outsourcing would be published after the Cabinet meeting.Meanwhile, the Department of Health has said that women who have applied to a newly formed ex-gratia scheme should receive their first payments in the coming weeks.Under a new €5 million scheme, the 221 women affected by the CervicalCheck controversy or their next of kin can apply for a payment.SettlementThe level of payment has not yet been set, but is expected to be about €25,000 each, based on the settlement reached in a court case last year.The Department said 121 applications have been received.“We expect that for those cases where there was a clear lack of disclosure, an ex gratia payment – this amount to be determined very shortly by the independent expert group, chaired by Mr Justice Ó Caoimh – will issue within a few weeks.”Social Democrats co-leader Catherine Murphy is due to raise this in the Dáil on Tuesday after being contacted by families of women in the 221 group who have complained about being met “with a wall of silence” over the scheme.One family say they have had to email multiple times to get information on the scheme and when the payments may be made.Those affected say they have not received satisfactory replies from the designated email addresses they were given, and have been unable to find out when their applications will be processed."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3921238.1560197660!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"state faces 2 8bn in hse legal claims","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe cost of claims against the HSE and settled last year by the agency jumped 13 per cent to €318.7 million, from €283.2 million in 2017. File photograph: Getty  The State is facing a liability of almost €2.8 billion to fund future personal injury and property claims against the Health Service Executive.The figure, which grew almost 20 per cent last year, relates to active legal claims being handled by the State Claims Agency (SCA), which have yet to be concluded.Most of the €2.792 billion in liabilities on the agency’s books is accounted for by claims in respect of clinical care in the health service (€2.332 billion), with the rest relating to non-clinical care claims, according to the HSE’s annual report for 2018.The cost of claims against the HSE and settled last year by the agency jumped 13 per cent to €318.7 million, from €283.2 million in 2017. Such was the growth in claim settlements the SCA had to be provided with an additional €46 million as part of a supplementary budget last year.Actuarial estimatesThe annual claim cost figure is expected to increase significantly in future years, based on actuarial estimates, the report says, though no provision has been made for this liability in the financial statements.Catastrophic birth injuries account for the single most costly category of claims against the health service. Separately, controversy last year over the CervicalCheck screening programme has been followed by a big increase in litigation involving this and other screening programmes.Despite growing concern at the cost of litigation, two-thirds of claims received by the SCA had not been reported previously within the health service, according to the report.The accounts separately record an outstanding estimated liability of about €198 million arising from a deal reached between the State and medical consultants on historical pay issues. Forty per cent of the pay retrospectively due to consultants is being paid this year and the balance in 2020.Complaints officersHSE received 6,268 compliments while 6,610 complaints were recorded last year, the report states. The number of complaints is down on the 8,281 recorded in 2017 but this may relate to a change in the way they are handled only complaints made formally to complaints officers, rather than to frontline staff, are recorded.The main areas of patient complaint were “access”, “safe and effective care” and “communication and information”. Just over half of all complaints were dealt with in the requisite 30 days.A further 11,367 complaints were recorded and examined by staff in voluntary hospitals.The office of the confidential recipient, a service that deals with allegations of abuse or mistreatment in HSE or HSE-funded residential care facilities, dealt with 206 complaints last year, a slight increase on 2017.The HSE also received 48 protected disclosures from staff during the year.AccountsThe highest-paid inidual in the HSE was paid between €610,000 and €620,000 last year, the accounts show, while another member of staff was paid between €430,000 and €440,000.Some 392 staff were paid more than €200,000 last year, compared to 289 in 2017.Former HSE director general Tony O’Brien, who stood down in May 2018, was paid €238,207 last year, the accounts show. This was made up of basic salary payments of €139,649 and severance pay of €98,558.Anne O’Connor, who was appointed interim director general after Mr O’Brien left, was paid €112,468 for her work in this capacity during the year."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Catastrophic birth injuries account for most costly category of claims against the health serviceFirst payments to women affected

link free over 75s tv licences pension credit","story":"The BBC takes full responsibility for the over-75s scheme next yearArts and Entertainment EditorTheresa May has urged the BBC to rethink its plan to scrap free TV licences for most over-75s, as it announced that three million pensioners would no longer be eligible for the concession.The Prime Minister was “very disappointed” by the decision, a spokesperson said, after the BBC revealed eligibility for free licences will be means-tested from June next year, leaving them only available to those who qualify for pension credit.Around 1.5 million of the 4.45 million households currently receiving free licences will be eligible.The corporation said maintaining the universal scheme would cost £745 million a year and necessitate the closure of BBC Two, BBC Four, the BBC News channel, Radio 5 Live and BBC Scotland, plus local radio stations and other services. The new scheme will cost £250 million per year.The announcement triggered a major clash with the government, which passed responsibility for the scheme on to the BBC as part of a deal negotiated four years ago.The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: “We are very disappointed with this decision. We have been clear that we expected the BBC to continue this concession.“People across the country value television as a way to stay connected and we want the BBC to look again at ways to support older people.“Taxpayers want to see the BBC using its substantial licence fee income in an appropriate way to ensure it delivers for UK audiences, which includes showing restraint on salaries for senior staff.BBC licence in numbersLord Hall, the director-general, said it had “not been an easy decision” but the outcome is the fairest one. Writing in Tuesday\u0027s , he said a public consultation on the issue was evenly split between those who wanted to keep the universal licences and those who wanted change “but what emerged across all the feedback was the overriding concern to protect those most in need - and to protect the BBC and what it offers”.Age UK said many pensioners live in poverty but do not claim pension credit, either because they are unaware of it, are unable to navigate the complicated application process, or are simply too proud to accept benefits.Caroline Abrahams, the charity’s director, said means-testing would leave vulnerable elderly people cut off from the world.“Make no mistake, if this scheme goes ahead we are going to see sick and disabled people in their 80s and 90s who are completely dependent on their cherished TV for companionship and news, forced to give it up.“Means-testing may sound fair but in reality it means at least 650,000 of our poorest pensioners facing a big new annual bill they simply can\u0027t afford, because though eligible for pension credit they don\u0027t actually get it, she said.The BBC\u0027s decision will cause those affected enormous anxiety and distress, and some anger too, but in the end this is the Government\u0027s fault, not the BBC\u0027s, and it is open to a new prime minister to intervene and save the day for some of the most vulnerable older people in our society who will otherwise suffer a big blow to their pockets and to their quality of life.”A report commissioned by the BBC suggested that pensioners now enjoy “a marked improvement” in living standards since the scheme was brought in by the then chancellor Gordon Brown in 2000.TV Licensing said all over-75s will receive a letter over the course of the next month explaining the new scheme, and a ‘Pay as you Go’ scheme will be set up next year offering fortnightly or monthly payment plans for pensioners whose free licences are being revoked.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Other items include marble heads dating from ancient Rome, a painted wooden Egyptian coffin, and a bronze Egyptian cat statue.They hope to raise £4 million from the auction, and insist that it is being sold legitimately.“Ancient objects by their nature cannot be traced over millennia,” said a spokeswoman for Christie’s.“It is hugely important to establish recent ownership and legal right to sell which we have clearly done. We would not offer for sale any object where there was concern over ownership or export.”They say that the statue was acquired from Heinz Herzer, a Munich-based dealer, in 1985. Prior to that it was acquired by Joseph Messina, an Austrian dealer, in 1973-74. He obtained it from Prinz Wilhelm von Thurn und Taxis, who reputedly had it in his collection by the 1960s.The work has been widely exhibited and published and we have alerted the Egyptian Embassy so they are aware of the sale,” said Christie’s.“There is a long-standing and legitimate market for works of art of the ancient world, in which Christie’s has participated for generations. Christie’s strictly adheres to bilateral treaties and international laws with respect to cultural property and patrimony.But Egyptian officials have called on Christie’s to prove the statue left the country legally.“We will do our best to stop this auction immediately,” said Dr Mostafa Waziri, the head of Egypt’s supreme council for antiquities.“We will talk to the Egyptian foreign ministry and our ambassador in London to do our best to stop it, as we have to check.”Dr Zahi Hawass, former Egyptian minister of antiquities, said that the statue looks like it came from Karnak.He believes the statue left Egypt in 1970.“I don’t think Christie’s have the papers to show it left Egypt legally it’s impossible,” he said. “Christie’s has no evidence at all to prove that, and therefore it should be returned to Egypt.”Egypt introduced a law in 1983 to regulate the ownership of Egyptian antiquities, saying any ancient artefacts discovered in the country are considered state properties with the exception of antiquities whose ownership or possession was already established at the time this law came into effect.Dr Hawass believes that regardless of any laws, Egypt has an ethical right to recover the Tutankhamun bust.This piece was smuggled out of the country and Christie\u0027s cannot prove otherwise. It\u0027s totally Egypt\u0027s right, he said.Dr Shaaban Abdel-Gawad, the head of the anti-smuggling department at Egypt’s ministry of antiquities, said in a statement that officials were “studying the auction files in preparation for taking the necessary measures”.The ministry also reiterated Egyptian officials’ demand for documents showing proof of ownership.“If it is proven that any piece is illegally exported, all legal procedures are taken with Interpol, in coordination with the Egyptian ministry of foreign affairs in order to ensure its return,” said Dr Abdel-Gawad.“We will not tolerate or allow anyone to sell Egyptian influence at all.”New York helicopter crash: Pilot  killed in fiery accident on top of Manhattan skyscraperChoosing a nursery could be more important than school when it comes academic achievement, study findsMPs call for ban on sex harassment gagging orders in wake of Sir Philip Green allegationsHousing wealth of south east homeowners rises £80,000 more than rest of country, new study revealsParents put toddlers\u0026#39 mental health at risk by allowing them onto social media aged two, warns Barnardo\u0026#39sUK weather: Amber weather warning for rain issued in London and south eastPhotos of tourists entering US stolen in cyber attack, border agency saysFlight delayed after passenger opened emergency exit thinking it was a toilet doorScots face paying hundreds of pounds more to fund Boris Johnson plan for English income tax cutTory leadership election latest news: Michael Gove tries to deflect cocaine row with \u0026#39desperate\u0026#39 attack on Boris JohnsonUniversity entrance system could be overhauled so students onlyComment: Tory contenders should learn from Pitt the Younger to avoid becoming another Theresa MayComment: Only Boris Johnson as leader can address voters\u0026#39 anger by repairing trust and delivering BrexitJeremy Hunt accused of \u0026#39drawing a veil\u0026#39 over his breach of anti-money laundering lawsPolice say there\u0026#39s \u0026#39no guarantee\u0026#39 criminal charges will be brought over Grenfell Tower fireJeremy Hunt emerges as beneficiary of Michael Gove\u0026#39s cocaine misstep in battle with Boris for Tory leadershipGurkha families among 1,350 migrants illegally forced to provide DNA to support bids to live in UKLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan was never briefed on Hizbollah bomb factory plotConservative leadership race: Who are the Tory candidates hoping to become the next Prime Minister?Huawei compared to company that produced gas for Nazi death camps, as executive appears before MPsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/10/TELEMMGLPICT000000581552_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZ3JYT0DQVBTGs2S0kAkwrZUKnc9nygfLxH5rInUx4DA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"flight delayed passenger opened emergency exit thinking toilet","story":"The flight from Manchester was delayed for almost eight hours A flight from Manchester was delayed for almost eight hours when a confused passenger opened an emergency exit after mistaking it for the toilet door.The Pakistan International Airways (PIA) flight to Islamabad was almost ready for takeoff when the woman grasped for the wrong door, launching the emergency evacuation slide.The passenger reportedly told airline staff she thought the door was for the toilet.

Serial entrepreneur Renee Elliott\u0026nbspwas the woman\u0026nbspwho kickstarted the UK’s organic food scene back in the Nineties – way before kale made its way on to\u0026nbspthe menus of fashionable London restaurants.To Elliott, health is the foundation of a person’s wellbeing. “Taking care of yourself is key,” she tells The Independent.\u0026nbsp“For some women it’s a little uncomfortable, for others it can even be agonising, it depends on how you’re built. But I know that if I go out of balance then I go into stress.“In business, life or relationships it’s about trusting and respecting yourself and your body. Essentially trust your gut, not your brain.\u0026nbspIf it tells you to do it, you should respect that, whether it’s an important business decision or sleeping more.”Elliott is as passionate about this mantra today as she was in 1995 when she opened the UK’s first organic supermarket, Planet Organic – the company that was to change not just her career but also the way that organic retailing developed in the UK.Created with Sketch.Food and drink news Show all 35Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.135 Healthy living makes us more inclined to binge, research suggestsGluten-free breads, dairy-free milks and other plant-based products have been some of the most favoured foods in British supermarkets this year.235 Growing list of Vegan celebsMaking the switch to veganism is a major lifestyle choice, one that many claim can improve energy levels, lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and clear up any skin issues.

Cambridge PhD graduate-turned farmer, Adrian Izzard has used traditional growing techniques at Wild Country Organics to produce the colourful spuds, packed with healthy cell-protecting anthocyanin, which had previously disappeared from UK plates when post-war farmers were pushed towards higher-yielding varietiesOver the last 10 years, what began as\u0026nbspa shop on Westbourne Grove became a multi-million pound business.\u0026nbspPlanet Organic\u0026nbspraked in £30.6m\u0026nbspin sales last year on operating profit of £590,000 over seven stores. This year the firm is on track to book revenues of £36m.Although Elliott stepped down from her role as director in 2018 after Planet Organic was sold in a deal thought to be worth around £15m, she remains the brand spokesperson and kept\u0026nbspshares in the business.Her desire to help people lead healthier and happier lives prompted her to launch her second venture, Beluga Bean\u0026nbsp– an academy that\u0026nbspruns courses to empower women with business and life skills including how to save for your pension, deal with postpartum depression or find\u0026nbspthe right balance between your children and your business.Turning her aspirations from fantasy to reality was far from easy but\u0026nbspworking in the food industry was inevitable for Elliott.She was born in Pascagoula, Mississippi, in a home where her mother was always cooking.\u0026nbspHer father kept a large vegetable garden, which she helped out with. “It’s funny I didn’t really see this until I got older, but when I look back, food was always a big part of my family,” Elliott says.“My mum was an incredible cook and baker. Every holiday, every birthday, every graduation, it was all about the food.”As a student, Elliott went travelling in Europe and met her future husband on a night bus in London in 1985. After realising it was more than a summer fling, she settled in the UK\u0026nbspthe following year.Her eureka moment came when she stepped into an organic supermarket called Bread \u0026amp Circus – now a part of Whole Foods – on a visit to the US. Disheartened by the lack of organic presence in the UK, she decided to take matters into her own hands and bring\u0026nbspthe concept to London.“For a long time I had this theme running in my head about food not being what it should be and no one looking after my health in terms of what was available on supermarket shelves,” she explains.“America is usually ahead of the UK, so I thought nobody is doing this back home and I am going to recreate this.”At the time, Elliott was a writer for a wine magazine, so this\u0026nbspfirst step towards her professional goals started with a career U-turn.“I managed a health store for two years but other than that I had no prior business experience, I was an English major at university,” she says.“It was almost easier because I was naive. My dad once said, ‘There’s no reason you can’t do anything, anyone else can do,’ and I believed him.”It took her a year to write up the business plan, find the funding and come up with a logo before opening the first Planet Organic store on Westbourne Grove in November 1995.“Today I spend a lot of time telling my clients don’t worry about the ‘how’, paint the ‘what’ first,” she says.\u0026nbsp“A thousand little steps will lead you to success but if you start focusing on the ‘how’ from the beginning you will be paralysed.”By 1996, stories about mad cow disease,\u0026nbspBSE,\u0026nbsphit headlines in the UK and Elliott was poised to reap the rewards.The business doubled its turnover from\u0026nbsp£1.2m\u0026nbspto £2.4m,\u0026nbspso the founder knew she was heading in the right direction. “It was like chasing a galloping horse, it took up so fast we could barely keep up,” she adds.But just as business was booming, her business partner, who put in the initial equity investment, took her to court.“My business partner, who was a man from a privileged background, decided I should leave the business,” she says.\u0026nbsp“When I refused to abandon what I essentially saw as my baby, he took me to court. It was the hardest thing I ever faced, it was awful and it lasted 14 months.”To get through that period, Elliott practised self-care and read Sun Tzu’s The Art of War – an ancient Chinese military text – the core message of which is know your enemy.Eating organic food lowers risk of certain cancers, study suggestsCould co-operative shops be the answer to expensive organic foods?Pesticides cause brain damage and organic food is the future, says EUThe damage done by neonics makes the case of organic foodOrganic food healthier than farmed products, says new research“I slept, I stopped drinking and I meditated – essentially I prepared,” she says.\u0026nbsp“I was a very good student at school, so I prepared ferociously and I won.”After a decade\u0026nbsprunning the business, she felt like it was time to step down. “I had three kids, which I thought I’ll never do because the responsibility freaked me out,” she explains.\u0026nbsp“I knew\u0026nbspI would either have to hire a nanny or hire a CEO to run the business. It was an awful choice to make and I didn’t see it coming.“A girlfriend of mine told me, ‘Planet is more than 20 years old, it’s grown up now, it has your values,’ and that helped to step away.“But having children does slow you down. Women need to know, they need to have their eyes open, no matter how supportive your partner might be, we often end up being the caretakers. What you give your attention to ultimately thrives. And you can’t give your attention to everything, so often as women we have to make choices.”In 2017, she launched Beluga Bean to help other women learn from her experience of building a business from scratch, being an entrepreneur and a mother, and taking care of yourself.Courses include “Launch”, which\u0026nbspworks with business concepts,\u0026nbspand “Nourish”, which teaches baking and cooking to\u0026nbspimprove your health. Soon she\u0026nbspwill also be launching “Body Talk”\u0026nbspaimed at teenagers\u0026nbspstruggling with self-esteem and self-harming due to constant social media exposure.“We’re growing slowly but I have a big vision and I’ve committed to these for the next 10 years,” Elliott says.\u0026nbsp“The academy is 50 per cent business planning and it’s 50 per cent self discovery. So it covers everything and is meant to answer questions like, ‘I want to launch this business but I also want to have kids in five years’ to ‘I want to start my company but my partner is a bit unsure’ or help younger women to budget and save after they’ve graduated and are living on their own for the first time.”A sought-after speaker on nutrition and wellness, Elliott also teaches healthy baking at the College of Naturopathic Medicine in London and frequently lectures to budding entrepreneurs on podcasts such as Secret Leaders, which features interviews and tips from key figures within the UK tech and creative industries.“My motto in life is learn, earn, return and there’s a part of me that’s about giving back now and supporting others on this journey, because I’ve been there and done that.“These tools weren’t available when I started Planet, and it’s so nice to walk that journey with someone supporting you –\u0026nbspbecause it’s scary and you’re alone a lot of the time, self-esteem can be a problem.“When I launched Planet, my inspiration was The Body Shop founder Anita Roddick – but it’s not like there were many other examples of successful female entrepreneurs out there.”How does she balance it all? “Having fun every week and finding time for myself is key,” she says.\u0026nbsp“I dance and I walk every day.“That balance for me is critical. We often talk about destination but your goal point is always moving. This was my error with Planet – it was always about the next step. But you need to have fun and take care of yourself today because you don’t always know what the future will bring.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

When a recent UK Statistics Authority survey asked a representative sample of the public, 85 per cent\u0026nbspof people who expressed a view said they trusted the statistics produced by the ONS. Moreover, nearly three in four agreed they were produced without any political interference.\u0026nbspThis doesn’t stop some people on Twitter from expressing the view that our labour market figures are misleading or manipulated to support the government of the day.Here are some the most common misapprehensions I’ve spent a lot of time rebutting, in the hope we can persuade anyone who remains undecided on the veracity of our statistics to join the majority who trust our data.\u0026nbsp“The jobs figures are rigged by the government”\u0026nbspThe main numbers do not come from government data on jobs or benefits. Instead, they all come directly from the Labour Force Survey (LFS), a very large household survey carried out by the ONS right across the UK. That’s us, talking directly to real people in their tens of thousands, and logging information about their own experiences. I should also take this opportunity to say thank you to the thousands of people who take time to respond to our survey.\u0026nbspWe ask, among many other things, whether they are working, seeking work or not active in the labour market at all – in other words, we’re measuring their actual labour market behaviour.Ministers and their advisers have no influence on the ONS employment figures and no longer see the figures before they become public. We are independent of ministerial control and accountable, through the UK Statistics Authority, to parliament rather than the government.\u0026nbspThe claimant count is derived from benefits data provided by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). But\u0026nbspit’s compiled by ONS statisticians operating under a strict code of professional impartiality. It also ceased long ago to be part of the headline employment indicators –\u0026nbspthose are all drawn from the ONS survey.“Employment growth is driven by people working an hour a week or\u0026nbspon zero-hours contracts”Only a very small proportion of people in employment work very few hours – in January to March 2019 only 1.4 per cent of workers usually worked six hours a week or less. For many years this proportion has been falling, not rising, so is not a new thing. Likewise, only about 2.6 per cent of workers are in a zero-hours contract in their main job, and this proportion appears now to have peaked or to be falling.\u0026nbspYes, someone who only works for an hour a week is technically defined as employed because that’s the standard international definition of employment (more on that below). But the numbers of such people would seem to be vanishingly small.\u0026nbsp“The definition of employment and unemployment has been changed by the government to massage the figures so our figures aren’t comparable with those for other countries”The definitions used in the figures – what counts as employment and what as unemployment – are agreed internationally at the forum of the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The reason for this is, of course, precisely to ensure that different countries’ figures are comparable. These definitions are long-standing and haven’t been altered. Because they are set internationally, they are not subject to alteration by the UK government and there have been no changes at all to these definitions since the change of government in 2010.“The latest figures are not on the same basis as figures for the 1970s”Our employment and unemployment statistics go back to 1971 and we use the same ILO definitions throughout, so it is not true to say that our latest figures are not comparable with those for the 1970s. Our figures for the 1970s and 1980s are not the same as when those figures were originally published.Unemployment down again but Britain has a soft financial underbellyHow is UK unemployment so low despite Brexit turmoil?Universal basic income trial fails to help people back into workEmployers must do more to tackle domestic abuseEmployers not doing enough to keep new and expectant mothers safe That is because unemployment statistics used to be based on the number of people claiming unemployment-related benefits. However, we have used ILO definitions as our main indicator for over 20 years now because the previous method did not follow international standards and bred scepticism about the independence of the figures. Our unemployment figures have been based solely on the Labour Force Survey\u0026nbspsince the spring of 1992 when we started doing that survey on a continuous basis. The figures from 1971 up until the spring of 1992 are based on other surveys and indicators but use the same ILO definitions as the figures from spring 1992 onwards.“ONS includes unpaid family carers in the employment figures”This is an understandable mistake, but a mistake all the same. There is a small sub-category of employed people called “unpaid family workers” (though it only amounts to 131,000 people compared with 27.6 million employees and 4.9 million self-employed). That’s less than 0.5\u0026nbspper cent of all people in employment. However, it does not cover unpaid carers, who would not count in our employment figures if their caring responsibilities prevented them from being available for work. “Unpaid family workers” are actually people who work in a family business without receiving a formal wage or salary but benefit\u0026nbspfrom its profits instead.“Unemployment is a count of benefit claimants, and so ‘sanctioned’\u0026nbspclaimants and those not claiming benefits are excluded from the figures”That’s not the case at all – as I said, the unemployment figure comes from the ONS survey\u0026nbspnot the DWP, which manages the benefits system. The people who are counted as unemployed are those\u0026nbspaged 16 or over who are not working but are\u0026nbspboth looking for and are available for work, no matter what benefits they may or may not be receiving. So having one’s benefit claim sanctioned (stopped or reduced) does not directly affect this at all.“The school leaving age has been raised to 18, so 16- and 17-year-olds have been removed from the unemployment figures”The ONS does in fact measure unemployment among this age group. Our published figures show that in January to March 2019, there were 81,000 unemployed 16- and 17-year-olds, of whom 61,000 were still in full-time education. Of course, it is perfectly possible still to be in full-time education and count as unemployed – a student who was actively looking for a part-time job would meet the ILO definition and so would count in our numbers. Nor is it correct to say that the school leaving age has been raised to 18: while 17- to 18-year-olds are required to undertake some form of education or training, there is no requirement for them to remain at school. People in that age group can enter the labour market and some choose to do so.These, then, are the main misconceptions I’ve had to deal with. I suppose it’s understandable and only human to doubt figures when they don’t match your own experience. In addition, our statistics cannot capture every aspect of the labour market that is important to people. We’ve also been reporting record high employment levels at a time when according to other ONS figures the economy has not exactly been booming for everyone. Wage growth also has by historical standards been quite slow\u0026nbspand, adjusting for inflation, wages remain below their 2008 levels.\u0026nbspThe ONS survey is probably the biggest regular, long-running household survey in the UK. Its findings aren’t precise – there’s a degree of uncertainty in any sample survey, of course. But the ONS operates transparently and in the public interest. If anyone wants to know more about how the figures are compiled or what they say, we’re always happy to explain.\u0026nbspRichard Clegg is an employment statistician at the Office for National Statistics.\u0026nbspAfter 15 years as senior statistician presenting the UK’s monthly\u0026nbspemployment figures, he\u0026nbspis retiring from the ONSOffice for National Statistics\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The company hopes that they and many more to be launched in the future will power fast internet connections that will enable people around the world to get online.SpaceX had said that the objects would be bareful visible at all.But as soon as that launch was complete, people spotted the mysterious shiny objects flying through the night sky, as bright as the stars. Some even reported UFO sightings, fearful of what they thought they were seeing.Now the American Astronomical Society has together warned the world that the satellites could pose a considerable risk to people on the ground and in the sky. Such constellations could eventually outnumbers the number of visible stars in the sky, the astronomers said, with tens of thousands of the objects planned to be launched.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An image from Nasa\u0027s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) shows a 200,000 mile long solar filament ripping through the Sun\u0027s corona in September 2013230 Nasa Celebrates 50 Years of SpacewalkingFor 50 years, NASA has been suiting up for spacewalking.

The light being sent from the satellites as well as bouncing off them could stop astronomers seeing light from space, and the radiation coming out of them could get in the way of radio emissions.SpaceX launches first 60 satellites of its planned \u0027Starlink\u0027 projectWhat\u0027s more, the satellites are at risk of smashing into space-based observatories, which could cause chaos in near-Earth orbit.The group shared an image that showed how the trails formed by the satellites could ruin photos as they flew past.The society said it was excited by the possibility of new ways of connecting the world, and that it recognise that space was an increasingly important resource. But the world needs to do more to ensure that those using it don\u0027t pollute the night sky and harm astronomers and the general public.“The American Astronomical Society notes with concern the impending deployment of very large constellations of satellites into Earth orbit, it said in a new statement adopted during its most recent\u0026nbspmeeting.\u0026nbspThe number of such satellites is projected to grow into the tens of thousands over the next several years, creating the potential for substantial adverse impacts to ground- and space-based astronomy. These impacts could include significant disruption of optical and near-infrared observations by direct detection of satellites in reflected and emitted light contamination of radio astronomical observations by electromagnetic radiation in satellite communication bands and collision with space-based observatories.“The AAS recognizes that outer space is an increasingly available resource with many possible uses. However, the potential for multiple large satellite constellations to adversely affect both each other and the study of the cosmos is becoming increasingly apparent, both in low Earth orbit and beyond.“The AAS is actively working to assess the impacts on astronomy of large satellite constellations before their numbers rise further. Only with thorough and quantitative understanding can we properly assess the risks and identify appropriate mitigating actions. The AAS desires that this be a collaborative effort among its members, other scientific societies, and other space stakeholders including private companies. The AAS will support and facilitate the work by relevant parties to understand fully and minimize the impact of large satellite constellations on ground- and space-based astronomy.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Unhappy with the way the studio, New Line, had re-cut American History X, the filmmaker wrote multiple open letters – published by the trade press – telling people to not watch the final version. He even had the film pulled from Toronto Film Festival. “I had tried to get my name taken off it, and replaced with various pseudonyms,” Kaye wrote in , three years after the release. “One was ‘Humpty Dumpty’. Another was ‘Ralph Coates’, who played for Tottenham in the 1970s.” The Directors Guild of America would not allow Kaye to change his name, and he has bitterly lived with the accolade of directing the cult classic ever since.220 Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen – Michael BayThe first Transformers was a decent-enough popcorn flick. Critics may not have been enamoured by the CGI blockbuster, but there’s no denying watching robots beating each other up is mindless entertainment of the highest order. Yet, Michael Bay managed to make a mess of that simple winning formula in the sequel, Revenge of the Fallen, something he later admitted. When I look back at it, that was crap,” he said of the film in 2011. “The writers\u0027 strike was coming hard and fast. It was just terrible to do a movie where you\u0027ve got to have a story in three weeks. I was prepping a movie for months where I only had 14 pages of some idea of what the movie was. It\u0027s a BS way to make a movie.”While Swedish director Tomas Alfredson received acclaim for the Oscar-nominated Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, his follow-up film, the mystery thriller The Snowman, was ripped apart by critics. “Our shoot time in Norway was way too short,” he explained following the film’s release. “We didn’t get the whole story with us and when we started cutting we discovered that a lot was missing.” Alfredson added that, despite The Snowman being in development for years, with Martin Scorsese once attached as director, around 10 to 15 per cent of the script was not filmed. “It’s like when you’re making a big jigsaw puzzle and a few pieces are missing so you don’t see the whole picture,” he added.420 Avengers: Age of Ultron – Joss WhedonJoss Whedon changed cinema with The Avengers. The ensemble film brought a host of disparate superheroes together, and in the process made over $1.5 billion (£1.15 billion) at the box-office. Balancing all those characters was tough, and come the sequel, Age of Ultron, the director was worn down. Whedon apparently couldn’t muster the ability to watch the entire film after completion, saying: “I’m tied and I had a terrible time.” A year later, in 2016, the filmmaker clarified his comments. “I was so beaten down by the process. Some of that was conflicting with Marvel, which is inevitable. A lot of it was about my own work, and I was also exhausted.” Whedon added that he remains “proud” of the film, yet there are still things about the film that “frustrate” him hugely. Noah Baumbach is now a beloved indie filmmaker (thanks to The Squid and the Whale, Frances Ha, and The Meyerowitz Stories). Yet he was not always an acclaimed director. Baumbach despised his second film, Highball, so much that his directing credit was changed to Ernie Fusco and his writer’s one to Jesse Carter. “It was just too ambitious,” he said of the film, which concerns a newly married couple who end up inviting too many people to their Brooklyn flat for a party. “We didn\u0027t have enough time, we didn\u0027t finish it, it didn\u0027t look good, it was just a whole ... mess. We couldn\u0027t get it done, and I had a falling out with the producer. He abandoned it, and I had no money to finish it, to go back and maybe get two more days or something. Then later, it was put out on DVD without my approval.”Before Babylon AD – a futuristic sci-fi flick about a mercenary who has to escort a woman from Russia to America – reached cinemas in the UK, the director, Mathieu Kassovitz, was trying to distance himself from the Vin Diesel-led project. The movie is supposed to teach us that the education of our children will mean the future of our planet,” he said. “All the action scenes had a goal: they were supposed to be driven by either a metaphysical point of view or experience for the characters... instead parts of the movie are like a bad episode of 24. Kassovitz later added the film was pure violence and stupidity.In 1992, Dennis Hopper joined the ranks of directors who released their film under the pseudonym Alan Smithee (famously used when filmmakers disown their own film). Originally called Catchfire, the Jodie Foster-starring thriller about a woman who enters witness protection was later retitled Backtrack, and 20 minutes were cut for the straight-to-VHS release. Hopper rarely spoke about the film he wanted to distance himself as much as possible from the doomed project.“I think it’s a beautiful film to look at and I think the score is beautiful,” Steven Soderberg said of The Underneath, “but 15 seconds in I know we’re in trouble because of how f***ing long it takes to get through those opening credits. That’s just an indication of what’s wrong with this thing: it’s just totally sleepy.” The film, about a recovering gambling addict, was an unsurprising box-office flop. “I can’t say I’d recommend it to anyone,” Soderbergh added, “other than to look at in the context of someone’s career”.Alan Taylor – of Game of Thrones and Sopranos fame – seemed a perfect fit for Thor, the heroic God of Thunder who spoke in Shakespearean prose. When the sequel was released, many were disappointed with the film, which somehow wasted Christopher Eccleston, who played the villain. Taylor later criticised the project, saying: “The Marvel experience was particularly wrenching because I was sort of given absolute freedom while we were shooting, and then in post it turned into a different movie. So, that is something I hope never to repeat and don’t wish upon anybody else.”1120 Fear and Desire – Stanley KubrickFew filmmakers have spotless filmographies. Stanley Kubrick believed the blotch on his was Fear and Desire – the renowned-perfectionist’s cinematic debut. As his stature as a director grew, Kubrick was said to grow ever-more disgruntled with Fear and Desire, an anti-war film about four soldiers trapped behind enemy lines. Reports emerged in the Sixties that Kubrick had destroyed the original negative print, and was hoping to destroy all leftover prints. In 1964, Kubrick called the film “a serious effort, ineptly done”.1220 Batman and Robin – Joel SchumacherAlmost everyone involved with Batman \u0026amp Robin seems to hate the final product. George Clooney has apologised for his Bat-nippled version of the Caped Crusader, while director Joel Schumacher has said sorry multiple times. “Look, I apologise,” he said in 2017. “I want to apologise to every fan that was disappointed because I think I owe them that.” After the widely maligned film reached cinemas, Schumacher said he was treated like “scum”. “It was like I had murdered a baby,” he continued.1320 The Day the Clown Cried – Jerry LewisJerry Lewis’s The Day the Clown Cried has never been released. The director, who also starred as the leading character, locked the film – about a clown arrested in Nazi Germany for drunkenly defaming Hitler – in a private vault after completion. Lewis thought the film was so “bad, bad, bad” that he often refused to discuss the project, only commenting very occasionally. I was ashamed of the work and I was grateful I had the power to contain it all and never let anyone see it. It could have been wonderful but I slipped up – I didn\u0027t quite get it,” he said in 2013.Everything was looking good for Fantastic Four before filming began. Some of Hollywood’s most promising actors were playing the eponymous characters – Michael B Jordan, Miles Teller, Kate Mara and Jamie Bell – while Josh Trank, coming off the back of runaway success Chronicle, was hired to direct. During post-production, though, everything fell apart. Trank was forced by the studio, Fox, to do extensive reshoots (you can tell which scenes were reshot because Mara’s wig looks awful and Teller has varying lengths of stubble). The month before the film’s release, the director spoke out on Twitter. “A year ago I had a fantastic version of this,” he wrote. “And it would’ve received great reviews. You’ll probably never see it. That’s reality though.” The film bombed at the box office, with Trank’s tweet reportedly costing Fox between $5m and $10m (£3.8m and £7.6m).During the Nineties, Kiefer Sutherland wanted to progress from acting to directing. Although his feature-film debut as director, 1997’s Truth or Consequences, was not exactly a critical success, he persevered, directing the 2000 flick Woman Wanted. Sutherland was so disappointed with the results, he released the film under the pseudonym Alan Smithee – becoming the last person to ever use the famed name. He has not directed a film since.A film about the pseudonym Alan Smithee that ironically ended up being an Alan Smithee film. Arthur Hiller had no intention of disowning Burn Hollywood Burn, which aimed to lampoon the Hollywood system. The film centred on a director, named Alan Smithee (played by Eric Idle), who hands in a cut of a film, only for the studio to recut the entire thing. Life mirrored art as the studio behind Burn Hollywood Burn took the film away from Hiller, who ended up using the Smithee pseudonym on the release. Following the success of Oscar Best Picture winner The Elephant Man, David Lynch could have done almost anything. Despite having not read the book, Lynch agreed to adapt Dune, choosing the project over the third Star Wars, Return of the Jedi. Lynch soon started work on turning Frank Herbert’s epic novel into a screenplay, turning in over five drafts. Yet, despite the preparation time, the final results were less than satisfactory for the director. “I started selling out on Dune,” he said. “Looking back, it\u0027s no one\u0027s fault but my own. I probably shouldn\u0027t have done that picture, but I saw tons and tons of possibilities for things I loved, and this was the structure to do them in.”David Fincher was just 28 years old when the producers of Alien decided to bring the upstart on board their second sequel. With just five weeks’ preparation time, an unfinished script, and no real clout behind his name, Fincher struggled with the film. “Oh, it was just awful,” he later said. “This is the worst thing that ever happened to me.” In 2009, promoting The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Fincher elaborated: “I had to work on it for two years, got fired off it three times and I had to fight for every single thing. No one hated it more than me to this day, no one hates it more than me.”The fourth film in the horror series Hellraiser had a troubled production. Original director Kevin Yagher was ordered by the studio to reshoot scenes, which he refused to do. Joe Chappelle stepped in, leading to Yagher demanding the Alan Smithee pseudonym be used. The final film – which acted as both a prequel and a sequel to the other three films – was not screened for critics, and was dismissed by many fans.David O Russell began working on Nailed in 2008. Envisioning the film as a romantic comedy with political undertones, the director cast Jessica Biel and Jake Gyllenhaal in leading roles, and was awarded $26 million (£20 million) to make it. And still, somehow, the entire filming process was a mess. The set was shutdown a reported 14 times after cast and crew complained about not being paid. Eventually, after key scenes were not filmed during production, the entire thing was abandoned. After Russell started drawing Oscars attention for The Fighter and American Hustle, though, the studio wanted to get Nailed out in cinemas. Work continued on the film without Russell’s involvement. The film was then retitled Accidental Love and released in cinemas, with the director’s name changed to Stephen Greene. Critics hated the results. There are few directors who have gone so actively out of their way to discourage people from watching their film as Tony Kaye.

The film was then retitled Accidental Love and released in cinemas, with the director’s name changed to Stephen Greene. Critics hated the results. Since then, the film has suffered setbacks including director Danny Boyle quitting over reports of creative differences, which were rumoured to have something to do with Craig and producer Barbara Broccoli wanting to kill Bond at the end of the film. There\u0026nbsphave also been\u0026nbspa number of on-set incidents including Craig injuring his ankle in May, which halted filming for two weeks.Here\u0027s a timeline of everything that\u0027s gone wrong with\u0026nbspBond 25\u0026nbsp(so far).October 2015: Daniel Craig claims he would rather “slash my wrists” than play Bond again during promo for the latest film,\u0026nbspSpectre,\u0026nbspand that if he did another film, it would “only be for the money”.August 2017: After two years of speculation over whether he would reprise the role of Bond, Daniel Craig confirms that he will return as the British spy during an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. He said it would be his last outing as Bond and that he wanted to “go out on a high note”.August 2018: Danny Boyle leaves the project over “creative differences”\u0026nbspand disputes about the script, leaving the film in chaos and no way to meet the planned release date of autumn 2019. An unconfirmed report in The Sun claims that he quit over Broccoli and Craig\u0027s suggestion to kill 007 at the end of the movie, which Boyle allegedly thought was ridiculous.September 2018: Cary Fukunaga is announced as Boyle’s replacement.Health and safety bosses probe James Bond film set Explosion on set of Bond 25 injures one crew memberApril 2019: Launch event in Jamaica is disappointment for fans with the title still unconfirmed. The cast\u0026nbspappear decidedly muted, with Craig in particular seeming downcast.

Some 963 arrests have been made and 42 people charged in connection with the ongoing protestsThe BBC’s director-general, Tony Hall, said: “It would not be right simply to abolish all free licences.“Equally it would not be right to maintain it in perpetuity given the very profound impact that would have on many BBC services.“This decision is fairest for the poorest pensioners. It protects those most in need. And importantly, it is not the BBC making that judgement about poverty. It is the government who sets and controls that measure.“We also need to look at how the level of the licence fee is set in the future. The last two settlements have been made in the dark and without proper consultation.“It is vital that future decisions are evidence-based and made after proper consultation and scrutiny. We need to find a better way.”Funding the full free licence scheme would have cost the BBC some £750m\u0026nbspa year, or about\u0026nbspone-fifth of its budget,\u0026nbspthe corporation said.“We expect this would mean the closures of BBC Two, BBC Four, the BBC News channel, the BBC Scotland channel, Radio 5 Live, and a number of local radio stations, as well as other cuts and reductions,” it said in a statement.Special needs children discouraged from applying to schools amid cutsThe decision followed a consultation of 190,000 people.A government spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“We’re very disappointed with this decision – we’ve been clear that we want and expect the BBC to continue this concession.“People across the country value television as a way to stay connected, and we want the BBC to look at further ways to support older people.“Taxpayers want to see the BBC using its substantial licence fee income in an appropriate way to ensure it delivers for UK audiences, which includes showing restraint on salaries for senior staff.”Labour’s Tom Watson called on the Tories vying to succeed Theresa May as leader\u0026nbspto “honour the commitment they made in 2017”.“You cannot means test for social isolation. You cannot means test for loneliness,” the deputy opposition leader, and shadow culture secretary, added.Hannah Bardell, the SNP culture spokesperson, said the decision was “daylight robbery”. She tweeted: “Predicating the free TV licence on pension credit which has already been cut is a deeply damaging \u0026amp cynical act of betrayal.”Jan Shortt, general secretary of campaign group the National Pensioners Convention, warned that pension credit was “massively under-claimed”, meaning some of the poorest older people will wrongly miss out on free TV.A government report published in autumn last year estimated that up to 1.3 million families who were entitled to claim the benefit did not do so.TV Licensing, the body responsible for collection and enforcement of the television licence, said it will contact every customer currently in receipt of a free over-75s licence to explain what steps they would need to take next.It said everyone currently eligible for the scheme would remain covered by a free licence until 31 May 2020.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He remains a darling of the party\u0027s right wing, particularly those in the ERG, and is the most popular choice among Tory voters but his leadership bid would be fiercely opposed by many MPsEnvironment secretary Michael Gove is another member who has long wanted to be leader. He has lately been known for rousing his party in the commons, his recent speeches on the Brexit deal and Labour\u0027s no confidence motion have overshadowed the Prime Minister\u0027s. He has been loyal to the Prime Minister, partly to shed his reputation as a backstabber who abandoned Boris Johnson to stand against him in the 2016 leadership electionFormer Brexit secretary Dominic Raab has emerged as a favourite to be the Brexiteer candidate in a contest to succeed to Ms May. He displayed a grip on detail in his role as Brexit secretary. When asked recently if he would like to become prime minister he replied never say neverInternational development secretary Rory Stewart is pitching himself as the sensible candidate, promising to rule out both a second referendum and a no-deal Brexit. He was only recently promoted to the cabinet, previously serving as prisons minister, where he caught headlines with a pledge to resign if he could not reduce levels of violence within a yearThe former work and pensions secretary announced that she will be standing for the leadership when May leaves.

But that is just one theory on where it may have come from, and scientists stress that it is still unknown what the material is and where it might have come from.Imagine taking a pile of metal five times larger than the Big Island of Hawaii and burying it underground. That\u0027s roughly how much unexpected mass we detected, said Peter B James,\u0026nbspassistant professor of planetary geophysics in Baylor\u0027s College of Arts \u0026amp Sciences and lead author on a new study of the huge chunk.The crater that the mass sits on top of is over-shaped and 2,000 kilometers wide.

One of the explanations of this extra mass is that the metal from the asteroid that formed this crater is still embedded in the Moon\u0027s mantle.Scientists simulated a possible collision with an asteroid on a computer, and found that some kinds of metal could settle into the layer between the crust and the core, where this chunk is still sitting.We did the math and showed that a sufficiently dispersed core of the asteroid that made the impact could remain suspended in the Moon\u0027s mantle until the present day, rather than sinking to the Moon\u0027s core, Professor James said in a statement.If it is an asteroid impact, then it could be an unprecedented look at the kinds of collisions that were happening four billion years ago, when the crater was formed. Bigger impacts are thought to have happened through history – even on Earth – but they have been lost with time, and so the crater could be a way of looking back at a process that shaped our own planet and those that surround us.But the mass might also have formed with the Moon itself. It might be a build-up of dense gas that came about when the Moon formed into the large solid mass that we know today.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It\u0027s why we support a Final Say on BrexitAnd they challenged the invocation of wartime patriotism by the Leave camp, pointing out that it was Sir Winston Churchill who called for the creation of a “European family” to prevent another descent into bloodshed.Churchill’s words helped inspire the creation of the Common Market, which evolved into the European Union with “one main purpose - to create lasting peace by entwining our economies and societies together on a continent once ravaged by war,” they said.“Nato does not keep the peace in Europe – it keeps peace for Europe.

should be taken for granted.“We should be proud to lead in Europe, proud that our friends respect us and can rely on us.

Thirteen nations, including British, Irish, French and Dutch, also Belgians, Poles and Czechs - from all branches of the services - were part of that liberation coalition.“As Europeans, we were stronger together then and should be stronger together now.”He added: “What has happened since 2016 is very disturbing, and it’s clear that the military aspects of Brexit weren’t thought about properly.“Politicians trying to force us out of the EU without going back to the people are cowards, not leaders.

While there is a growing Stop Boris collective of Tory MPs, many in the party believe that he is the only candidate who could win a general election. He insists that Britain must leave the EU on October 31 with or without a deal.Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, was the first cabinet member to announce his bid just hours after the Prime Minister declared her departure date. He supported the Prime Minister\u0027s deal when she tried to get it through parliament and is pitching himself as the candidate to unite the Tory party.Andrea Leadsom, the former leader of the house of commons, is pitching herself as the party unity candidate. Speaking to Sky News as she announced her bid, Leadsom claimed to be a decisive and compassionate leader. She will prepare to leave without a deal but claims to have a three-point plan for Brexit which she will set out later in the race. Michael Gove, the environment secretary,  is leaning on his extensive government experience, having served in 3 cabinet roles since 2010, to make the case that he is suited to lead. His greatest challenge may prove to be convincing MPs and members to trust him as he earned a bad reputation for standing against Boris Johnson in the 2016 leadership contest after starting the race as Johnson\u0027s campaign manager.Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary, is the most direct opposition to frontrunner Boris Johnson similarly inclined to a hard Brexit but not as controversial among Tory MPs. He would seek a new, fairer deal, though he insists that Britain must leave the EU by October 31.

He has said that he will be the servant of parliament in delivering Brexit. Mark Harper, the former chief whip, acknowledges that he is the underdog in this race.

With concern mounting that the crowded field – which at one point reached 13 contenders – would mean a long and unwieldy election period, Committee officials last week announced a new format designed to cull no-hopers early in the process.Candidates now require the nominations of eight other MPs to stand, rather than the proposer and seconder demanded in previous contests.In a first ballot of Conservative MPs on 13 June, candidates with fewer than 17 votes will be eliminated.\u0026nbspIf all receive 17 or more votes, the least popular goes\u0026nbspout. If there is a tie for last place, officials will speak to the two candidates involved to see whether both should drop out or the ballot be re-run.A second ballot will be held on 18 June, with candidates needing 33 votes or more to survive. Again, if all pass the threshold, the one at the bottom of the list will be removed.By this point, the field should have been considerably narrowed, and further rounds of voting will take place on the following days in the hope of producing a final two by Thursday 20 JuneBetween each ballot, intensive horse-trading can be expected in Westminster as the surviving candidates seek to poach one another’s supporters and hoover up the backers of eliminated candidates.The final two contenders will go through to a postal ballot of an estimated 160,000 party members around the country in July, with the result currently expected in the week of 22 July.It emerged on Thursday that there is no guarantee the new leader’s name will be announced before parliament breaks up for its summer recess, potentially denying the opposition an opportunity to test whether he or she can command a majority in the House of Commons as prime minister.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A fleet of five vessels is\u0026nbspdue to embark on the first commercial whaling mission\u0026nbspon 1 July, the Japan Times reports.They plan to separately hunt for berardius whales (beaked whales) in Japanese waters off Minamiboso, close to Tokyo, for two months.

The figure is now closer to 5,000 tons according to government data. The industry reportedly employs around 1,000 people.New subspecies of pilot whale discovered thanks to 250-year-old theoryHow the ocean’s smartest animals continue to surprise scientists Hundreds of whales spotted in New York waters due to cleaner watersWhale freed from harness in Norway could be Russia-trained weaponGreenpeace Japan programme director Hisayo Takada, said: “Our oceans and their ecosystems are under threat from rising sea temperatures and acidification due to climate change, industrial fisheries and plastic pollution. Whales are also greatly affected by climate change, plastic pollution, oil exploration and by catch which is associated with industrial fishing. While these problems require time to be resolved, there are also threats that can be immediately removed, such as commercial whaling. Commercial whaling has been banned since 1986, by the International Whaling Commission that the Japanese government helped set up.“It is very disappointing that Japan continues to lose the trust of the international community due to their resumption of commercial whaling. Greenpeace urges the Japanese government to abide by international law and to continue its efforts to cooperate with the international community.” She added: “In order to protect all marine life from threats such as climate change and marine pollution, we need more than ever a strong global ocean treaty to help us establish and expand ocean sanctuaries around the globe to reach the international ambition of protecting 30 per cent of our oceans by 2030.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Outside of the States, the X-Men sequel made $140 million.The\u0026nbspprevious\u0026nbspworst opening for an X-Men film in the United States was\u0026nbspThe Wolverine, which took $53 million in 2013, closely followed by\u0026nbspX-Men: First Class, at\u0026nbsp$55 million in 2011.\u0026nbspDark Phoenix more closely matches Fantastic Four. Directed by Josh Trank, the superhero team-up was a flop, opening to $25.7 million in the US and losing 20th Century Fox an estimated $80 million.According to Deadline, Dark Phoenix\u0026nbspis expected to lose between $100 million to $120 million when all costs are added up. Fox fronted the bill for Dark Phoenix,\u0026nbspwith the film having been shot two summers ago – way before Disney purchased the studio.

Nazis enslaved Europe until a generation gave their all to wipe that evil creed from the earth. Nazis — real Nazis! — were waiting for those men and boys when they landed on those hellish beaches  years ago.As our Queen welcomed the democratically elected leader of the country that fought by our side in Normandy, Corbyn made a great show of boycotting Trump’s state banquet but attending the anti-Trump protest.And Corbyn never looked more like a -year-old student. The Americans are not simply our oldest allies, Jeremy, the Americans are our biggest trading partners. Who are we going to trade withyou ever get to  Downing Street  Venezuela  Palestine Jeremy Corbyn made a massive misjudgement by so flamboyantly snubbing Trump. And I suspect that somewhere in his mediocre old mind, Jezza knows it. That is why he later begged Trump for a meeting, which the President took great delight in denying.The Queen showed Corbyn how it should be done. Whatever Her Majesty’s personal feelings about this brash American President — and she seems to quite like him — she welcomed Trump with grace and dignity.The Queen’s treatment of her American guest was not simply good diplomacy. It was good manners. And the British care about good manners. To insult the American President as we honoured the American boys who never went home was, more than anything, just so unforgivably RUDE. Does Jeremy Corbyn know nothing of the British people Millions find it mind-boggling that he can happily break bread with Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA but refuses to share a state dinner with the President of the United States.Corbyn has spent so long in the self-loathing sewer of the hard Left that he has lost sight of a simple truth — most British people have a deep and profound love for this country.This week was a reminder that we have so much to be proud of. A nation looked at that dwindling band of brothers who stormed the beaches of Normandy and felt nothing but gratitude for their sacrice.There is an instinctive patriotism in our people that Corbyn and his Marxist muppets simply do not understand or share. Labour may have clung on to their seat in Peterborough by the skin of Corbyn’s dentures, but the virtue-signalling old booby never looked less like a potential Prime Minister.The oldest student in town does not look ready to form a government. He looks ready for a care home. The compulsive halo-polishing goes down a storm on social media, Mr Corbyn. It just doesn’t work in the real world.If the day ever comes when Corbyn is drooling on the doorstep of  Downing Street, is he only going to do business with people he approves of  How lonely he will be!GEORGE MICHAEL was the most generous of men. When we wrote his autobiography together, we innocently shook hands on splitting the profits -. But a ghost writer does not usually get the same payday as the global superstar with his name on the front cover.When we wrote our book, George was coming off the back of his first solo album, Faith, and was possibly the biggest star in the world. His American managers confidently assured my agent that our - deal was never going to happen. But it did – because George Michael insisted on it.He had given his word and we had shaken hands. George didn’t care about money. He cared about friendship.  So it was interesting to see how George’s last will and testimony ided his £.million fortune.Among those included are George’s -year-old dad, Kyriacos, his sisters Melanie and Yioda, and his friends Shirlie Kemp and David Austin. Those who didn’t make the cut included his lovers Kenny Goss and Fadi Fawaz, and his old Wham! buddy, Andrew Ridgeley.But Kenny and Fadi enjoyed the good le at George’s side for many years while Andrew has a joint songwriting credit on Careless Whisper, which has been worth around £million in royalties. Not bad, as Andrew was never particularly known for his songwriting genius.George probably felt he had taken good care of Kenny, Fadi and Andrew in le. George could be stubborn, self-destructive and self-obsessed. But he was a beautul man. And he had the biggest heart in the world.THEY are all queuing up to kick Anthony Joshua while he is down. Tyson Fury initially made sympathetic noises when Joshua got battered on his American debut by roly-poly Andy Ruiz Jr, a - underdog who resembles Homer Simpson’s body double.But now the Gypsy King has joined the sadistic joy in Joshua’s humiliation and recommends AJ, “never shows his face in public again”. Madison Square Garden was a catastrophe for Joshua.He was beaten up by a chubby chops who was such a late booking that his name did not even appear on the tickets.  But Ruiz was always more than a Snickers addict. Before Joshua, he had fought  times and only lost once. Ruiz was never going to be a walkover for Joshua.But AJ should have found a way to beat him.

She had been trying to die for a long time. Euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal in the Netherlands.Noa asked the Levenseinde end-of-le clinic in The Hague two years agoshe could be considered for euthanasia or assisted suicide but they — rightly — refused.She told De Gelderlander newspaper in December: “They consider that I am too young to die. They think I should finish my trauma treatment and that my brain must first be fully grown.That lasts until your st birthday. It’s broken me, because I can’t wait that long.” No one, surely, could read those words without agreeing that yes, she was too young to die. Right Most of us have enough le experience to know that, no matter how bad things are, or seem to be, dark clouds can hang around — but they do sht.Things change. Hopelessness gives way to hope. And dark often eventually becomes light. But Noa didn’t believe it.There is no doubt at all that her young le had been incredibly dficult. She’d had extensive treatment for depression and anorexia, and had tried to kill herself several times.She had been sexually assaulted at the age of  and raped at . She was so traumatised she didn’t want to live any more and, after repeated hospital stays, decided to stop treatment earlier this year.In what she referred to as a “sorrowful last post” on Instagram, Noa said she had “stopped eating and drinking for a while now, and after many discussions and evaluations, it has been decided to let me go, because my suffering is unbearable”.A hospital bed was set up in her parents’ home and last week she refused all food and fluids after her parents and doctors reportedly agreed not to force-feed her.It is pretty much impossible for most of us to understand quite how desperate, resigned, despairing this woman’s parents must have been to have facilitated their daughter’s voluntary death.They must all have felt sure that there was no alternative. But it’s also hard to resist the urge to challenge that notion.There are so many examples of people — from Maya Angelou to Malala Yousafzai to JK Rowling — who have overcome adversity to make a huge success of their lives.I know many people who have overcome very dficult, challenging and dark times as teenagers who have gone on to create fulfilling and happy relationships and live rewarding and successful lives.I think it’s fair to say that, as a teenager, it’s impossible to imagine the future. It’s all too easy to be so mired in the dficulties of the present that you feel you will be stuck there for ever.Without in any way diminishing Noa’s suffering, I do know there were things that felt to me like a crisis at  that I barely now recall.I would take the view that it’s possible to get over even the most dficult challenges — evenit involves temporary defeat, sometimes total failure, it is how you react that sets your path.The big question that this story raises is, should we be allowed to choose to die  Ultimately, I think the answer to that is yes, we should. But does anyone know enough about living at the age of  to choose to die  I don’t think so.IT IS striking that this week a new Lancet study confirmed what many of us already know: Self-harm among young women and girls is rising at an “alarming” rate.What on earth is happening to our young people  Our young women in particular. What is the cause of this epidemic of self-loathing, self-harm, self-destruction When I was a teenager I had problems, sure, but nothing that would have driven me to harm myself.But so many parents now have to deal with their children hurting themselves as a daily reality – and my heart goes out to them. I don’t have the solution. But I do have a few theories about how to help kids thrive.Sport is really, really good for kids. It builds self-esteem and gives them another focus than themselves, their bodies, and whether they measure up to the people they follow on Instagram.Social media can be a force for good. But it can make young people feel really bad too. Help your kids to find other outlets, hobbies and passions.Talk to your kids about everything. And listen. Be un-shockable. My daughter – for better or worse! – still tells me everything. No subjects are taboo and they never have been or will be.If you accept your child for who they are, you will help them to be their authentic selves, rather than trying to be someone they are not. That is one of the greatest gts you can give them.I CONFESS to a tear in my eye watching the moment when Nicolas Mahut’s son rushed on court to console his father about losing to Leonardo Mayer at the French Open.Their hug was so heartfelt, and incredibly sweet and touching.It was a great reminder that relationships matter so much more than winning ever will.DID you hear the one about the woman who sold her husband’s £, football memorabilia for a fiver after seeing him cheating Shelly Cohen, , from Warrington, Cheshire, was sick of husband Paul putting his love of the beautul game before their relationship.When a friend texted her to say she’d seen her husband at a Manchester City match with another woman, that was it.She gathered together his prized memorabilia collection, which dates back  years, and listed it for sale on her husband’s OnBuy account.Then she flogged his £, memorabilia collection for a fiver. All I can say is: OUCH!SEEING all the state banquets this week has reminded me about my own visits to Buckingham Palace.I’ve been to white-tie events there as well as an intimate lunch with the Queen.I’ve also had dinner at Winfield House, which belongs to the American ambassador, in the same room that Trump had dinner.And they really are momentous occasions. I mean, just getting ready is fairly momentous.Although for most of them, despite the best-laid plans, I ended up rushing home from work and throwing something on.Some things I remember, in no particular order – after dinner, I really wanted to go to the toilet. But no one is allowed to leave until the Queen does, so I had to just hold on, and on, and on.I practised my curtsey before I went. That’s because when I was given my CBE by Prince William I was given so many instructions about how many steps to take to the left, right, and backwards that when the time came to curtsey I ended up doing a SQUAT!So I thought a YouTube tutorial might be a good idea. When our last course arrived – a plate with a bowl plus a cloth – I didn’t know what it was.Luckily, I was sitting next to the delightful Lord Chamberlain, Earl William Peel, who told me that the bowl was to wash fruit and the cloth was to dry it.Lastly, the Queen really is the world’s most professional conversationalist.She knew about the Olympic Stadium and football, and talked about both of them as though she was really interested.Despite all the pomp and ceremony, I was made to feel absolutely comfortable. But I definitely had more than a moment of thinking, “Pinch me, I’m at Buckingham Palace!”There is no doubt that Donald Trump’s trip was a great success. But my main take home from everything I saw was, what I wouldn’t give to have Melania’s wardrobe! Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The search has now ceased, and sadly, the guest has not been found.Our thoughts and prayers are with the iniduals family during this dficult time.”Hundreds of passengers lined the decks to help the frantic search for the woman who reportedly couldnt swim as the ship turned back near Menorca.Claire Murphy, from Tonbridge, Kent who was on the ship for the week long cruise, told the Sun Online: They said they were turning round, because someone in pink pyjamas had been seen going overboard, so we had to go back and look for her.Everyone was bewildered and looking out of the windows or on the edge of the ship.It took us two hours to get back to the place where they were last seen. We stopped there for four hours to try and find her.We were literally in the middle of the Med, it was really windy and it was very rocky.Dr Kyjuan Brown, from Bermuda, told the Sun Online the female passenger had last been seen on her balcony at am wearing pink pyjamas.He said: The balcony of the ship was lined by passengers looking overboard for the missing girl.Around pm the search was called off and the captain informed us that according to the family she could not swim at all. Given the conditions its unlikely she would have survived.Everyone felt for the family. Its horrible to go on vacation and leave without a family member.The search meant that the passengers stop to Majorca was cancelled and the ship instead ed to Barcelona.Brit passenger Angela Elliott, , from Nottingham, added: The ship travelled back to the spot where she was last seen and it continued to search that area going up and down until .pm and it was too dark to continue.The ship then started its course to Barcelona. They did everything they could.There were maybe a couple of hundred passengers looking for a while. I think in the end, most passengers sadly realised that there would not be much hope of her being found alive after all that time in the water.A previous announcement over the tannoy of the ship had advised that she was not a strong swimmer.Noah Kowaloff told the Sun Online: There was an announcement asking for our help looking off the sides of the ship for pink pyjamas in the water. Many people were looking from the top deck.We circled the same area of the Mediterranean. Its still hard to believe it happened.Alexa March, who was on the ship, tweeted: The staff and local authorities did everything they could in search efforts.

We need the art of tough negotiation, not the art of empty rhetoric.But he warned that not delivering Brexit and being squeezed by the Lib Dems and the Brexit Party would allow Labour through the middle and for Jeremy Corbyn to come into No.Mr Hunt promised his social mission would be education - vowing to abolish illiteracy and ensure no one leaves school without a proper qualication to earn the average salary.Choose me and I will take us through this time of crisis, deliver Brexit, and get us back to walking tall in the world, he said.And Mr Hunt got two huge boosts when Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt and Tory kingmaker Amber Rudd threw their weight behind him to be leader.Ms Mordaunt, who some speculated could run for the leadership herself, said at Mr Hunts speech today: I trust him on Brexit because Ive seen him in Cabinet in the last year...

Wants a time limit to the backstop, will set up a council to stop a hard border in Northern Ireland, and would give £billion of funding to support it, using new technologies and trusted trade schemes.Tax: Wants to slash business rates taxes for small retailers and hit Amazon and other big firms with a new levy.Esther McVey released her campaign video today promising to stand up for Britains workers and pump more money into police and schools.She also labelled Mr Gove a hypocrite for slamming middle-class earners taking coke after doing it himself.Despite being a relative outsider she appeared to have got the needed eight backers as she said earlier her nomination papers were in.Brexit: Promises to leave without a deal on October  and says Mrs Mays agreement is dead.Tax: Has said she wants to cut taxes but hasnt said which ones.June : Theresa May stands down as party leader but will continue as PM until her successor is electedJune : Nominations for the leadership open am-pm candidates must have the support of eight MPsJune : First ballot of MPs, open am-pm any candidate with fewer than  votes eliminatedJune : Second ballot , open pm-pm any candidate with fewer than  votes eliminatedJune : Third ballot , open pm-pm candidate with fewest votes eliminatedJune : Fourth ballot , open am-pm candidate with fewest votes eliminated - any further ballots needed will also take place on this dayJune : Second stage begins where votes sht from MPs to party activists who will choose between final two candidatesJuly : Result announced this week, in time for Commons recess to beginMPs need eight backers to get nominated and hand in their forms.The first round of voting will take place on Thursday.In the next round MPs will need the support of  of their colleagues, and  in the one after.Several candidates are already struggling to get the numbers needed.Sajid Javid, Rory Stewart, Andrew Leadsom and Mark Harper are also in the running.Today Sam Gyimah dropped out of the race citing a lack of support.I have decided to step back, he revealed this evening just after the pm nominations deadline.James Cleverly and Kit Malthouse have already dropped out due to a lack of support."},{"url":null,"title":"mysterious bullet plane media california","story":"The Celera L is a bullet-shaped pusher-propeller plane by Calornian company Otto Aviation, which was first spotted on a US runway in May .Now, according to The Drive, the aircraft has resurfaced and has been seen doing high-speed taxi tests on the runway in preparation for its first flight.Several images of the bullet-shaped plane were posted on Instagram by user scttness, who called it an experimental pusher prop plane.The production of the bullet-shaped aircraft has been shrouded in secrecy while being tested at the Southern Calornia Logistics Airport near Victorville in the US.Until now, there have only been low-res phone images of the aircraft and experts were forced to speculate with few details on its potential uses.Some believed it could be a super-efficient private plane, a prototype for an electric aeroplane or even a film prop.Reasons for its production are still unclear, but we know that the aircraft is smaller than normal and obviously designed for efficiency.Official documents and lease agreements for the huge warehouse in which to test the plane were acquired by The Verge, and describe the potential purpose of the mysterious plane.One document said: “Preferably, it would have operating costs well below current costs and competitive with commercial airliners, cruise at higher system speed than current commercial aircraft...Have a longer range with full passenger and luggage load than most current business aircraft, provide passenger comfort comparable to commercial aircraft, and be capable of all weather operation.“The plane should also provide for ease of maintenance and require only a single pilot.The small plane will reportedly cruise at speeds of between -mph at an altitude of ,ft.According to the documents it could also provide up to  jobs for people working in the airport.As the plane has reportedly now been approved to fly, more information on its purpose should soon surface.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This is it.”When she was born in , the Ukrainian authorities sought to hide the “embarrassment” of her arrival to a family of Chernobyl workers living illegally in the -mile exclusion zone.Her parents refused to leave the zone because the authorities offered them no alternative housing.But they were harassed and accused of “murdering” their daughter.She swam in a river where fish - which her father Mikhail caught to feed the family - sent Geiger counters bleeping wildly, says the newspaper.She drank milk from a cow fed on Chernobyl pastures irradiated by the nuclear explosion.Her mother Lydia Sovenko was forced to deny rumours over her daughter’s health.If people think she is a mutant, or has two heads, they are quite wrong,” she said in one interview.She is a lovely child who is absolutely healthy as far as we can see.”Today Mariyka does not wish to highlight her past as she funds her studies working at a fashionable bar.She really doesnt care about being unique through being born in Chernobyl, said a friend.In fact, knowing that she is the only child who was born here after the explosion, and who grew up in Chernobyl, is rather painful for her.“She sees it as a stigma.Her health and success - confirmed by her mother and friends - comes as the nature of Chernobyl is fighting back against the appalling nuclear decimation it suffered  years ago.Wildle is teeming in the area with elk, deer, wild boar and wolves thriving as well as rare wild birds and flowers, some of them from the Red Book.As her mother, now , has said: People here believe that Mariyka is a symbol of Chernobyls renaissance, a sign from God which they interpret as a blessing to live here, and that le is coming back to this blighted place.”An alarm bellowed out at the nuclear plant on April , , as workers looked on in horror at the control  signalling a major meltdown in the number four reactor.The safety switches had been switched off in the early hours to test the turbine but the reactor overheated and generated a blast the equivalent of  nuclear bombs.The reactors roof was blown off and a plume of radioactive material was blasted into the atmosphere.As air was sucked into the shattered reactor, it ignited flammable carbon monoxide gas causing a fire which burned for nine days.The catastrophe released at least  times more radiation than the atom bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima.Soviet authorities waited  hours before evacuating the nearby town of Pripyat -

but warned him not to buy anything.The self-employed joiner, from Stockport, said he was horried when he woke up on Sunday morning to find his bank account had been raided.When he investigated, Murad noticed his hard-earned money had been collected by Sony PlayStation.He says his nephew was responsible for up to  separate transactions.Murads bank statement documents a series of payments ranging from £. to £..He says that despite desperate pleas to Sony and his bank, hes been told he cant be refunded.Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, Murad said: I woke up on Sunday and looked at my bank account.I am saving for a house and needed to move a few bills around and noticed there was £, missing.I looked into it and it said Sony PlayStation on my internet banking. There had been ten to  transactions all on the same day.It said it was for the game Fortnite, which I know my nephew plays, but he is six and so does not have a clue about money.He added: I told him not to buy anything, but he obviously got excited.That money was for a house I had been saving up for.Now Im absolutely skint.Murad said that when he rang his bank, staff said they had tried to make contact to warn him of unusual activity on his account.He said: Its so much money to go in one day, its just ridiculous.Thats four months of savings gone in one day.But Sony allows parents to create special child accounts that can be linked to your adult account.This lets you set a monthly spending limit, which is set to zero as standard.You can also set it higher, and then your children will be able to spend a limited amount of money each month.First, log into your main PS adult account.Then go to Settings gt Parental Controls gt Family Management.Choose Add Family Member gt Create User, and then enter your kids name and date of birth.Youll have to accept a user agreement, and then youll be given options to set specic parental controls.Xbox - Usually, the easiest way to avoid surprise Microsoft bills is by creating a special Xbox account with no payment details added.But playing Xbox multiplayer gamesrequires Xbox Live Gold Membership, which costs money.So that wont work in this case.However, you can create a special passcode thats required to very purchases.Just go Settings gt All Settings gt Accounts gt Sign-inThen choose Change My Sign-In  Security Preferences, and scroll right to Customise.Then scroll right again and select Ask For My Passkey To Make Purchases, and choose Passkey Required.Now all you have to do is pick a PIN number that your kids wont guess – so dont go with ,  or a birthday.Computer - Go into the account settings and then choose Payments.Once youre in there, simply make sure there arent any card details or linked PayPal accounts.If there are, you can very easily remove them.iPhone - Whenever you make a purchase on iPhone , youll always have to very it.Thatll be either by entering a password, using the Touch ID fingerprint scanner, or by scanning your face with Face ID.If your child doesnt know your password and isnt set up on any of these systems, youre largely safe.An email from Sony read: The transactions in question were made on a console with a dferent serial number from the one provided by you, but our investigations do not indicate that the account has been compromised as a result of internet fraud.The transactions are not eligible for a refund under the criteria outlined in the PlayStation Store cancellation policy and therefore we cannot offer a refund in this case.We do require the SEN account holder to be responsible for all activity on their account.Murad added: Sony is one of the biggest electrical companies in the world and they wont help me.Fortnite  - a game involving a hunt for weapons to kill rivals - is free but kids rack up bills on parents’ credit cards for arms upgrades and new outfits for their characters.US software firm Epic Games has so far raked in over £million from it.Many parents say their kids are hooked on the game, which has million users and three million playing at any one time.In April mum Vicky Winstanley told This Morning how her son Nathan was rushed to hospital with seizures after becoming addicted to Fortnite.She said he started having trouble staying awake and struggled with memory loss before she found him passed out on his bed.Medics said he was suffering from chronic fatigue after he spent hours playing the immersive game.Gaming addiction was classied as a medical disorder in June , meaning kids hooked on games such as Fortnite will now be able to access treatment on the NHS.The World Health Organisation told governments around the world they would be expected to incorporate gaming disorder into their health systems, after increasing evidence the addiction caused sufferers and their families severe psychological distress."},{"url":null,"title":"iran missile defence us tension persian gulf","story":"Defence minister Amir Hatami introduced the home-built surface-to-air weapon - dubbed the Khordad  - at a ceremony on Sunday.Thereports that the massive contraption is equipped with long-range missiles that can simultaneously track and destroy six dferent targets at once within a range of  miles.At the weapons unveiling ceremony, Hatami said: Iran will increase its military capabilities to protect its national security and interests, and it will not ask permission from anyone on this matter.The new weapon has been rolled out among growing tensions with the US, who recently escalated tensions between the two countries further by deploying aircraft into the Persian Gulf.On Saturday, a group of US navy fighter jets flew over the Arabian Sea for the second time, signalling to Iran Americas global military reach.Aircraft carriers were also deployed into the region on May  in response to troubling and escalatory indications of threats from Iran.The move was designed to send a clear message that any attack on the US will be met with unrelenting force.Iran had apparently threatened to target US troops in neighbouring countries such as Iraq and Syria, but the US move heightened tensions signicantly.Officials in Tehran, Irans capital, have repeatedly said that they would retaliate against US forces in the regionthey attacked.In recent years, Iran has been pushing to build its own weapons and become less dependant on foreign suppliers.The country is clearly keen to showcase its strength - even as it becomes increasingly more isolated and edges towards financial ruin.Last year, the US withdrew from the Irans  nuclear deal and compelled its European allies to stop importing Iranian oil - tanking the countrys economy.Hours before Iran unveiled its new weapon, it was urging European countries like France and Germany to uphold the commitments made under the nuclear deal.Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zar said Europeans have a duty to ensure that Iran s to an economically stable position.On Friday, Iran rejected a suggestion by France to re-open nuclear talks, after much back and forth between the two countries.The new weapon has apparently already been deployed to the countrys military.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Over  mins to get there for nothing.

More planning and more space is required we understand this . This was a free event and we plan to keep it that way .The decision was made on the day to park cars on the embankment site as the pay and display car park was full and traffic was backing up .

The leadership contenders’ initiatives are little more than wishful thinking.Above all, the expensive promises are just a gigantic distraction from the real task ahead: the delivery of Brexit. That is what really matters. Everything  is an irrelevance.The Tories’ entire future depends on the achievement of British independence. If that goal is reached, there is a chance of recovery, especially against the ided, ineptly-led Labour party.Butthe Tories fail to implement Brexit, they will be annihilated at the next General Election, a truth reinforced by the Peterborough by-election last week, when the Tories, in territory they have traditionally held since , were squeezed into a distant third place by Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party.Yet the leadership candidates continue dishing out their frivolous commitments like confetti. Here are just some of the ill-conceived promises made on the campaign trail so far...Cocaine enthusiast Michael Gove says he will abolish VAT and replace it with a sales tax.The move could be ruinously expensive for the Government, for VAT brings in almost £ billion-a-year. Most other countries in the world have a form of VAT.As Paul Johnson of the Institute of Fiscal Studies puts it, Gove’s proposal would be “the biggest, riskiest, and most disruptive change in the tax system in at least half a century.”The front runner Boris Johnson caused enormous controversy – and damage to himself – with his plan to cut tax for high earners by raising the  per cent threshold from £,-a-year to £,-a-year.His scheme would not only be cripplingly expensive to the Treasury, costing at least £. billion-a-year, but also is unlikely to win over less well-off voters, who should be the Tories’ prime target.According to one study yesterday, fewer than one in ten workers in the West Midlands would be winners.It might be noted, however, that MPs would be big gainers, for their £, salary is just below Boris’s proposed new threshold.Usually clear and rational, even Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has been infected with the madness of the leadership contest.Is he seriously suggesting we might go to war with either of them, despite all the lessons of our failed military interventions over the last two decades.And every one per cent increase in the proportion of national income spent on defence will cost the taxpayer at least £ billion.Esther McVey likes to pose as a tough northerner, but she is a soppy left-winger when it comes to schools.Sounding like a typical Labour MP, she bleated last week about “severe under-funding in schools” and said that “it’s time we started listening to the teaching unions,” as she promised an extra £ billion-a-year.But the unions are they last people we should listen to on education.Addicted to serial whingeing, they have opposed every single sensible reform over recent years, while they have invented the so-called funding crisis for their own political ends.Joining in the prodigality, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has pledged both an extra £. billion for the social care system and a new insurance scheme to end the supposed “injustice” of homes sold to meet care costs.But is this really a scandal  Why should ordinary taxpayers have to fork out to protect the inheritances of the affluent Home Secretary Sajid Javid promises a whopping £ million to Ireland as a “grand gesture” to solve the Brexit border problem, for which he has also advocated the use of new technology.But his proposal is both expensive and unworkable. As one Government official points out, “No Government worldwide currently controls dferent customs arrangements with no physical infrastructure at the border.”Ex-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, who sees himself as a Thatcherite, calls for slashing tax cuts for the low-paid, by raising the threshold at which employee national insurance contributions start from £ to £,, an average saving of £-a-year.He also proposes a penny off income tax for everyone, part of his drive ultimately to lower the basic rate from p to p. But such steps would signicantly shrink the tax base, as well as cost the Government as much as £ billion-a-year.Given that these candidates aspire to run the country, the leadership contest has been a depressing spectacle so far. Its excesses reflect the Tory party’s flight from serious statesmanship.Matt Hancock describes the contest as a “great festival of ideas.”It is more like a carnival of amateur illusionists desperately hoping their tired tricks will distract us from the Tories failure to deliver Brexit.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

be so easily manipulated.Neither was my mood, nor the show, improved by any of the other early arrivals, though.Especially not with Yewande, who was “working on cancer vaccines”  until she decided sunbathing on ITV was a better option.Sher, who claimed: “I dare to do what others don’t,” but hasn’t dared move out of his mum’s house yet.And brooding sandwich operative Joe, who spoke from a wide range of experiences when he said: “You can never go wrong with pulled pork.”There’s also boxer Tommy Fury and AJ Pritchard’s brother Curtis, who seems a good bet to share the £, prize, so long as he continues to be besotted by flight attendant Amy, by far the nicest contestant.If the series was to be summed up by a word instead of a phrase, though, it’d be underwhelming.A couple of lust triangles have developed around Lucie, but so little has actually happened that commentator Iain Stirling has been turning all the same stationery jokes he made about Jack, last year, into sandwich jokes about Joe.It may all change overnight, of course.  Then  again, it may not, and ITV may even have designed the show to be under- stated, after all the controversy sur- rounding it earlier in the year, by choosing contestants who were better equipped emotionally to cope with the process.It may all change overnight, of course.  Then  again, it may not, and ITV may even have designed the show to be under- stated, after all the controversy sur- rounding it earlier in the year, by choosing contestants who were better equipped emotionally to cope with the process.Either way, it’s not terminal.Nothing happening on Love Island is still a more enticing prospect for a lot of people than every- thing happening in politics.And  it’ll stay that way so long as ITV doesn’t kowtow to the point-missing Twitter morons who think Love Island should be filled with “plus-size”contestants. ’Cos, yes, Lucie and co are more beautul and toned than the rest of us, but, as a result, they’re also duller and dumber, to the point they can’t even be trusted to make a cup of tea unsupervised.We’re laughing at them, not with them andyou take away that fun, you’ll ruin the ratings, kill the show and get the same resigned reaction from everyone.It is what it is.THERE was a sting in the tail at the end of last week’s breathtaking Chernobyl finale, when it was revealed Emily Watson’s character, the scientic conscience of this Sky Atlantic drama, didn’t exist.There was no Ulana Khomyuk.She was a box-ticking amalgamation of all the scientists who cam- paigned for the truth to come out about the disaster.Some may object, but I thought Chernobyl more than earned the right-on indulgence.It was also preferable to the sort of carnage the BBC’s drama department and its precious ersity quotas would’ve brought to the period and production.That’s , of course, the Beeb ever had the balls to tackle a subject that doesn’t fit into its narrow, Student Union view of the world.Three men were eventually put on show trial for causing the disaster, you see.Chernobyl left you in no doubt, however, the real criminal was the Soviet Union, whose toxic socialism – supported by most of the current leading figures in the Labour Party – starved, murdered and poisoned its citizens and lied to them with almost every word.It even continued lying to them long after the disaster, and Valery Legasov’s heroic speech to the criminal trial, which was so brilliantly recreated here by actor Jared Harris.“Every lie we tell incurs a debt to the truth. Sooner or later that debt is paid.”It’s open to debate whether the disaster, as Mikhail Gorbachev’s  quote in the credits suggested, led to the collapse of the Soviet Union.What’s undeniable is that Chernobyl is one of the greatest TV dramas of the century.The beautul and touching tribute  Up paid to Lynn Johnson.

U.S. researchers followed the sleeping habits of nearly , women.The study found those who kept a light or TV on while they snoozed at night were  per cent more likely to be obese than those in total darkness.And they had a  per cent higher chance of weighing in at least lbs heavier on the scales.They also were less likely to have consistent waking and bedtime patterns and at greater risk of having less sleep, taking a longer time to doze off and needing to nap during the day.Scientists claim cutting exposure to articial light at night may be a simple weapon in the battle against the bulge.Two in three UK adults are overweight or obese. Being too heavy increases the chances of type  diabetes, heart, liver disease and several common cancers.One theory is that light exposure alters key hormones that control the body clock. It may also trigger the release of stress hormones that contribute to weight gain.Writing in the JAMA Internal Medicine, researcher Dr Dale Sandler, from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in North Carolina, said: “Exposure to articial light at night while sleeping was signicantly associated with an increased risk of weight gain and the development of obesity.“In particular, sleeping with a television or a light on in the room was positively associated with gaining kg or more.“Public health strategies to decrease obesity might consider interventions aimed at reducing articial light at night while sleeping.”Previous UK research has found girls who have TVs in their bedrooms are a third more likely to be fat.Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said televisions and smartphones should be banned from kids’ rooms at night.He said: “It has been known for a long time that the blue, articial light emitted by TV screens - even those simply on stand-by - can mess up the bodys cyclical rhythms and disrupt sleep patterns.“Add to that research which has already linked interrupted sleep to obesity and diabetes and the case is made to ditch any gadget with a screen from the bedroom.Though adults might find that dficult, parents should make that a mandatory ban on their children .Commenting on the study, body clock expert Professor Malcolm von Schantz from Surrey University, said: “The findings make perfect biological sense.We know that light in the late evening will delay our body clocks. We know from experimental studies in people that light at night affects our metabolism in ways that are consistent with increased risk of metabolic syndrome.“These new findings won’t change the advice to maintain good sleep hygiene, and avoid light and electronic distractions in the bedroom, but they add further strength to the case for this advice.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Single OAPs over the age of  with a weekly income of less than £. or couples with a weekly income of less than £. will continue to qualy for the free TV licence.The PM said she was “very disappointed” with the decision and said it was a clear breach of its commitment to take on the financial burden of providing the giveaway.In a furious response to the announcement, the PM’s spokesman said: “We have been clear that we expected the BBC to continue this concession. We want the BBC to look again at ways of supporting older people.”He added: “As part of the long-term funding agreement, the BBC agreed to take on responsibility for this concession in  and we have been clear that we expected the BBC to continue this concession.“In  , it received over £. billion in licence fee income - more than the year before - and we have guaranteed the licence fee will increase with inflation until .“They are also making over £ billion a year from commercial work, such as selling content abroad, which can be reinvested.“It is the BBC’s responsibility to ensure its substantial licence fee income is used in an appropriate way so that it can deliver for UK audiences.”But critics blasted the PM for passing the buck - pointing out that her  General Election manesto pledged to keep the free TV licence.The Age UK charity warned the move will directly impact the sick and disabled.Labour’s former PM Gordon Brown warned that the move risked turning pensioners into criminals.He stormed: “This is the wrong decision, made in the wrong way by the BBC.“It should not be an agency for means-testing pensioners. Any costs should be covered by the Government without endangering BBC services.”And Labour’s deputy leader and Shadow Culture Secretary Tom Watson blamed the Government’s decision to handover control and burden of paying for free licences to the BBC as part of its new charter.Mr Watson said: “It is an outrage that this Government is overseeing the scrapping of free TV licences for three million older people, leaving a Tory manesto promise in tatters.“I challenge all Tory leadership candidates to honour the commitment they made in . You cannot means-test for social isolation.“You cannot means-test for loneliness. Millions of elderly and isolated people will lose because of this announcement.”The new scheme will cost the BBC around £ million by  , depending on the take-up.BBC director-general Tony Hall said the decision was “dficult” but was the “fairest for the poorest pensioners”.It said thatit bore the full financial burden of the free licences, the extra cost would have meant “unprecedented closures”.This would have included the closures of BBC Two, BBC Four, the BBC News Channel, the BBC Scotland channel, Radio live and a number of local radio stations, as well as other cuts and reductions.But the National Union of Journalistsbranded the decision to means-test licence fees “a wrongheaded act of sabotage by a government”, and urged the Government to take back responsibility for financing the benefit.NUJ general secretary Michelle Stanistreet said: “Journalists and programme-makers have borne the brunt of cuts at the BBC for many years and have simply had enough of the BBC being victim to political grandstanding.”The National Pensioners Conventionalso turned on the Government following the announcement, and condemned the BBC for attempting to frame the move as fair.NPC general secretary Jan Shortt said: “There is no doubt that the BBC has done the Government’s dirty work for it.“Pensioner poverty is now increasing, loneliness is reaching crisis levels among older people and the BBC has the bare-faced cheek to call this fair. It’s an absolute disgrace.”Conservative Damian Collins, chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, said: “The ending of historically free TV licences for all those over , regardless of income, will mark a signicant departure for the BBC and nearly four million pensioners who don’t pay for it.“We at the DCMS Committee will continue to monitor the BBC, and in particular the impact that this cost will have on the BBC’s future and its programming.“The select committee intends to question the chairman and director-general of the BBC about the results of its consultation and the impact this will have on viewers and listeners.”The free licence fee was first paid for by a Labour government in .WHO is affected by this Around . million over-s who are not eligible to claim Pension Credit.Single OAPs over  with a weekly income of less than £. or couples with a weekly in- come of less than £. will continue to qualy for the free TV licence.An estimated . million over-s will continue to get the free TV licence.When will the changes come in June , .Why is this happening  Because David Cameron’s government de­c­ided to hand over control and the burden of funding the TV licence fee to the BBC as part of the new charter agreement with the broadcaster.Is it likely to be reviewed A future government might review the decision to hand control of the fee to the BBC, but the broadcaster is unlikely to change its decision by itself having consulted widely on the move. THE BBC spends fortunes on its highly-paid stars’ salaries.

He insisted he was in the race “to win it” after being urged to step down by senior Tories after admitting taking cocaine. And he goaded Mr Johnson over his decision to quit the contest last time round telling him “whatever you do, don’t pull out”.

But it was Mr Gove’s attacks which will sting Mr Johnson the most after the last contest when he dealt the fatal blow to his campaign.  To titters from the audience, he told his former friend: “If I get through, which I’m sure I will actually, to the final two against Mr Johnson this is what I will say to him. Mr Johnson, whatever you do, don’t pull out”. He added: “I know you have before and I know you may not believe in your heart that you can do it but the Conservative Party membership deserve a choice’.” Mr Johnson has a long history of personal indiscretions including numerous extra-marital affairs, two orces and a love child.  Mr Gove was later forced to denied that he was making a personal attack.    “It was purely about the last leadership contest. It wasn’t anything more than that. Some people have much more imagination than I have,” he said. But asked at the launchhe would give Mr Johnson a job, he replied: “I’m a great fan of Boris’s I enjoy working with him but I think the first person I should discuss that with is Her Majesty the Queen.” Mr Gove, who allies said would unveil more backers in coming days, was just one of the leadership rivals who slapped down Mr Johnson on his tax cut plan for the rich.  The former foreign secretary prompted fury by pledging a cut - which would benefit him and every other MP but not the poorest.  The millionaire Tory wants to raise the p income tax threshold from £, to £,he becomes Prime Minister.  Anyone earning more than £, that sum looks set to save up to £, in income tax every year, though once other taxes are taken into account the benefit would be smaller. He claimed the move would be paid for by cash currently set aside for No Deal - yet insists that he is keeping No Deal on the table.  Mr Gove vowed to never use the tax and benefits system to “give the already wealthy another tax cut” Health Secretary Matt Hancock, another candidate, laid into the plan, saying he would only cut taxes “when we can afford it”. Hard Brexiteer Dominic Raab also put the boot in.“Think about what it looks like for the next Prime Minister going into those Labour marginal seats,” he said.“I’d much rather be going in there saying I’m going to cut taxes for the lowest paid than succumbing to what would inevitably look like the caricature that we are the party of privilege and only help the wealthy.”Mr Johnson also came under fire over Brexit with Mr Hunt warning that his plan to quit without a deal on October  could lead to a general election which would “annihilate” the Tories. The Foreign Secretary said that he would only back No Deal “with a heavy heart”  - and would keep delaying Brexit on the tablethere was a deal “in sight”.  After winning the backing of Cabinet Brexiteer Penny Mordaunt, he added: “A wise Prime Minister would make choices on the basis of the options in front of them on the table at that time.” Cabinet minister Amber Rudd slammed candidates who claimed the UK should simply “pick up some magic beans and believe in Britain”.

The Department for Work and Pensionspublished the estimate two days after campaigners began a fight against the change in the High Court. It is more than double the last estimate of £bn, made in , due to changes in how the figure is measured. It shows the huge scale of the battle facing campaigners who argue the changes - affecting around .million women - were unlawful discrimination. Women born in the s are having their state pension age hiked to make it  by , the same as for men. Activists say the change came at too short notice, warning letters didn’t arrive and happy retirements were robbed.Last week lawyers for two of the women affected, backed by the Back to  campaign, began a landmark legal case against the changes in the High Court.   Back to  campaign director Joanne Welch today claimed the timing of the new figures was a tactical move by the government to mislead public opinion as to the costs. She said: s-born women have a legitimate expectation to receive their state pension at  years of age - which was woven into the fabric of society. And they demand theof those earned dues. She said Back to  is working on its own estimate of how much the groupaposs demands would cost. She added: We are certain that the governmentaposs figures do not hold any water whatsoever in regards to our Judicial Review. A DWP official insisted the figuresapos release was pre-announced four days in advance, and that the figures were required to be published as they were used as part of the court case. The DWPaposs new figures examine the theoretical cost of reversing the womenaposs state pension age rise back to age , and the menaposs rise back to . On costs of the state pension alone, the DWP said reversal would cost £.bn for men and £.bn for women. Once both the costs of other pensioner benefits and savings from working-age benefits are included, reversal would cost £.bn for men and £.bn for women - a total of £.bn.  The estimates cover the period from   to   and are stated in   prices. The DWP said there are several reasons why the new estimate is so much higher than the £bn figure in . The costs cover the period from -, rather than the - period covered by the previous estimate. The new estimate also includes costs and savings from changes to benefits, assumes pensions will be uprated, factors in the New State Pension, and states the costs in   prices rather than   prices. The figures were, however, also met with doubt by Anne Keen, founder of campaign group Women Against State Pension Inequality . WASPI is separate to the Back to  campaign and Ms Keen said she is campaigning for fair transitional arrangements, rather than a full-blown reversal. She said: WASPI supporters and founders would take issue with any cost analyses provided by the DWP.

Mariyka’s amazing story did not feature in the recent TV hype over the Soviet atomic power station, but she is said to be a symbol of Chernobyl renaissance following the disastrous explosion. She hit the headlines  years ago when she became the first and only baby to be born and brought up living close to blitzed reactor number four. But she has not been seen in the media for years.  Now a -year- old student at a leading higher education institution in Ukraine’s capital Kiev, she was tracked down by the Sunday Express and said: “I am doing well, I am working. “I’m providing for myself. This is it.”  When she was born in , the Ukrainian authorities sought to hide the “embarrassment” of her arrival to a family of Chernobyl workers living illegally in the -mile exclusion zone.    Her parents refused to leave the zone because the authorities offered them no alternative housing. But they were harassed and accused of “murdering” their daughter. She swam in a river where fish - which her father Mikhail caught to feed the family - sent Geiger counters bleeping wildly, says the newspaper. She drank milk from a cow fed on Chernobyl pastures irradiated by the nuclear explosion.  Her mother Lydia Sovenko was forced to deny rumours over her daughter’s health. If people think she is a mutant, or has two heads, they are quite wrong,” she said in one interview. She is a lovely child who is absolutely healthy as far as we can see.” Today Mariyka does not wish to highlight her past as she funds her studies working at a fashionable bar. She really doesnapost care about being unique through being born in Chernobyl, said a friend.  In fact, knowing that she is the only child who was born here after the explosion, and who grew up in Chernobyl, is rather painful for her. “She sees it as a stigma. Her health and success - confirmed by her mother and friends - comes as the nature of Chernobyl is fighting back against the appalling nuclear decimation it suffered  years ago. Wildle is teeming in the area with elk, deer, wild boar and wolves thriving as well as rare wild birds and flowers, some of them from the Red Book. As her mother, now , has said: People here believe that Mariyka is a symbol of Chernobylaposs renaissance, a sign from God which they interpret as a blessing to live here, and that le is coming back to this blighted place.” "},{"url":null,"title":"boy 6 runs up 1600","story":"NewsBoy, , runs up £, Fortnite bill on skint uncles PlayStation accountAsad Murad, , from Stockport, Greater Manchester, says he is now \"completely skint\" after losing four months of savings in one dayShareCommentsBySophie Halle-Richards:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsAsad with his nephew Alex \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA six-year-old boy ran up a £, bill when he went on a shopping spree while playing Fortnite on his uncleaposs PlayStation account.

In the past month a ton of the animalaposs flesh - known as bush meat - was confiscated at customs as it came into the UK from West Africa, leading primate scientist Dr Ben Garrod said. The meat can cause serious diseases as chimps are genetically similar to humans and it is often packaged in unsanitary environments. Western chimpanzees are on the critically endangered species list due to threats to their environment and because their meat is considered a delicacy.   Itaposs re, itaposs in all major cities across Europe and the US, the University of East Anglia professor told The Sunday .We have seen bush meat confiscated in the UK in checkpoints at borders and in markets. Itaposs often brought to the country for specic celebrations like a wedding or a Christening. World renowned chimpanzee expert Dr Jane Goodall urged the government to take action and to introduce DNA testing at the border. She suggested that Interpol should up its efforts to stop the meat being taken across borders and suggested dogs could be trained to detect the product. Bush meat is easier than other contraband goods to smuggle because it is smoked and blackened, making it hard to identy.    It can sell for as much as five times the price of prime cuts of beef or pork. The issue of illegal meat being imported into European countries is not a new one. During a  day period in ,  passengers from  flights were searched coming into Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris. Almost half were found to be carrying fish or meat from livestock or wild animals including crocodiles, primates and porcupines. In  chimpanzee meat was found in the West Midlands during a trading standards raid. A spokesperson for the government said: As well as working with enforcement and intelligence partners in the UK and international, Border Force continues to invest in training and equipment to ensure that we do all we can to intercept illegal foodstuffs and cracks down on smugglers.

Simon Aherne and Anna Cousins said the switch - announced with a yearaposs notice - will scupper their wedding plans because most guests will now be unable to attend. The couple, from Cardf, say they have already booked a venue and caterers, and sent invitations to more than  family and friends. They say their plans went out the window when the Government announced the change on Saturday.  The couple have invited more than  people but they will barely get  now. If they cancel, they will lose hundreds of pounds in deposits, they said. The Government said it made the decision as soon as practicable.Mr Aherne, a teacher and part-time DJ, told the BBC: Most of our family are teachers or in the entertainment business - so the bank holiday worked out perfectly for us.   Now we are just sitting here wondering what we are going to do. Mr Aherne and Ms Cousins, a PR worker, are due to get married at Kingscote Barn in Gloucestershire May ,  - a Sunday and the day before the traditional bank holiday Monday. The couple say they respect wishes to mark the VE Day anniversary, but they have hit out at the government, saying there was a lack of warning. Mr Aherne said: How can the government just chuck this on people with  months to go  They have had time to prepare and could have given people a lot more notice.  VE Day – or Victory in Europe Day – is marked on  May and commemorates the Allies accepting the surrender of Nazi Germany in the Second World War. The May Day bank holiday is traditionally held on a Monday but will be put back to the Friday and form part of a three-day weekend of commemorative events. Sir Andrew Gregory, the chief executive of SSAFA, the armed forces charity, said it was a fitting idea. He said: “It is our duty to keep the events of the past alive in collective memory, including future generations – this is how we ensure that such a conflict never happens again. It is our hope that the nation takes a moment to reflect on the signicance of this date, as a milestone that changed the course of history for the whole world.”  The announcement follows events across the UK and France to mark the th anniversary of the D-Day landings. As part of the VE Day commemorations, more than , pubs will encourage drinkers to toast the heroes of the war while churches will take part in a “ringing out for peace”. The bank holiday will move in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but not necessarily in Scotland as bank holidays are devolved to Holyrood. The business secretary, Greg Clark, said moving the bank holiday was a “right and fitting tribute”. He added: “VE Day marked an historic moment in not only our nation’s but the world’s history and it is important that we commemorate this great occasion on its th anniversary.

Cai Williams, his we Leonna, their three children and some extended family members were flying out to celebrate Heather Schofieldaposs th birthday. The family-of-five from Caerphilly, Wales, paid a total of £, for flights and accommodation and £, for park entry for the two weeks.It was intended to be a special birthday celebration, and a holiday of a letime for Heather, her three daughters, husband and children, Wales Online reports.   But there was a hitch even before they left the UK. Holiday operators Thomas Cook contacted them to say that instead of flying from Gatwick they would be flying from Manchester. Eventually the flights were changed back but when they arrived at the airport they were told there had been no allocation for their baggage, and they had to pay extra to put their luggage on. The travellers spent around an hour arguing their case before they were let on board without paying extra. After an eight-hour flight the party arrived at the Rosen Inn International Hotel in Orlando only to be told their rooms were not available for another two days. The family feared the worst, but the hotel allowed them to stay overnightthey paid £ per family for a room - which they were hoping to redeemthey could sort the situation out with holiday reps before am the next day. But for the Williams family, and the others, the situation was far from ideal.    There were just two three-quarter sized beds in the shared room. This meant their -year-old daughter Alise, Ruby, seven, and Oliver, five, all had to share one bed. The family said the original hotel they had been booked into, which was changed before the holiday because of potential noise issues, was a self-catering suite, but the hotel rooms had minimal facilities, which meant they had to eat out more often. Mr Williams said he thought that added another £, to the cost of his immediate familyaposs holiday. He said the first couple of days were spent trying to sort out the issue with the holiday reps, who were very helpful at the resort. But that meant they missed out on the first days of their two-week pass to the Disney attraction. Eventually the family was given a temporary bed for the room. An attempt to be moved to another hotel failed, as they were told all the similar hotels were booked up.  But the final straw was when the families were coming to the end of their holidays and found out they should have had vouchers to cover their breakfast - but these hadnapost been provided and they had paid for their meals. Mr Williams said: We just want some answers. It was disgusting. My we, my children, my mother-in-law - all they did was cry. I It was horrible. That night at reception, not knowingwe had a room, the kids were really scared. They were also knackered. A Thomas Cook spokeswoman said: We’re very sorry for the inconvenience caused to all the family at the beginning of their trip to Florida. We recognise we made a mistake with the hotel booking and we’re investigating the issues raised. In resort, we did everything we could to try and put things right, including offering meal vouchers. After the initial mix-up with the accommodation Thomas Cook said no further complaint was made in the resort. On May  the customers complained to Morgan Travel, not Thomas Cook direct.

The improvements include installing articial grass and a play area for the children. However the fox family, two adults and five cubs, tunneled under the decking and set up home.    The cute foxes then trashed the garden by tearing up the grass and pooing all over the place. Paediatric first aid trainer Zoe, and Dan, , are convinced the flea-ridden foxes and their excrement pose a health risk to their two young daughters Amber, eight, and Millie, five. The girls are scared to play in the garden and were left traumatised after finding a drowned fox cub in their paddling pool. Zoe has been advised to wait until autumn when the foxes are likely to leave of their own accord.    There is no known case of people catching diseases from foxes or their droppings in Britain, according to thefoxwebsite.net.

With the -year-old Queen still putting in the hard graft in central London, Prince Philip finds himself away from his we in a bid to enjoy the peace and quiet of the country. On the day he officially won the title of longest-serving consort in British history, the Duke had his birthday marked with a -gun salute at noon in Londonaposs Hyde Park.

Police are appealing for witnesses to the sickening vandalism which took place at Twyford Wood in Lincolnshire. During World War Two the site was used as an airfield where many soldiers flew out for the Normandy invasion. A number of areas within the wood have been defaced with swastikas in silver and white spray paint. These include a commemorative bench which remembers those soldiers who flew out from the site on D-Day.    Earlier this month veteran American Second World War pilot Lt Col David Hamilton, , made an emotionalto the wood which was formerly RAF North Witham,  years after he flew from there on a perilous pre-invasion mission on the eve of D-Day. His visit was marked by a special flyover of an original WWll Douglas C Skytrain. Lt Col David Hamilton, , is the last surviving Troop Carrier Command pilot from a special operations Pathfinder mission on June , , flown from RAF North Witham, which is now Twyford Wood near Colsterworth, owned by Forestry England. Months had been spent training in secrecy for the mission – to drop men of the US Army’s st and nd Airborne Divisions behind enemy lines in Normandy. Their task was to secure landing areas and set up navigational aids to guide in the main airborne invasion force of C aircraft carrying paratroopers and towing gliders.    Lt Col Hamilton was taken to the former airfield and driven to key points, including the threshold of the runway he took off from on June , and the control tower. His visit was marked by a special flyover of an original WWll Douglas C Skytrain. As a final act, he unveiled a new commemorative interpretation board installed in Twyford Wood to tell the story of the mission. Speaking during his visit the US veteran said: This whole visit has been just marvellous and just so much better than I could ever have imagined. I am so grateful to everyone. “I am very surprised to see how much of the airfield is left. I expected to find a field with cattle grazing.”  The vandalism has left locals outraged. Eve Thompson said: I bet these little shots wouldnapost give their lives for their country. Jon Hare added: No way would they be able to do what those veterans did for usAmanda Scarratt said: Words fail me. A Lincolnshire Police spokesman said: Between Sunday th June and Monday th June, a number of areas within the Twyford Woods site have been defaced with Swastikas in silver and white spray paint. This includes a commemorative bench which has been extensively vandalised. We are appealing for witnesses to this vandalism and anyone with any information that can assist with our investigation.

Researchers scouring government data found there are some , rental transactions a year across the UK, with the average tenant is being charged £ in fees alone. But under new laws set out in the Tenant Fee Act  landlords and letting agents will not be permitted to charge exorbitant, arbitrary fees – saving Brits a massive £,, a year. Tom Woollard, co-founder and CEO of Bunk, which carried out the research, said: “For far too long letting agents have essentially been writing their own rules when it comes to the fees they charge tenants for all manner of things, and as a result, it has left a very sour taste in the mouths of many in the renal sector.    “The ban on tenant fees is undoubtedly a step in the right direction as we now have a clear piece of legislation that letting agents, landlords and tenants can all adhere to with a good level of accountability when this isn’t the case. “Until this point, the majority of letting agents have essentially been taking extra money above and beyond any justied fees for no additional work and so the thought that they might try and recoup this ‘lost’ revenue through rental hikes or any other means is quite laughable. “Only time will tellthis does happen and there will no doubt be a knee-jerk reaction of some sort by the industry. “Hopefully it will act as a catalyst for the sector to stand up and show it can provide a good service for a reasonable fee, and that letting agents still hold some value in a world where technology and innovation will undoubtedly render them obsolete.” Bunk has launched a new online  to recoup losses for landlords and streamline the process for tenants.    Founded by three university graduates and based in Bristol the app aims to help landlords minimise costs, which they can no longer recoup through fees, whilst making the whole process simple and affordable for renters. A recent study by ARLA showed that  per cent of letting agents surveyed were looking to increase their costs towards landlords as a result of the Tenant Fee ban. Some  per cent of letting agents believe rent prices will increase as a direct result of the ban, putting pressure on some of the country’s more vulnerable tenants. But that is something hybrid letting agency Bunk is looking to avoid by offering more efficient, technology-driven solutions for landlords and tenants. Woollard, , added: “Unlike most agents, we don’t need to increase landlord fees. “As other agents go down that route, we are passing real savings onto our customers across the UK.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman claims roadworks ruined marriage","story":"NewsWoman claims roadworks ruined her marriage and forced to home school kidsSarah Banner has blamed the Girton Interchange on the A in Cambridgeshire for the break up of her marriageShareCommentsByMilo Boyd:,  JUN NewsSarah Banner and her daughter India have struggled with the noise for years\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA sleep-deprived mum has blamed roadworks for ruining her marriage.

But with each encroachment of the road, I have seen our standard of living slipping, our health both physically and emotionally being directly affected, and an inability to change our circumstance. The standard of living had been so bad for the family that India had to be taken out of primary school. She would go into school being unable to concentrate, being so tired from no sleep, said Ms Banner. So I had to take her out of school and home-school her. We now travel together to Norfolk every so often to catch up on sleep. Itaposs peaceful there. A Highways England spokesperson said: We are working very hard to limit the impact of the A upgrade on local communities and we are always open to ideas for how we can improve. “Upgrading the A is a massive job. It includes a brand new bypass for Huntingdon, as well as widening existing sections of the A and the A, and we are working very hard to be a good neighbour and try to keep disruption during construction to a minimum, especially during the night.

Lee, whose name was changed, claims that for five years she and a handful of other girls were imprisoned in a tiny apartment in north east China. The broker she trusted to plan her escape from North Korea sold her to a cybersex operator. Leeaposs story is a common one, reports CNN.According to a report by London-based Korea Future InitiativeNorth Korean women are often enslaved in brothels, sold into repressive marriages or made to perform graphic acts in front of webcams in satellite towns near cities close to Chinaaposs border with North Korea.   Lee was saved when the stranger she was talking to online turned out to be a -year-old pastor from South Korea.

A bruised and battered face caused alarm on first viewing which gave way to quite a lot of laughter and bold comment.But what a delightful party, laid on by our warden Sheena Stewart and ladies and saw we all had tea, coffee, and home baking, including shortbread and sconesand presents of wine and malt whiskey. What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

We are also inviting them to meet with us in person in Brussels and with our permanent staff in our Brussels office, the British Agriculture Bureau.Andrew McCornickMinette BattersJohn Daviesand Ivor Ferguson "},{"url":null,"title":"show us your mojo","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowDon#t miss out on your chance to play on MOJO#s unique live stage on October  in Ardfern.Bands have only three weeks left to enter their demo on to MOJO organisers, so don#t delay to be part of this exclusive night of original live music.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert.

Eventually they evolved into the largest creatures ever known # the titanosaurs, including the aptly named Dreadnoughtus #  metres long and weighing more than ,kg –  times heavier than an African elephant.Like most youngsters, dinosaurs fascinated me in primary school, but I never thought to ask how they sustained their enormous bulk. As Brusatte describes in his brilliant book*, the answer is their unique body plan.Adult titanosaurs needed to eat around kg of foliage daily, a feat accomplished by the addition, and enlarging, of vertebrae to extend their distinctive necks. So, by just standing still and swinging their heads, they could consume all plants within a -metre-diameter circle, while expending very little energy.But how did they manage to move around when just lting their heads and feet appears to defy gravity  Everything is explained by adaptations to their respiratory system, which combined an energy-generating machine and an air-con system, which also helped movement.Titanosaur lungs were connected to numerous air sacs that filled body cavities, even burrowing extensively into bones. Air sacs stored oxygen-rich air that passed through the lungs in one direction only, allowing for super-efficient oxygen extraction. What’s more, the air sacs# huge surface area dissipated heat, so averting heat stress. And finally, by creating a honey-comb effect in bones, air sacs lightened without weakening the skeleton, thereby allowing animals to move around with ease.If only we could have met these giants. But at least theirclose relatives are around today. Birds are dinosaurs. And with the same efficient respiration and light-weight bones they can fly far and high, even over Mount Everest.*Steve Brusatte, Author of The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs ."},{"url":null,"title":"even tunnel vision has its drawbacks","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOur regular artistic contributor Ann Thomas this week muses on a subject she has mulled over before # the Rest and be Thankful.Transport Scotland is undertaking a review of the country#s strategic transport strategy, with an undertaking that Argyll will be at the front of the queue this time around.We#ll see, but in the meantime a tunnel through the hills is considered by some to be the answer to solving the problem of keeping Argyll connected via the A by avoiding the landslide risk altogether.But there may be some drawbacks to a super underground highway#PIC:no_acartoon"},{"url":null,"title":"cressida-is-bringing-dragons-wizards-and-spells-to-the-land-of-her-inspiration","story":"HOW to Train Your Dragon author Cressida Cowell cant wait toto the land of her inspiration.The award-winning writer is among the start-studded line up for this years Family Book Festival in Melrose.Cressida is launching the second instalment of The Wizards of Once series at the Borders Book Festival on Saturday, June .Twice Magic is yet another slice of high-octane adventure set in a magical time of wizards, warriors, giants and sprites.Since the first book in the series was published last year, it has been sold in over  dferent languages, won several major awards and is currently being turned into a new Dreamworks film.But the author and illustrator is relishing ato the country which first inspired her most popular series of books, How to Train Your Dragon.With more than eight million books sales and hugely successful film and television adaptations, How to Train Your Dragon has become a firm favourite with children around the world.Cressida, who spent family holidays as a girl in Scotland, told us: \"My father was a great birder and environmentalist and we would spend our summers on an island off the west coast where there was no electricity.\"We would read but he would also tell us lots of stories about where we were and one, that I always remember, was about a dragon on nearby Mull.

Galashiels ndash who was a Captain and i c of A Company, st Battalion Kingrsquos Own Scottish Borderers, in the second assault wave on the morning of June .By June , , the Battalion had moved into the marshalling area Camp A. By this time all ranks of the Battalion had been briefed on maps with bogus name and map references - but everyone was fully in the lsquopicturersquo as to the plan for the invasion of the continent . The time in A was spent testing weapons and lsquoteeingrsquo up all the last details for the lsquobig dayrsquo.In the early morning of June , the Battalion embussed in TCVs and moved to the final Assembly area at Victoria Barracks, Plymouth. At am we were informed that owing to bad weather the operation had been postponed  hours.On June  we again moved to Victoria Barracks and at  hours started embarking on LSIs , although there was a fairly heavy sea running. The Battalion was on board by .. We sat at anchor until . when we set sail for the big adventure for which most of us had been waiting four years. It was an amazing sight, all around as far as the eye could see, there were ships of all shapes and sizes bobbing up and down on the water with their ensigns flying bravely in the summer breeze. As we passed the flag ship, with our Divisional Commander, Major-General Rennie and Admiral Vian on board, all ranks turned out on deck and saluted while the pipers played our Regimental march ldquoBlue Bonnets orsquoer the Border.The sea journey was one of the worst we had experienced, there was a heavy swell running and most of the Battalion felt very ill. After midnight maps were issued and from these, we saw we were scheduled to lsquotouch downrsquo at Lion-Sur-Mer about three miles west of Ouistreham.About . on June  we could see faintly the coast of Normandy on the horizon, all around us were battleships, cruisers and destroyers firing at the enemy, while overhead there was a continual stream of bombers and fighters. As we drew nearer the shore, we could see LCAs, DUKWs, etc ferrying stores from larger ships to shore.At . we were ordered to lsquostand byrsquo to disembark. Each man carried his normal equipment and personal weapon plus to extra bandoliers of ammunition, two -hour ration packs and an airborne bicycle. We had expected a wet landing but when we touched down, dead on time at ., we stepped off the LCI on to the shore. The Navy had certainly put up a terric show and now it was up to us.It took only a few minutes for the Battalion to disembark and then we moved off to our Assembly area north of Hermanville-Sur-Mer , this move was carried out without incident except for a few heavy shells from the coastal guns at Le Havre.At . the Battalion were ordered to move to St Aubin drsquoArquenay and ordered to lsquodig inrsquo. At . we witnessed what must be one of the most spectacular sights of the war - the landing of the Reserve Brigade of the th Airborne Division. It was certainly heartening for us, as up to then we had the feeling that we were all alone on the continent. Several prisoners were brought in during the night.Early on June  we prepared to attack the village of Gazelle. We moved on bicycles through Periers-Sur-le-Dan preparatory to the attack. At midday patrols reported Gazelle clear of the enemy and led by lsquoCrsquo Companythe Battalion moved through Gazelle to the woods north of Le Mesnil.We stayed until the morning of the th when we were relieved by the S Lancs while the Royal Ulster Rlesattacked Cambes Wood. At . the Battalion was ordered to pass through the RUR who had reached their objectives but were pinned down by heavy machine Gun, and Mortar Fire. The Battalion attacked after passing through the RUR and were met by machine gun fire and heavy mortar fire, but all Coys successfully reached their objectives. The Battalion suffered several casualties mainly from mortar fire.From June  to  the Battalion remained in Cambes Wood, where we were continually shelled and mortared and suffered fairly heavy casualties.Enemy mortar and artillery was very active ndash Battalion HQ receiving most attention. lsquoArsquo Coy HQ unfortunately came in for a very heavy lsquostonkrsquo and lost five killed and seven wounded. The end of the month saw the Battalion back in Cambes Wood once more, when we took over the right half of the line from the nd Lincs.During the month of June the Battalion sustained the following casualties two officers and  other ranks killed, eight officers and  other ranks wounded, and four other ranks missing.The Battalion remained in Cambes Wood till July . We continued to probe the enemy defences at night by patrolling. Sgt Grant carried out a very successful  hour patrol in the area of Galmanche. A lot of very valuable information was gained from this patrol. On the evening of July , Lt Robertson lsquoBrsquo Company carried out a very successful patrol and succeeded in bringing back identication of  SS Div ndash this information had been urgently required by higher command in view of the forthcoming attack.The Battalion were relieved by a Battalion of South Staffs and moved by march route to the area of Benouville in preparation for the attack on Caen. On the evening of July  the Battalion took over the nd Kings Shropshire Light Infantry in the area of Le Homme. A large formation of Allied bombers raided Caen in the early evening.On July  the Battalion again moved forward, this time to the area of Lebissey. There was some enemy mortar and artillery fire, but few casualties were suffered.On July  in conjunction with the RUR and Canadians, the Battalion attacked Caen. The Battalion was ordered to attack from the West with the RUR on our right. The Battalion moved to the Forming Up Pointon the outskirts of Caen. We were continually shelled from the Eastern side of the River Orne. It was a very unpleasant approach march to the FUP as the ground was completely open and overlooked from the high ground on the far side of the river. Led by lsquoCrsquo and lsquoDrsquo Coys the Battalion advanced into Caen and proceeded to winkle out the enemy. This proved a very slow job, the town had been heavily bombed and the roads crated or blocked by rubble, giving ideal cover from snipers and Spandau posts. By early evening all companies had reached their objectives, patrols established on the canal, and contact established with the RUR. The civilians gave everyone a terric welcome and produced wine, fruit and bouquets of flowers.On July  the Battalion continued to lsquomop uprsquo the town. There was slight enemy shelling during the day.On the morning of July , the Battalion were relieved by Canadians and moved to a rest area at Plumeto where the time was spent cleaning up, kit inspections and parades. Football games were organised and there was a generous allotment for film shows, swimming, etc. The Pipe Band played Retreat for the first time since landing, on the evening of the th. Officers and Other Rank reinforcements joined the Battalion and on the th we moved off at full strength to the area of Ranville, east of the Orne river, in preparation for operation lsquoGoodwoodrsquo, our objective in this operation was the important road centre of Troarn.On the morning of July , the Battalion moved off via Herouvillette, Touffreville to Sannerville. This was the worst approach march the Battalion had ever experienced. It was a hot summerrsquos day and having to follow the same route as an armoured Div and we were completely overlooked by the enemy. Enemy shells and mortaring was heavy and we experienced for the first time the enemyrsquos multi-barrelled mortarndash several casualties were suffered by the Battalion, including the CO, Lt. Col G.D. Renny. He was wounded in the face and arm but refused to be evacuated.On passing through the RUR at Sannerville lsquoDrsquo and lsquoBrsquo Coys pushed forward and encountered enemy machine guns. The enemy shelling continued throughout the whole advance. After lsquoBrsquo Coy had successfully put in an attack, the Battalion occupied an orchard about  yards west of Troarn where consolidation was carried out. During the night enemy shelling continued and enemy patrols encountered. On the th, the Battalion attack towards Troarn was continued, lsquoCrsquo Coy left ndash lsquoArsquo Coy right. Both Coys advanced, but were met with heavy machine gun fire, and although supported by tanks, were forced to withdraw with heavy casualties.The Battalion took up its former positions and spent a most unpleasant day of enemy mortar and shell fire.The C.O. was ordered to be evacuated by the Brigadier and Major T.G. Coverdale took over command of the Battalion. Casualties in the Battalion in this action were  officers and  other Ranks. To make things more unpleasant we had  hours solid rain. Enemy shelling and mortaring continued but our own guns had moved up and they did some very good counter battery shoots.On July , two enemy Stretcher Bearersapproached lsquoBrsquo Coy position and asked that they and ourselves should bury our dead who were lying in lsquoNo manrsquos landrsquo. A party of SBs under our Padre, Capt Wilson, went out and did this job. As in Cambes Wood some very good patrolling was done, and several prisoners were taken mostly from  Fusilier Battalion and  Panzer Grenadiers.On July , Lt. Col. J.F.M. MacDonald took over command of the Battalion. A strong enemy patrol attempted to penetrate lsquoBrsquo Coy position but were beaten off by small arms and two-inch mortar fire.

This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson,"},{"url":null,"title":"letter letters from alex orr","story":"In March you published a letter from John R Newall pointing out how inappropriate he thought it that the Courier chose to publish letters from an Alex Orr of Edinburgh when these letters were political promotional material from a professional organisation, promoting the SNP and would have been better published in a national newspaper.As I was quite sure Mr Orr is not a reader of the Courier I replied to him personally by Royal Mail at the Edinburgh address he provided with his letter.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area.

The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Awaiting more information at this time regarding CCTV to identy those involved.ldquoSaturday: a young woman and father involved in an altercation with staff and police, with the woman being detained for safety reasons [and] a domestic altercation between a couple from the committee in one of the main bars, with security from site required to attend to defuse the situation.The statement continued: ldquoThe committee will take into consideration all actions on the next steps that the club will be required to make.ldquoI will be contacting Flamingo Land separately to raise our concerns on the handling of the matter to punish -plus people based on the actions of a few and the treatment.\"My sincere apologies for the distress caused to everyone.One committee member offered their resignation, posting on Facebook: ldquoI would like to apologise to everyone that was at Flamingo Land on behalf of myself and the other member of the committee that was involved in the Saturday night antics ndash this should never have happened and we canrsquot apologise enough.ldquoThis will be something that we will always regret and feel very disappointed about and, out of respect to all the kids, we will be looking to stand down from the committee.ldquoWe have been with the club for years and can honestly say that it is a great club please donrsquot let the mistakes of a few ruin the hard work that goes into running the club.One angry parent said that the adults involved in allegedly alcohol-fuelled incidents ldquoought to be ashamed of themselves, calling the behaviour ldquodisgusting.They added: ldquoNot for a minute did I think that the people that were in charge of a group of youngsters would have set such a shocking example.ldquoItrsquos embarrassing.

Flamingo Land told me they have never thrown anybody out of the site as a group.ldquoA blocked toilet, while admittedly not great behaviour, would not get  kids thrown out of the resort. You all know the truth. Please be big enough to accept responsibility.ldquoTrying to blame -year-old boys is shameful.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The

Tranentrsquos eastern edge, despite the land being earmarked solely for economic development.Developers insisted that the only way to bring businesses onto the site was by generating funds from the sale of the new homes.They argued that making the site suitable for development would cost pound.million and it was not viable without housing.However, East Lothian Council rejected their plans at a meeting in August when officers insisted the site should be retained for employment use.Councillor John McMillan, economic spokesperson, referenced the Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams when he told colleagues: ldquoIf we build it, they will come.Developers appealed to the Scottish Government to overturn their decision, insisting the local authority had failed to acknowledge the evidence they had provided which, they said, demonstrated the need for enabling residential development on the land.However, the Scottish Government Reporter appointed to investigate the appeal has now rejected their argument, siding with the council.He said that the Local Development Plan for East Lothian had set aside the land at Kingslaw for economic development and it should be retained as such.And he pointed out that the housing proposed by Barratt,which was described as lsquowindfallrsquo housing ndash which refers to a site which becomes available unexpectedly ndash would ldquosimply supplement an already generous housing land supply.Despite rejecting the appeal, the reporter said that he accepted the views of the developers and the District Valuer that the site was not financially viable as employment land in the current market conditions.He said: ldquoWhile I cannot be certain that there is no prospect of a business or industrial use being realised on the whole site, the information for this appeal indicates that, in the current economic conditions, it would be unlikely.However, he questioned whether the plans to build  houses and provide the local authority with . hectares of ldquoserviced land to build business units on it were possible, with no evidence the units would be created or could operate next to the new residential development.The reporter said: ldquoI find that the housing proposed would not directly enable commercial development to take place.ldquoAlthough not likely to be currently viable, the site would be removed as a strategic long-term employment option.East Lothian Council welcomed the ruling which is the first housing appeal to have been ruled in their favour since their new Local Development Plan was adopted.Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: ldquoWe welcome the outcome of this appeal both in the context of the Scottish Government Reporter upholding a decision that was carefully considered by East Lothianrsquos

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9941039.jpg?type=article-full","title":"your-chance-to-help-a-vulnerable-child-enjoy-a-day-out-at-the-beach-with-quarriers","story":"Unfortunately, for reasons beyond their control, hundreds of children in Scotland will face six weeks of school holidays with no prospect of fun days out.Thatrsquos why the Summer Days Appeal by Quarriers, one of Scotlandrsquos leading social care charities, is asking for a small donation.

A pound token can help make sure that every child we support has a day out during the summer.ldquoMany of us will be planning elaborate holidays, but for some children and families just one day out can provide a vital break from everyday problems. To have these experiences is a really important part of growing up.Ruth provides some examples of the experiences that are made possible by the appeal.ldquoOur Family Resource Centre in Ruchazie is very much about getting families out together, but at other services children need a break from whatrsquos going on for them at home, so our support workers accompany the children.ldquoChildren can choose their own day out. One young man wanted to go to the art galleries in Glasgow.

While some HRCs are licensed to take trade waste, some businesses dispose of or recycle their waste asit was domestic waste, therefore not paying for their commercial waste to be disposed of. As well as taking up space meant for local householders’ recyclable materials and causing congestion at facilities, it also has legal and financial implications. Steps to tackle the issue are being proposed to each of the Council’s Area Committees to allow local councillors to give feedback, prior to final consideration by the Infrastructure Services Committee. It follows agreement on a new waste strategy for the area in January, designed to push up recycling rates and send less materials to landfill. Currently, as much as % of the waste taken to recycling centres is thought to be business waste, which should not be there.Disposal of business waste by these means is thought to be costing Aberdeenshire taxpayers around £, a year – money which could be better spent improving recycling services for households. Businesses would be prevented from using HRCs and instead directed to use council waste transfer stations at Banchory, Ellon and Macduff.At these facilities materials can be accurately weighed and charged for appropriately. As it is around half the cost to recycle materials than to landfill them, this gives businesses an incentive to consider which materials have the potential to be erted from landfill.This approach would also make it fairer to those businesses which already dispose of their waste through a paid-for collection service or by paying for the waste they take to recycling centres. To try to ensure businesses cannot continue to use HRCs unlawfully, a vehicle permit system is being proposed. data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Staff from Johnston Carmichael at the Aberdeen Kiltwalk\"  Firm goes extra mile for charities viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Certain types of vehicle typically used by businesses would not be permitted at HRCs, specically those over . tonnes gross weight, tippers, tractors, large trailers and vehicles with twin wheels or more than four wheels.Under the proposals householders who use commercial type vehicleswould be able to apply for free permits to access HRCs. Households would apply for the free permits in advance and a year’s supplywould be issued at one time to minimise inconvenience.Aberdeenshire Council’s Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: “The majority of households will not be affected by the proposed permit system as those using cars, MPVs, xs or hire vans would continue to have unlimited access to recycling centres.“The permit system is simply designed to address the fact that some households use commercial type vehicles – we understand this and they will be able to use the services in the same way as other members of their community, with a permit which shows staff they are entitled. “In the past we have seen situations where staff are put in a dficult position where they suspect someone disposing of materials at an HRC is linked to a business but cannot prove this. “The permit system will avoid any confusion and will make it perfectly clear that only household materials are permitted to be disposed of at our HRCs.“It is also really important that businesses take disposal costs into account when charging for work, paying appropriately for the waste they create. Following recent public engagement on budget setting, we know many residents agree with this approach that the council should not subsidise businesses. It is not for the taxpayer to pick up this bill on their behalf, hence these proposals."},{"url":null,"title":"poppy scotland s bud visits meldrum pupils","story":"Poppy Scotland#s travelling education vehicle, Bud, visited Meldrum Academy last week.Pupils in S and S had the opportunity to step inside the special vehicle so that they could learn more about the charity and the work it does.The Bud vehicle is interactive, giving pupils the chance to watch videos and they also had a go at making their own poppy.Bud aims to teach pupils about the Lady Haig Poppy Factory and showcases ious items from the Poppy Scotland archive including poppies from across the world.The academy was one of the few schools chosen in Aberdeenshire to get a visit from Bud thanks to the work of one of its pupils.S pupil Anna Jackson was a finalist in Poppy Scotland’s ‘Breaking News, War is Over’ competition.Meldrum Academy had five entries and Anna was selected as one of three finalists.She created her own newspaper, with the leading story announcing that war was over.Anna said: “I did research for it on the internet and I stained it with tea to make it look like it was from that time.“I was excited to make it to the finals.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Carolyn McKay on her practice walk at Lochnagar\"  Inverurie mum to trek Ben NevisviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Samantha Banks with her Official Make Up award\"  Top award for make-up artist viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"raft race hailed a success","story":"The Inverurie Raft Race celebrated its th anniversary at the weekend.Event organisers, Inverurie Scout Group, said they were “delighted” with the turnout of over  participants on Sunday, June .A total of  rafts entered the event this year.Over  people turned out to watch the race at dferent stages along the route, while it is estimated that over  people gathered at the finish line in Inverurie to watch the rafts come in.This was the first year that the Inverurie Scout Group took charge of the event after the previous hosts, Inverurie Lions, stood down due to a lack of volunteers.The Scouts are already discussing ways that they could improve the race for next year following their successful first event.At the race’s Inverurie end the Scout Group had support from all of its sections including the Beavers, Cubs, Scouts and Explorers.Speaking to the Herald Jackie McBeath of Inverurie Scout Group said: “It was great to see them enjoying themselves but also contributing to raising money for good causes in our area.“Our total raised is yet to be confirmed but it will be at least £, that will be split between Inverurie Scout Group, Kayleigh’s Wee Stars and MS Scotland.“This is an amazing amount to raise and has made me very proud to be part of the organising of this event on behalf of Inverurie Scout Group.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Russell being congratulated by his we Alyson, son Frankie and daughter Georgie after completing the marathon challenge\"  Russell runs  mile marathon for JackviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Equipment at Inverurie Police Station has been highlighted as unsuitable\"  Poor conditions highlighted at police stations viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"June ,  at : amThe three RNLI stations here in Orkney paid tribute after lesaving colleges in France lost their lives in a leboat tragedy on Friday.

According to these three parties, the new power supply system — known as #cold ironing# — will reduce the overnight carbon footprint from the vessel’s diesel generators and engines. It is believed that this will lower the ferry#s fuel consumption by at least  tonnes a year and resulting in a signicant reduction in carbon dioxide. It is also hoped that this will make a contribution towards further reducing nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides and noise.According to the organisations behind these plans, it will be £, cheaper to service MV Hamnavoe each year, as a result of the project. £, of funding was secured for the scheme from the European Regional Development Fund in August last year, with additional funding coming from OIC#s Miscellaneous Piers and Harbours fund and HITRANS.The scheme is expected to fully pay for itself in three years’ time through efficiencies and cost savings.Organisations behind the project say that other benefits will include the installation of an electric bus charger at the ferry terminal to open up opportunities for an electric vehicle to be used on the Stromness to Kirkwall route. There are also plans for the installation of electric vehicle charging points, as well as  electric bicycles for use by members of the public.For the full story, pick up a copy of The Orcadian, this Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

And I firmly believe that having a dedicated cabinet minister for Scotland is the best way to ensure our voice is heard.The Union is under threat. Making the case for Scotland’s place in the UK must remain as big a priority for the UK Government under a new Prime Minister as it is under Theresa May’s premiership.So the Scotland Office must also challenge misleading claims that are designed to undermine the Union. Claims about a ‘Westminster power grab’ as the UK leaves the EU, for example, or of relations between Scotland’s two governments breaking down. Those old myths resurfaced in the comment and commentary surrounding the SAC report and need to be called out. Far from there being a ‘power grab’, Scotland’s two governments are working constructively to create common frameworks in a number of devolved areas such as agriculture – but only where we all agree it makes sense to have some shared rules and regulations, just as we do now as part of the EU.Indeed, as a result of EU Exit there will be a signicant increase in the powers of Holyrood. I was very pleased the SAC acknowledged the collaborative approach to our new common frameworks of the UK, Scottish and Welsh governments.It is hugely important work that has the support of businesses on both sides of the border, and will strengthen the UK internal market that is so vital for the economy and jobs in Scotland.And the Committee’s conclusion also undermined chairman Pete Wishart’s subsequent claim that relations between Scotland’s two governments have ‘broken down’. That is simply not the case.During the course of the Committee’s inquiry the Scotland Office submitted detailed evidence showing the range and depth of engagement between the UK and Scottish Governments.It demonstrates a remarkable degree of joint working, at ministerial and official level, on everything from Brexit preparations to agriculture, from city deals to the transfer of Holyrood’s new welfare powers.The two governments have also been working together to ensure the mechanisms we have to support intergovernmental relations – such as our Joint Ministerial Committees – are fit for post-Brexit era of devolution.Now, of course, we have political disagreements and it would be silly to pretend we don’t. With a UK Government staunchly supportive of the Union and a Scottish Government campaigning for independence, there will always be tensions. But there is a clear dference between political disagreement and a failure of process.Yes, we’ll disagree but that does not mean our system of devolution has failed, that relations between our governments have collapsed or that Scotland has somehow been ignored or disrespected. It just means we don’t see eye to eye with Nicola Sturgeon.I’m afraid that’s going to happen from time to time.And as long as it does, I believe it makes sense to have a Scotland Office and a Secretary of State for Scotland making the strongest case for Scotland’s true interests at the heart of the UK Government.David Mundell is Secretary of State for Scotland©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"we owe it to the greatest generation to create country fit for heroes christine jardine","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Watching the commemoration from Normandy on Thursday morning I couldn#t help but think of my grandmother.What must she have gone through that morning  years ago when she heard that the operation to liberate occupied Europe had begun  Both sons were in the army.Then, a few days later she opened the telegram that explained her eldest son was missing.Somewhere in France.If you have ever read one of those communications they are the most achingly empty, and yet at the same time heart rending, pieces of writing.They convey a pain I can only imagine, but watching that ceremony on Thursday, I thought about how that pain had been sadly commonplace  years ago.That son, my Mum’s big brother Andrew had, like so many of his generation, volunteered to put himself in harm’s way to safeguard those things we now take for granted.I’m not ashamed to admit that I shed a tear when Theresa May so appropriately expressed what so many of us feel, when she described them as ‘the greatest generation’.But I also found myself wonderingthe words of thanks, important though they are, fall so far short of what we really ought to dedicate ourselves to in their memory.For my family the invasion of France had the happiest, and most fortunate, of outcomes when another message arrived to say that Andrew had been wounded but was safe.But growing up I was surrounded by aunts, uncles and family friends who had not been so lucky.Whose parents had been lost to them, in some cases either before they were born or before they had the chance to enjoy even one brief, cherished, encounter.They are in their later decades themselves now and I often wonder what they think of what we are making of the world they lost their parents for.What do they think of a country where food banks have become commonplace, for some their grandchildren and great grand children live in poverty and now even the NHS, that shining beacon of post-war British pride may, or may not, be up for sale to the United States And what about those who were born in the immediate post war years to parents who had survived the carnage  What are they thinking now Many of those children of war heroes are the generation caught up in the implications of the demographic bubble that was the inevitable consequence of the postwar baby boom.They are the ones now being punished by the shortage of funds for their social care.The taxes and national insurance they willingly paid now, in many places, no longer stretches to the cradle to grave care that the welfare state that grew up alongside them had promised.Some have even been caught up in the financial trap that was sprung on the so-called WASPI women.Born in the early s they worked all their lives expecting to retire at , only to find their pensions moved out of their reach just when they were planning to enjoy their retirement.I cannot be the only one who was struck by the irony of the case being brought by some of those women against the state for depriving them of their pensions by mismanagement, coming to court in the same week that their parents’ sacrice for that state is being recognised.My generation have been spared the horric experiences endured by those of both world wars.Of the years when the battle field extended to civilian communities across each country devastated by aerial bombing.Yes we have known financial crises, wars in the Falklands and the Gulf and the near constant threat of terrorism from one foe or another.And now we have Brexit.But all of that pales into insignicance in comparison.What we do have, by contrast, and what was spelled out in the clearest terms possible this week, are the opportunities that were created for us.My uncle’s war record was a source of enormous pride to every generation of our family. Enlisting as a private at the outbreak of war he eventually left the army a major. He and my other uncle raised four children between them in that ‘country fit for heroes’ to which they came home.And that is why, while I agree with every syllable of the sentiment expressed both by the Queen and by the Prime Minister this week, there is something I would like to add. Our responsibility to honour and respect that sacrice is not fulfilled solely by monuments and words of thanks.We also owe it to them to provide a system of welfare that will catch and safeguard their descendants without question when they fall into hardship.By building international alliances and treaties to safeguard both the peace we’ve enjoyed and the planet’s climate we can show respect for what they fought for.And, for those of us in a position of political or any other influence, only by putting the national and social interest before any other ideological or economic consideration do we live up to the promises they were made. Then perhaps we will measure up to the example of that ‘greatest generation’.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

You clearly misunderstood my point, which related to democracy.Clarity is a desirable quality of communication, in itself, neutral. As opposed to democracy, which is a fundamental principle by which we live and are governed.Liebe Rosa, you’ve fairly thrown down the gauntlet there!I agree, each translation has issues, but happily help is at hand within Shetland culture. Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us, saying that joy in this reunites us. He knew it was chance that saw us on one side or another of any nationalist driven war, and wanted to emphasise the need for healing and togetherness.It’s a concept of course that also is captured by Robert Burns ten years after Schiller in: For a’ that and a’ that, or Trotz alledem und alledem, as it also became in . The final lines guaranteed translation into many other language too:Shall brithers be for a# thatSchiller would also have recognised the romantic sensibilities which informed Shetland’s Up-Helly Aa, or unserer feuer-trunken Faschingsdeinstag, ob du wilst. I think these lines from the closing verse of The Galley Song capture Schiller’s intention perfectly:O’er stre the curtain drawHappy to see Europe inspiring Shetland still!#Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us#Unless of course they#re English eh Peter. You want to separate scotland from the rest of the UK yet come out with the PC BS above. just who are you trying to kid I wondered when the anti- English racist rhetoric would raise its ugly head on here. Rule Britannia was actually written by Thomas Arne a Roman Catholic who was proud to be British. He’d get short shrt on the so called Liberal Shetland Islands.The first  notes of Beethoven#s Fth. Lest we forget how Europe became free.And there is a big world out there we don#t need Europepo founded , napoleon long dead by then. liberals to replace lairds  look at tavish family historyThe original company originates from , with the formation of the Peninsular  Oriental Steam Navigation Company, Napolean not long dead . Napoleonic Wars were certainly consequential in the rationale behind the companies formation. Particularly the Peninsular war.It wasn’t of course ever a one way street. Garve, a contemporary of Schiller and Goethe, did a great to broadcast the gains of the Scottish Enlightenment by translating and accrediting the works of Smith, Hume, Ferguson, Hutcheson, Reid and others, to the extent that Goethe himself, though perhaps before his heyday, said there was nowhere in Europe that could hold a candle to what was happening in Scotland. It would be unreasonable to suggest Burns did not become familiar with the thoughts of Kant, Rousseau, Locke, and other European philosophers, directly or indirectly, in the salons of Edinburgh. It would similarly be a nonsense to suggest that Haldane had no exposure to all this. His inspiration cannot be orced from the earlier flourishing of inspirational ideas of brotherhood and equal worth that happily live on yet. Shetland, after the Napoleonic era, seems to have been quite a radical place to a degree, as the later broken-promise legal challenges possibly demonstrate. There was also a legal challenge related to a whale grounding in Sandwick which seemed fairly radical in intent. The underpinning ideas don’t appear to respect the random lines drawn on maps that seem to dominate some people’s thinking.Some lines are more equal than others eh Peter The modern Labour movement of course grew out of the earlier Liberals, with many older ideas and values broadly held in common. Opening the debate, crossbencher, Lord Lisvane saw a problem where Scotland and Northern Ireland, as two of four parts of the United Kingdom, backed Remain, yet could be dragged out of Europe against their will. He identied #a sort of imperial condescension from the centre—from Westminster and Whitehall# and sought #a devolution settlement properly owned by its participants# that would #include something perhaps missing from the present arrangements: the R word—respect.#Most Scots voted to continue their solidarity with Europe, whilst a signicantminority of English and Welsh voters would apparently risk sacricing their older union with Scotland in order to Leave. Schilleradvocated seeking broadminded and warmhearted company. Should the UK falter, will it be those who sought to continue to enjoy the benefits of the wider degree of solidarity who are really to blame I am so sorry, Peter Hamilton, Schiller died two hundred years ago. Have you someone a little more contemporary to bore us with  Tony Benn had some creative thoughts about Europe, as did Jack Jones. They were real socialists and Democrats, not pretentious windbags. Now carry on spouting, Liebe Rosa, will be most impressed. # made me realise how cushioned from the worst excesses of Tory Lib-Dem austerity we are in Scotland: free prescriptions, no bedroom tax and – of vital important to many state benefit recipients – universal credit payment choices, to name but three. This of course, was reflected in Shetland’s EU election result. My friend is planning on early retirement and swt relocation to pro-Europe Shetland.In that same spirit, and reflecting on Northern Ireland’s and Scotland’s situation, I found myself wondering how someone might feeltheir favourite pub, which offers a decent selection of bar meals, was to be burned down by their dour in-laws who run the bog standard cafe next door, all in order to secure wider access to the market.These words were in the context of his apologising to the Roma people for Catholic discrimination.They sit in contrast to Farage’s racist and isive comments regarding Romanians that some people willingly overlook.

By changingthe definition of fuel poverty so it’s more closely aligned to relative incomepoverty and taking steps to ensure it works for remote rural and islandcommunities, we are ensuring our support is focused on those who need it most.”A spokeswoman for Mr Stewart also said that “tacklingand prioritising extreme fuel poverty” – where households have to spend over per cent of their income on heat and light – was the first priority of the newBill. New definitions of both fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty arecurrently being worked on.She added: “Our proposals in the Fuel Poverty Billwill align fuel poverty more closely with low income. Scotland is among only ahandful of European countries to define fuel poverty, let alone set targets relatingto its eradication. Our proposal to use the Minimum Income Standard isimportant and innovative and more closely aligns fuel poverty with low income.The UK Minimum Income Standard, used in the new definition of fuel poverty inthe Fuel Poverty Bill, takes account of the additional costs associated withliving in remote and island communities by applying an uplt for remote ruralareas and remote small towns, and, separately for island areas. The final stageof the Fuel Poverty Bill will be debated by parliament next week.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2108-21-September-12-150x150.jpg","title":"skye director saves the world in good","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIn #Good Omens#, the Amazon Prime debut of Skye-born director Douglas Mackinnon, two key elements stand out — simply because they are outstanding.They are David Tennant and Michael Sheen.

The late Peter McCambridge won his Distinguished Conduct Medal on the Longest Day - but he had, in fact, dropped into Normandy in the late evening of June , .Anyone who has seen the film of The Longest Day will remember the scenes featuring Richard Todd and the Glider troops of the Oxs and Bucks Light Infantry attacking Pegasus Bridge.Mr. McCambridge, then an NCO with the thParachute Btn. of the th Airborne Division, was fighting only yards from this famous action in the nearby village of Le Port.In later years, Peter McCambridge was a familiar figure in Ballymena. He lived at Wilson Crescent and was a keen walker. Few,any, would have known that the tall, bespectacled figure who went about his civilian le so quietly and modestly was one of the heroes of D-Day.This is what his citation recorded about the action:-  Unit : B Company, th Parachute Battalion. Service No. : . Awards : Distinguished Conduct Medal‘This NCO was one of the parachute troops who landed behind the German lines in Normandy on the night th th June . During the fighting for Beacutenouville bridge on the th June, McCambridges platoon was responsible for holding the village of Le Port. At one period his section became detached from the platoon and the fighting, which went on for  hours almost without pause, was particularly fierce. McCambridge noticed that one house dominated the scene of the fighting. By skilful use of a smoke grenade and displaying the greatest dash he got his section across a road swept by Machine Gun fire and into the house. He used anti-tank grenades to smash open the garden gate and the door of the house. Once inside the house he was completely cut off from the rest of his company, who actually had withdrawn slightly, but he was in a dominating position and became the target for the enemy who greatly outnumbered his section and were surrounding him. So well did he dispose his men however and so splendid was his leadership that he held this isolated house until the seaborne troops eventually entered the village from the other end, several hours later. At times the enemy were close enough to try and beat down the door by beating it with their rle butts - McCambridge dealt with such attacks by having grenades dropped on them from the upper windows. There is no doubt that the holding of this dominating house seriously weakened the enemy attacks and greatly assisted the battalion to carry out its job of holding the bridge. On the th June at Bois de Bavent during a company attack Sgt McCambridge, together with another NCO, saved the le of his platoon commander, who had been wounded and whose phosphorus bomb was burning in his pouch. Between them they extracted the burning bomb and dragged the officer to cover despite heavy and accurate mortar and Machine Gun fire.McCambridge has shown himself throughout the three weeks continuous fighting to be a truly magnicent NCO. He is calm, cheerful and always reliable.

Hospitality tickets for a Northern Ireland game, signed shirts from Ulster Rugby and Linfield FC, and signed footballs from Rangers FC and Manchester United, all sold for very respectable sums.However, a titanic bidding war took place over a signed Liverpool FC football and the atmosphere in the room was electric as the figure kept getting higher and higher.When the auctioneer, Mr Fullerton, eventually brought the hammer down and declared ‘sold’, it was Amateurs committee member and local businessman Darren McCauley who became the new owner of the prized football.He might have paid an eye-watering amount, but being a lelong Liverpool fan and a great Dromore clubman, Mr McCauley was delighted with his purchase – and with Liverpool having won the Champions League final at the weekend, it now looks like a clever investment.With the formalities over, it was time for the band to take to the stage, and five-piece Klass proved a big hit, packing the dancefloor until the finish.AwardsThe final act of the   season came on Saturday, May  with a charity match between current players and a team of Amateurs “legends”.An entertaining game was played in a friendly but competitive spirit at the Community Centre.The youthful legs of the current players proved too much for the wise old heads of the legends. However, a clever tactical decision to play the last  minutes with  players on the pitch helped the old boys finish the game with a respectable - defeat.It was wonderful to see so many former players come along, pull the boots on and attempt to relive past glories. Special mention goes to Malcolm Hanna, who celebrated his th birthday with a sterling display in midfield.A total of £ was raised for Diabetes UK, with the costs of the day kindly sponsored by Trevor Tate and Son Transport Ltd.Afterwards, the Amateurs held their end-of-season awards presentation in the clubrooms.Chairman Russell Ward expressed his sincere thanks to the coaching staff, players and committee for all their efforts throughout the season.First team player-manager Graeme Davis was praised for guiding the Amateurs to their highest place league finish in many years.Dromore ended the season in fth positionin the Intermediate B Division of the Mid Ulster Football League.Their record was as follows: P W D L Pts .Graeme can be proud of this achievement in his debut season in charge.

These two fantastic athletes will be the backbone of the first team for many years to come.Young player of the year was Matthew Briggs, who moved up from youth football and played the entire season in the first team - a tremendous achievement.In the seconds, top goalscorer Jonathan Rodgers only joined midway through the season but he is a great attacking player and is such an exciting prospect.

If we get Boris Johnson in as Prime Minister, God knows what’s going to happen because that man wants to bring in an amnesty. He will probably call a halt to legacy inquests, so we need to get people out on the streets at the weekend.”She continued: “The inquest won’t answer all of our questions, but at least we’re having it addressed. We had General Mike Jackson in the box who, when my brother and Mr Corr were being thrown into the back of an army vehicle, he stood round the corner saying they had engaged in two-three hour gun battle and had shot dead two gunmen. That has now been exposed – they were unarmed.“We’re  years down the line with our campaign. An inquest is something that every person is entitled to. The right to le is something that people should have in any country.”Mr Laverty’s niece, Mary-Kate Quinn, added: “The Stormont House Agreement was something that people were happy with, but all of the mechanisms are shelved. Sunday is about making sure there is a process for everybody to be involved in and asking for it to be implemented.“The Stormont House Agreement provides people with mechanisms that acknowledge their loved ones. There are people sitting who don’t even know that they have had loved ones murdered – they have no voice.We’re very lucky –you could say that – that we have a process and we’re miles ahead of everybody  because of the inquest.”She continued: “The Ballymurphy campaign and the inquest has given people hope. As a family we would like to think that it gives people hope. When the Bloody Sunday families got the outcome of their investigation it was victory for them, but it was a victory for all of us. I think this march is about hope and about demanding the rights that we’re entitled to.”The Time for Truth March will assemble at pm, Sunday th June at three points, walking to join at Belfast City Hall.

This is the case up until he witnesses the hatred and bigotry directed towards Irish supporters of the now infamous and most politically -charged match between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland during the  World Cup qualier at Windsor Park.The toxic atmosphere which rained down from the stands was captured in Marie’s prose the match comingjust days after the Shankill bombing and the Greysteel murders.The Fall and Come Home actor Matthew Forsythe fought off  submissions,  self-tapes and “ people in the room which was then whittled down to ,” for the “dream role” of playing Kenneth.“I read it around  and it was and is one of those theatre pieces that I instantly felt a connection with. I saw a lot of me in the part especially growing up in the s and s.”The play on its first initial run was a showcase for actor Dan Gordon who portrayed Kenneth, and later Marty Maguire who toured the production around the States. Matthew explained how when he was trying to get into drama school across the water he contacted Dan for advice and support.“I was holding a charity event to try and raise a bit of money, Dan couldn’t come but he sent me a postcard with a £ cheque in it and the postcard was of Dan in character as Kenneth. I still have it,” he said.Matthew’s further connection to the piece was that he was in the Windsor stands that ‘night in November’having been taken to see the match with his school, Laurelhill High School in Lisburn.In August  Patrick Kielty took on the role of Kenneth, directed by acclaimed actor Ian McElhinney during a run at the Opera House. Fast-forward  years and its Ian and Marie’s son Matthew now in the director’s chair.“The play debuted during a very sensitive, political time,” explained Matthew McElhinney, “the reaction was very funny, very moving and very engaging. There was some controversy over the content, it was seen as being not painting the side of the community my mother came from in the best light, essentially it was a critique of her own community, her own people. Mum was writing about what she saw at the time. Such was its reaction the Lyric had to put on extra security.”Asked about the signicance of the play  years on Matthew spoke of how the play “paints the two sides of football”.“I remember there was talk of bringing the play back to the stage during the Euro’s but mum said it wasn’t the right time.  years is a big anniversary and I kept thinking ‘how am I going to stage this ’ To frame it within the context of that was then, this is now. There has been astounding progress from the ‘Billy Boys’ to being awarded the Grand Vermeil in  during the Euros, for the Northern Ireland fans along with the Republic. It’s a chance to say look at what we have achieved, and the tagline of the play is ‘is it possible to change ’“The play has ups, downs, laughs and emotion. It’s been  years and we are about to have a whole new generation come to see it.”A Night in November runs at the Lyric Theatre from June -.

The two committees are carrying out an inquiry in the welfare system in Northern Ireland.I was being assessed but I felt I was being interrogatedPIP claimant JohnHe said he has suffered from mental health problems for  years since the death of his son, also called John, only five days after he was born.John, who said he was prescribed medication for anxiety after the assessment, said the outcome will see his benefits potentially cut by £ a month from next March.“I had to relive every single thing from the day and hour my child was born until he died, his name was John, and I had to go through the funeral arrangement that I done,” he said.“I was left that I had to walk out of that door after two hours with no support whatsoever.“I was being assessed but I felt I was being interrogated.”He added: “I don’t want to see anybody  go through with I went through.“I know what it done to me and it very nearly ended up where I was back in hospital again and I contemplated taking my own le.”SNP MP Chris Stephens was scathing in regard to Capita.“I will be calling them ‘Crapita’ for the purposes of this discussion,” he said.Another benefit claimant, George from Carrickfergus, spoke about his fears of losing his Housing Executive homethe “bedroom tax” starts to operate in the absence of Stormont mitigation payments next March.“I have lived in a house for  years, brought up a family – four children – they have grown up and left and my we’s gone now and I am in the house on my own and it’s a house full of memories and when the bedroom tax comes in I will be put out, just put of my home,” he said.“It will be a big challenge at my age, I am  years old and to be moved out of what was my le, what is my le, and to be put where someone  wants me to live.”George, who would face being penalised for two of the three bedrooms in his house, questioned whether there would be a suitable one bedroom apartment for him to live in in Carrick.“Are they talking about moving me not only out of my home but out of my town where I was born, my mother was born, her mother was born ,” he asked.“I have four children and they come and stay with me andthey move me to a one bedroom apartment anywhere I can’t have my children come to stay with me, where would I put them  So I am losing my family, not just my home.“It isn’t just a house to me, it’s a home and it has been for  years and all the memories that go with it. It’s very insensitive.”DUP MP Ian Paisley noted that only % of the Housing Executive stock in Northern Ireland was one bedroom accommodation.“There isn’t enough houses to go round in your circumstances,” he told George.“You are looking down the barrel of a gun – that is just terrible.”A Capita spokeswoman said: “All our assessors are healthcare professionals, equipped with the training, skills and knowledge to carry out assessments across Northern Ireland in a professional and empathetic manner, in line with DfC guidance. “The PIP assessment gathers factual information about a person’s al capability, and does not seek to reach a diagnosis.

It is thought a new prime minister could be in place on the week beginning July .SDLP leader Colum Eastwood described their proposals for the backstop as fantasy.How the Irish border operates has dogged the Brexit talks. Theresa Mays negotiated backstop has caused consternation in Parliament with many saying it risks the integrity of the United Kingdom. Her persistence in trying to get her deal through with the backstop ultimately led to her downfall.“Just when you think you’ve heard it all, another Tory Leadership hopeful blunders into the Brexit border debate with proposals that range from ridiculous to insulting,\" said Colum Eastwood. Boris Johnson - who once told the DUP party conference the UK must \"junk the backstop\" - before he voted for Theresa Mays withdrawal agreement told the Sunday Times he would scrap the backstop and only discuss border arrangements in the future trade talks.He has said the UK should leave the EU on October , with or without a deal, and would withhold the so-called £billion orce payment until a better deal could be struck.The Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who has moved into contention as a front runner alongside Boris Johnson, has said he would look to renegotiate a new deal with Brussels, claiming he has had assurances from German Chancellor Angela Merkel. However, the EU has repeatedly said it will notto talks and considers the negotiations on the UKs exit as completed.\"They understand that the backstop is not going to get through Parliament,\" said Hunt at his leadership bid launch.Environment Secretary Michael Gove is battling to stay in the contest after his admission of cocaine use  years ago led to calls to withdraw. data-dfpadtargeting former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, International Development Secretary Rory Stewart, former Conservative chief whip Mark Harper, Home Secretary Sajid Javid,former work and pensions secretary Esther McVey, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, former House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, and Sam Gyimah \" former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, International Development Secretary Rory Stewart, former Conservative chief whip Mark Harper, Home Secretary Sajid Javid,former work and pensions secretary Esther McVey, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, former House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, and Sam Gyimah \" title\"Contenders in the Conservative leadership raceformer foreign secretary Boris Johnson, former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, International Development Secretary Rory Stewart, former Conservative chief whip Mark Harper, Home Secretary Sajid Javid,former work and pensions secretary Esther McVey, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, former House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, and Sam Gyimah \" width\"\" \"\"   former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, International Development Secretary Rory Stewart, former Conservative chief whip Mark Harper, Home Secretary Sajid Javid,former work and pensions secretary Esther McVey, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, former House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, and Sam Gyimah \" title\"Contenders in the Conservative leadership raceformer foreign secretary Boris Johnson, former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, International Development Secretary Rory Stewart, former Conservative chief whip Mark Harper, Home Secretary Sajid Javid,former work and pensions secretary Esther McVey, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, former House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, and Sam Gyimah \" width\"\" \"\"  Contenders in the Conservative leadership raceformer foreign secretary Boris Johnson, former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, International Development Secretary Rory Stewart, former Conservative chief whip Mark Harper, Home Secretary Sajid Javid,former work and pensions secretary Esther McVey, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, former House of Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, and Sam Gyimah He told the BBC Andrew Marr show he wanted to see a \"full stop to the backstop\" and that he favoured the so-called Stormont lock which would allow Northern Ireland politicians to have their say on how the backstop would operate should it ever come into being with any law changes it makes followed by the rest of the UK.Sajid Javid said the UK had a \"moral duty\" to pay for border arrangements pledging to offer £million for technological solutions.He insisted his time as home secretary - which includes responsibilities for the UKs borders - had shown it was possible to have an invisible border between the Republic and Northern Ireland saying he had \"done the homework on this\".“You don’t need a magic solution for this. The solution exists,\" he told Sky News. “I will change the dynamic and I will do that by offering the money to pay for the border. It is justied that we do that because, economically,that unlocks a deal we will have a mini economic boom in this countrywe get a deal and that will pay for that,” he said.Colum Eastwood described Javids offer of money as \"crass, amateur and really offensive\".\"The notion that Britain can slip Ireland £m for our trouble and think we’ll agree, presumably with a nod and a wink, to say no more is crass and amateur. It amounts to diplomatic bribery and solves absolutely nothing.\"Dominic Raab at his launch to become the next Tory leader vowed toto Brussels to make a \"best final offer\" to replace the controversial backstop. Former work and pensions secretary Esther McVey told Sky News the technology existed to facilitate an \"invisible border\" which could be in place by October . A claim that has been disputed by - among others - Brussels officials. Rory Stewart has said there is \"not a hope\" of renegotiating a new deal or getting rid of the backstop before October , the new date for the UK to leave the EU.“Whoever the next British Prime Minister needs to get real very quickly,\" continued Eastwood. \"There is no deal on the table that doesn’t involve the backstop or remaining within the single market and customs union. \"The alternative is a crash out Brexit which would be a disaster for these islands. Playing to the Tory party gallery during a leadership challenge is all well and good but people on this island will not be taken for granted or bought off.”"},{"url":null,"title":"lyra mckee book to go on presale","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

We will support Ireland’s fishing boats.”John O’Kane from Foyle Fishermans Co-Operative Society said three vessels are fishing in the disputed area and have no plans to cut short their trip, and when they , will head back to Rockall despite the warnings from the Scottish government.The boats are small family fishing businesses with six to eight staff aboard fishing mainly for haddock, monkfish and squid.“This announcement came totally out of the blue and we were unaware about any notication to the Irish government prior to that,” Mr O’Kane said.“There’s a bit of diplomacy going on at the minute, and we’re hoping that resolves it, but at this minute in time, we’ve not had any word from anyone in the Irish government.“Our boats have been fishing there since January, its a very sustainable fishery, it’s rich fishing ground, and our boats have fished there for over  years.“The last thing we want is a Scottish patrol vessel making arrests, taking people ashore. You lose time, you have the expense, a court case, a fine and the repercussions of whether to go back to fish from that area.“This is our business, we need as much fish coming in as possible, we have markets to supply, and everyone on the boats, the crew to the skipper, to the locals who work on the pier, we’re all reliant on these boats continuing to fish.“There’s many families in the local Donegal area dependent on whitefish vessels fishing at Rockall.“Everything from the local shop, to the welder, to the boatbuilder, they’re all reliant on this industry.”A Scottish government spokeswoman said: “Irish vessels or any non-UK vessels for that matter have never been allowed to fish in this way in the UK’s territorial sea around Rockall and, despite undertaking extensive discussions with the Irish authorities on the matter, it is disappointing that this activity continues.“There has actually been an increase in that illegal activity and, with the Rockall fishery season nearly upon us, it is our duty and obligation to defend the interests of Scottish fisheries and ensure compliance with well-established international law.”The Scottish government first raised the issue of access to the area around Rockall in , according to the Irish government."},{"url":null,"title":"oops sinn fein press advisor accidentally sends mass email asking about redundancy","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The party lost  seats on local authorities around the country last week, and at least one MEP.Ms McDonald has accepted responsibility for the result, telling reporters: “The buck stops with me.” The result has sparked fears within Sinn Fein that the party will lose some of its  Dail seats at the next general election.Mr Treacy was a late substitute onto the party’s election ticket for Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.He secured just  votes in the Glencullen-Sandyford ward."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38184574.ece/804a7/BINARY/trump_shannon_002.jpg","title":"the donald gets into the swing of things after landing in rough with border faux pas","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Were used to Americans coming over and flattering the Irish with faux praise about how their ancestors built their country. Trump is somewhat dferent, though.Sources say the US President told Taoiseach Leo Varadkar that he always thinks of the Republic as \"a huge country\" because of the impact its people have had. Varadkar happily told him the country has just five million people.It was one of the lighter moments in a meeting that briskly moved from serious topics to sport. Brexit, immigration and all featured, before conversation swayed to The Open. At one point the Irish side found itself explaining how, for some sports, the whole island plays as one team, while for others, there are Republic and Northern Ireland teams. The US President was fascinated. Insiders say the atmosphere was \"warm\", which probably matched the temperature in the makesht meeting room that was dressed up with a few net curtains and colourful flowers. On the American side, Trump had some big hitters, but they didnt throw any punches. There was his Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, National Security Advisor John Bolton and Secretary of the Treasury Steve Mnuchin. Varadkars back-up team included his Chief of Staff, Brian Murphy, main Brexit brain John Callinan, US envoy John Deasy and Ambassador Dan Mulhall. Even before the meeting began, it was obvious Trump was in a good mood. He allowed journalists to fire questions at him for eight minutes without trading any insults. He also denied being in Ireland to play golf and promote his hotel but struggled to show that he had done any actual preparation for the meeting. The Taoiseach was brave enough to publicly correct him when he tried to compare the Irish border situation with his plans to build a wall between the US and Mexico. \"His basic knowledge isnt great,\" a source admitted. However, Mr Varadkar insisted afterwards that the purpose of the meeting was to educate the US delegation.Soon, Trump and his we, Melania, were on board a chopper bound for Doonbeg. Irish officials were more than a little relieved. Mr Varadkar went on to defend the cost of providing , unormed and  specialist gardai for the trip. \"The good bilateral relationship between Ireland and America is worth a lot more than €m,\" he said. Trump is unlikely to have taken in much of what was said, but he didnt call anybody, including Michael D Higgins, a stone cold loser. No real damage done, then, which is the best they could have hoped for. There was no mention of wind turbines or fake news. \"I learn from my mistakes,\" the Taoiseach laughed as he left the post-match analysis session.  data-dfpadtargeting and First Lady Melania Trumpdisembark Air Force One upon arrival at Shannon Airport in Shannon, County Clare, Ireland on June , .

obesity epidemic  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council is aiming to help fight the growing obesity crisis across Northern Ireland.Local politicians are gearing up to declare war on the issue and implement a new policy that will result in high sugar items such as sweets, fizzy drinks and high fat snacks being banned from vending machines in council buildings across the district, including its leisure centres.The high sugar items will be replaced with healthy choice snacks and drinks with local politicians hoping that other organisations across the district, which have vending machines in their buildings, will follow suit.A number of local schools have already banned chocolates and crisps from their vending machines with politicians keen to lead from the front in encouraging people to eat more healthily and exercise regularly.Last year, the local authority launched a new app to make it easier for residents across the district to take part in sport and leisure activities and receive up-to-date information about the local authorityrsquos leisure facilities.Now it wants to go a step further to help improve peoplersquos health.The move to ban high fat and sugary items from vending machines across council buildings, which will be formally discussed later this month, comes after it emerged this week that sweets, crisps and fizzy drinks could soon be sold under cigarette-style plain packaging under plans by a number of leading brands to help combat the obesity epidemic.A recent Department of Health survey revealed that that % of people in Northern Ireland were overweight, with % classed as obese with councillors acutely aware that obesity continues to be one of the most important public health challenges.They recognise that being overweight or obese increases the risk of le threatening disease, with its costs extending far beyond the public sector, affecting iniduals, families, communities, the economy and society as a whole.At Monday nightrsquos monthly meeting of the local authority, politicians agreed to debate the possible ban and view the move as an important step towards tacking the obesity issue.They aim to encourage people to opt for healthier food choices and to change their diet as part of the drive to create an environment that supports and promotes a physically active lestyle and healthy diet.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke, who is spearheading the drive to ban sugary snacks and drinks from council vending machines, said he hopes it will empower people to make healthier choices and reduce the risk of overweight and obesity related diseases.He said tackling childhood obesity was already a public health priority and was keen for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to do all it could at a time when research suggested that one in four children across the island of Ireland carried excess weight.Cllr Clarke said that without action to reverse current trends, the next generation will be beset with signicant ill-health related issues linked to obesity, most of which are potentially preventable.ldquoI am keen for the local council to introduce a new policy to effectively ban high fat and sugary foods and drinks from vending machines across its facilities and replace them with healthy options, he explained.ldquoI also hope that the local authorityrsquos many partner organisations will follow suit. We do not want to see obesity becoming a social norm and I believe we can help make a dference by exercising greater control over what items are in vending machines in all council buildings.Cllr Clarke said he viewed a ban on sugary snacks and drinks as ldquojust the start of a concerted campaign to help tackle obesity and get people move towards healthier lestyles.ldquoI think it is important that the council takes the lead on an issue which everyone can support. It is essential people signicantly reduce their intake of unhealthy food and drinks, he said.The local councillor also suggested that the local authority should offer politicians healthy options when they arrive for their tea ahead of the monthly council meetings.ldquoHealthy options featuring salads, fruit and vegetables should also be on the menu at council-organised s so people can choose to eat healthily. While I want the council to take the lead on this issue, I hope many other bodies it works alongside will follow suit.ldquoWorking together we can make a dference and help people change their lives. The councilrsquos lead on this issue could have a ripple effect across the district beyond.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoThis is not about being a kill joy but encouraging people to be more health conscious when it comes to what they eat and drink and is the first step in a process..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Countdown to DownTime summer festival  ","story":"THE countdown is on for this monthrsquos spectacular DownTime summer festival which has something for everyone.Organisers of the four-day community event mdash which kicks off on June  mdash are promising a sparkling festival of fun which includes two daysrsquo of not-to-be-missed horse racing at the widely acclaimed Downpatrick track.Horse racing first took place at in Downpatrick in  and for almost  years the local track has been constantly improving, boasting great racing, modern facilities, themed race days and a rather unique atmosphere.DownTime summerfest has been organised by a dedicated local team from all sectors of the community whose aim is to get people out and about not just over the four-day festival, but across the summer.Now in its second year, the festival is supported by Newry, Mourne and Down Council and features over  events covering arts, heritage, music, food and, of course, sport.There will be street art, live music, theatre performances, free train rides, a living history Viking encampment at the St Patrick Centre and an artisan market mdash which will be open between am and .pm mdash cradled in the grounds of the Down County Museum.Locals and visitors alike will experience a haven of freshly produced food, bespoke crafts and relaxing surroundings.

Apart from a host of blister complaints, the bulk of real casualties were a handful of people taken to Downe Hospital suffering from heat exhaustion.One woman suffering from exhaustion had to be taken by an RAF helicopter to the Red Cross mobile treatment room and a man, who was knocked unconscious when a small boulder struck him on the head, was also taken to hospital.Despite minor upsets, the whole day was a big success story.

With winter over, during which time many elderly residents were effectively trapped in their homes after dark, the news may not be much consolation for residents.The committee also heard that their plea for a telephone kiosk at Cuan Beach had been refused and that an alternative site has been found for the Toye Kiosk at the New Line.ANNSBOROUGH mdash The youngsters of Annsborough have at last been able to use their new playing fields where a mix-up in the erection of a fence had kept them out for several months. Grazing cattle which have been using the field have been banished to the sidelines behind a new fence.The problem started when Enterprise Ulster erected only one fence at the new playground and forgot about s second fence to keep out nearby cattle.

The traditional merchant city is situated on the lsquoRiver of Goldrsquo. It was here in the th century that Portugal took its name. Much of its fine architecture in the old medieval quarter and a mandatory wine tasting session of the world famous ruby-port wine warrant atrip in itself some day.Hugging the coastline, this first stage meanders along a low lying shoreline of boardwalks and sand dunes to Vila do Conde where we took lodging for the night in a guest house as the townrsquos albergue offered only mattresses in a hallway.Day two saw us slowly begin to adapt to the rigours and demands of the Camino. I secretly longed for the day to be over before it began and was relieved that not just a few of us were wondering the same thing. Yet,  miles later, with a one and a half stone weight packed inside our rucksacks and the unwelcome emergence of a cluster of painful blisters forming, we were singing with joy as we arrived at the popular surfing resort of Esposende in the Braga district later that afternoon.Day three began in much the same way, neither of us forgetting the miracle cure that can be derived from a good nightrsquos sleep. We crossed the Rio Nieve to the first of two  foot peaks leading to Viana do Castelo where the majestic Monte Santa Luzia stands atop of a steep hill overlooking yet another captivating beachside town.Half way between Esposende and Viana do Castelo is Igreja Santiago de Castelo do Neiva, where an altar inion relating to St James and dated  AD was found during the reconstruction of the church. This is the oldest consecration to the apostle to be found outside Spain and has put this relatively recent route firmly on the official routes map for pilgrims.Onwards we hiked to Caminha on day four, where more beach board walks, pebbled pathways and sand dunes morphed into woodland trails, offering welcoming shade from the midday sun. Another steady uphill climb helped us reach here before crossing the Spanish-Portuguese border the next day.Farmers still tend their crops by hand in this part of the world, which harks back to a bygone era, leaving it untouched by modern intensive farming methods and giving us a window on the past.The fth leg of our journey began by being ferried across the border in a row boat which had a small motor installed, leaving behind the harbour town of Caminha for the Spanish town of Garda a few short miles round the bay.Further up the coast we trekked, for -and a-half miles until we reached the quaint seaside hamlet of Oia and its famous Cistercian monastery, Real Monasterio de Oia, which dates back to .By this stage our trek was getting easier as we adapted to the distances we were hiking each day. By way of a measuring stick as to how far wersquod come, we got chatting to a couple from Kent who had made their way to a villa they had rented out for a short break.They had driven from Porto in a hired car up the motorway the day before and it took them  minutes. It had taken us five gruelling, but extraordinarily peaceful days to reach the same point and we laughed at how easy it could have been.Each day we handed over our pilgrim passport to be stamped by church sacristans, post office workers, tourist office clerks, cafe and hostel owners, each of them eager to put their mark on our pilgrim way as we followed another hand-painted yellow arrow or scallop shell, dutully painted and maintained by locals proud to be part of a , year-old Christian pilgrimage, which has exploded in popularity in recent years not only with Christians, but also with the unbeliever, the doubter, the atheist and the sceptic mdash all eager to take on its challenges in a bid to escape the rigours and stress of modern day le.Each day too locals seemed to appear out of the midsts, asby magic, beckoning us with a whistle or a car horn to prompt us to turn aroundwe had mistakenly taken a wrong route mdash for which we were very grateful because each step we took seemed to matter a great deal.On day six the town of Moughas gave way to the mountain village Baiona, from where we walked to Ramallosa, famed for its historic sites and narrow medieval streets.Day seven presented a continuous series of spectacular vistas, each imprinted upon our minds until the day we die, such was their beauty, until we reached the large city of Vigo.Between Ramallosa and Vigo we met with a retired local man out walking his dog along the seashore. Silently he studied the two of us slouched exhausted over a park bench at mid morning. We could almost hear the mechanisms at play within his mind.ldquoWhere are you from  he enquired in a fair attempt at English.ldquoNorthern Ireland, we both replied, knowing that he was going to say something witty.ldquoAh, Paddies, he said, aswaiting our next move in a chess game.Ah, you must be Pedro, we retorted, intending no harm.ldquoWhere are you walking to  he enquired.ldquoSantiago de Compostela in Galacia, we both said.It was a trigger. After telling us quite succinctly what, over the last several decades, he had slowly come to realise le was about and how it should be lived, he asked: ldquoWhy are you doing it Neither of us was prepared for his directness but I showed him my rosary beads nonetheless. ldquoItrsquos a sacrice, I said straight out. He paused before he shook his head and said: ldquoYoursquoll never make it.As he watched us stand up he was only too eager though to hold our rucksacks as we reached into them again after our short but thought provoking rest.After wishing us buen Camino, he asked us to remember him when we reached the tomb of St James.Day eight and the noise and bustle of Vigo soon gave way to  feet and a steady climb of mountainous terrain and shady woodland trekking until we reached the refreshingly rural town of Redondela.Quiet country lanes led to  miles of more pebbled rustic pathways and stony gravel lanes on day nine until we reached the city of Pontevedra. As good fortune would have it, Friday, May , was a public holiday across Galacia and every shop, except cafes and wine bars were closed. We did mange to explore the magnicent Roman town though in the evening, but our bank balance didnrsquot suffer too much.Pontevedra paved the way on day ten with more forest trails and waterfalls. Our first climb of the day was to Caldas de Reis, home of the famous volcanic foot spa where for centuries pilgrims have been dipping their sore and weary feet in water of  degrees.Our penultimate day saw us take on the dizzy heights of Mount Corgullion before reaching the famous city of Padron, where we sampled the world famous padron peppers with dinner in the evening.Padron is  miles south of Santiago and is the starting point of St Jamesrsquos ministry in Spain and to where his remains were brought following his martyrdom in Jerusalem. His remains were later taken to the cathedral in Santiago where they lie in a tomb.We gazed in awe at the great Jacobean treasure and the original stone mooring post of Padron, from which the town gets its name.On the twelfth day a final temptation presented itself in the form of a train station that was situated directly opposite our lodgings that evening. Fellow pilgrims laughed at the idea that a train would take us to Santiago in  pain-free minutes,we werenrsquot up to the final trek and the almost , feet climb.I wasnrsquot laughing. I seriously eyed up the possibility, going as far to check train times. It was a stroke of good luck when I learned there was no other half way stop between Padron and Santiago. After what we had endured over the last  days, not to walk the final few miles would have been an obvious regret.And so we reached Santiago on foot shortly after pm on May , overjoyed and in a state of euphoria. The city of Santiago was worth the hike. Itrsquos as beautul and charming as it is captivating.The camaraderie and craic shared among all us pilgrims who made it from Porto to Santiago that day was incomparable to anything I have encountered before. The memories will stay with me until the day I die..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9893171.jpg","title":"line up of calves win over judges at calf fair","story":"Breed judges from throughout the UK and Ireland were unanimous in their praise for the Pedigree Calf Fair and Beef NI Expo, held at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on SaturdaySpeaking after the one-day show, which featured three show rings and  native and continental beef breeds, event organiser and Chairman, David Connolly said: ldquoItrsquos been another fantastic event, and we certainly exceeded our strap-line lsquoBigger and Betterrsquo.ldquoThe  show has surpassed last yearrsquos inaugural event, attracting hundreds of spectators and more than  trade exhibits.

However, after a review, the concession will now be available only to households receiving Pension Credit.The BBC said it had put ldquofairness and supporting those most in need at the heart of its decision, but the move has been criticised by Eddie Lynch, the Commissioner for Older People for Northern Ireland, and many others including Prime Minister Theresa May..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog Warning that older people who rely on TV for companionship will have found todayrsquos announcement ldquodistressing, Mr Lynch said: ldquoThis is really disappointing news which will affect over , people over the age of  living in Northern Ireland. ldquoItrsquos my view that both the Government and the BBC have let down over-s in the UK by failing to find a way to continue funding this concession, especially given the fact that they had four years to come up with a solution to mitigate cost or consider other sources of income.He continued: ldquoFor many older people, TV is a leline and often a source of companionship and comfort. People over  are more likely to be living alone, living with a disability and have fewer opportunities to remedy the causes of isolation and loneliness. Itrsquos becoming increasingly acknowledged the impact that loneliness has on peoplersquos health ndash the effects of loneliness can be as harmful as smoking  cigarettes a day.ldquoAs a society, we canrsquot keep talking about supporting our older population and then make decisions that negatively impact them. I feel disappointed today for many older people who will no doubt find this news distressing.Eithne Gilligan, head of policy and engagement at Age NI, said: ldquoWe are deeply disappointed with the decision made by the BBC to opt for means testing and to ask older people to self-declarethey receive Pension Credit in order to receive the TV licence fee concession. This decision will mean that hundreds of pensioners will face a new annual bill they simply canrsquot afford because, although eligible for Pension Credit, they donrsquot actually get it.\"We know from speaking to older people in Northern Ireland that the BBCrsquos decision will cause great anxiety and distress to those who rely on TV for companionship, their connection to the world beyond their home and to reducing loneliness.\"In an Age NI survey over a thirdof people aged  years and over agreed that TV was their main form of company. Older people spoke about the importance of TV to their wellbeing and described it as a leline.\"There will also be some anger too at the decision made by the BBC but in the end this is the responsibility of the UK Government. We hope that the new Prime Minister will intervene and provide sufficient funding to continue the concession until the BBCrsquos overall funding deal comes up for negotiation in .North Antrim MP Ian Paisley Jnr branded the BBCrsquos decision ldquoa disgrace and accused the broadcaster of ldquotaking the easy option and ldquoburdening pensioners with additional cost.Calls in parliament for Northamptonshire County Council leader to go Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"ldquoPassing this cost on to pensioners will not solve the real long-term issues facing the BBC however that the licence fee itself is an anachronism in the modern broadcasting landscape, he said. ldquoThe Government should fund this concession until , butthe BBC are determined to press ahead then it must be monitored closely by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. The BBC must be held properly to account for the decisions they are taking and the impact it will have on many people who can ill-afford this extra financial burden.According to her official spokesman, Prime Minister Theresa May was ldquovery disappointed with the BBCrsquos decision and has urged it to look again at ways of supporting older people.It is thought . million households will be eligible for the free licence under the new scheme, which will cost the BBC around £ million by   depending on the take-up.Licence fees were being reviewed by the BBC, with the full cost of concession due to be passed to the corporation from government in June .Facing financial pressures and attempting to streamline, the BBC has said previously that shouldering the burden of free licences would ldquofundamentally change the broadcaster.The threat of scrapping the free licence drew criticism from campaigners who stressed its importance for the elderly.Eamonn Donaghy, chief executive of Age Sector Platform - the charity responsible for the Northern Ireland Pensioners Parliament - said he and his colleagues understand the economics of the problem facing the BBC, but said the Government should step in and take the scheme back into its control.ldquoThey are creating a situation that could have an adverse impact on an awful lot of older people. We believe that the concession should remain and it should be government funded as it was previously, he said.Chairman of the BBC Sir David Clementi said: ldquoLinking a free licence for over-s to Pension Credit was the leading reform option. It protects the poorest over-s, while protecting the services that they, and all audiences, love.ldquoIt is the fairest and best outcome. It is one we can implement and endorse. This is an outcome that is the fairest possible in dficult circumstances.TV Licensing has advised customers currently receiving a free licence that they do not need to take any immediate action and that ldquothey will be supported through the changes when the current arrangement for free over  licences paid for by the UK government comes to an end next year.TV Licensing said it will be launching a free telephone information line this month where older customers and their relatives can access recorded information on the new policy and advice by calling   .Information and frequently asked questions can also be found on the TV Licensing website ndash tvl agetry catch  TrendingMOT delays: PSNI in talks about relaxing rules for affected driversN.I.

The PSNI will not make such a decision in isolation.”Asked what advice police could give to motorists faced with long delays for an appointment, the PSNI said: “Keep checking the online booking portal for cancellations. Carry your appointment letter with you.”Charlene out to strike a gender balance in the music industry\"  \"  Reported On This Day : Murdering Irish peer is pardoned by King George II Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Cousens said: “If not quickly resolved, lawful drivers could be unfairly penalised for an issue outside of their control.“It’s not just the private motorist at risk either, as delivery vans are being caught up in the backlog. As the majority of freight is moved by road, inaction could dent the Northern Irish economy.“In previous periods of delay, Stormont has allowed exemptions to affected vehicles while the backlog is cleared. We hope that this can be repeated again while a long-term solution is sought.”Almost , more tests than normal were made in the first three months of this year.The Department of Infrastructure has said additional staff are being recruited and “urgent consideration” is being given to the possibility of opening testing centres on Sundays for a limited period of time in order to address the current backlog.try catch  TrendingMOT delays: PSNI in talks about relaxing rules for affected driversIncreasing concern for N.I. teen who has vanishedSinger Malachi Cush lsquostablersquo in RVH following road collisionN.I.

I know you have before and I know you may not believe in your heart that you can do it, but the Conservative Party membership deserve a choice.”He also vowed to never use the tax and benefits system to “give the already wealthy another tax cut” - in an apparent dig at Mr Johnson, who has signalled a plan to slash the higher rate of income tax for people earning more than £,..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog Mr Gove insisted he was in the race to win it despite calls for him to withdraw over his cocaine admission, which cast a shadow over his campaign launch on Monday.Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt’s campaign was bolstered by the backing of two Cabinet ministers, influential Remain supporter Amber Rudd and prominent Brexiteer Penny Mordaunt.Mr Hunt positioned himself as a “serious leader” and warned that the Tories would be “annihilated”they fight a general election before delivering Brexit.Other contenders, including Andrea Leadsom, Sajid Javid, Rory Stewart, Mark Harper and Mr Johnson, are expected to launch their campaigns later this week.The MPs – who each had the backing of at least eight of their colleagues – will need at least  votes to get through the first ballot on Thursday - while the candidate with the lowest votes will be eliminated.Health Secretary Matt Hancock pledged to increase the national living wage to more than £ an hour, and said he would reduce taxes on working people “when we can afford it”.Former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab spelled out his desire to break from the EU by October  even without a dealnecessary, and called for a “generational change in leadership”.While Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey promised public sector workers a pay rise and vowed to increase police spending and boost funding for education as she set out her vision for the country.She told the Eurosceptic Bruges Group: “My clear agenda is to deliver Brexit on the st of October and then we must unite the country, and then unite our party too.”Declan Morgan interview: ‘It wasn’t that Catholics lacked faith in the justice system, it was more a lack of engagement’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The  declared candidates became  just before the announcement as former minister Sam Gyimah said it had been a “tremendous privilege” to be able to make the case for a second referendum in the campaign, but had reached the conclusion that “there simply has not been enough time to build sufficient support, and I have decided to step back”.“My purpose in campaigning for a solution to break the deadlock, and bringing new ideas to help my party win over modern Britain, will not change,” he said in a statement.“I wish all the contenders the very best at this challenging time as they make the case to take our country forward.”try catch  TrendingMOT delays: PSNI in talks about relaxing rules for affected driversN.I.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

My own view on moving forward is that a final say Peoplersquos Vote on any Brexit deal is the best option.It was a really positive event, and thank you to all constituents who attended. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The Glasson cow calved in February and is currently giving  litres of milk per day at .% butterfat and .% protein.“She is a tremendously well-bred animal,” Simon Haffey confirmed.“Our plan is to take embryos from her later in the year.”There was a tremendous turnout of dairy stock, across the board, at this year’s Armagh Show. The same could also be said for the number of visitors coming through the gates of Gosford Forest park, the now traditional venue of the event. Frequent heavy showers failed to dampen the enthusiasm and enjoyment of everyone taking part in what has now become a blue-ribbon event in the Co Armagh calendar. Meanwhile, in the beef cattle rings, the Matchett family, from the Birches in north Co Armagh, were having an equally successful day. Their two-year-old Charolais heer Summervilla Niki won the Beef Inter Breed Championship. She beat off the stf opposition posed by the majestic Limousin bull, shown by the Crawford family from Co Fermanagh.Niki was bred by Co Roscommon breeder Ciaran O’Donnell.“She is confirmed in calf to Allenford Vagabond,” Gail Matchett explained.“He is quite an old bull now but is an extremely easy calving sire. We currently have six pedigree Charolais females in the herd. We plan to grow this number for the future.” This year’s Armagh Show was also marked by the confirmation from the PSNI that rural crime has reduced signicantly across Northern Ireland. Inspector Kieran Quinn, who is based in Armagh city, attended the event. He said: “Rural crime figures have fallen by % over the past number of years.Police have a deflating experience Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“This is a very encouraging figure and reflects the efforts farmers are taking to prevent crimes from taking place in the first place.”He added: “There are  PSNI officers operating in the Banbridge, Armagh, and Craigavon areas. Our primary role is to advise farmers on how to prevent crime taking place in the first instance. The theft of a tractor, for example, is a major blow to any farming business.”try catch  TrendingTraffic warden told she will lsquoroast in hellrsquo during argument at Portadown open air church

All three of these sectors signalled a signicant decline in activity in April.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mannnn.jpg","title":"manufacturing is ni bucking the global slowdown","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Global manufacturing and industry stalwarts such as Germany are feeling the slowdown. So, why are Northern Ireland’s makers and engineers bucking the trend  John Mulgrew takes a look at our top performers and what may be skewing the figures If there’s been an industry yet to be tainted by the ill-effects of the run-up to Brexit that I, or other journalists haven’t written about, I’d be very surprised.The latest economic metrics and predictors have been tarred by the three years of uncertainty and political instability. But, according to the latest purchasing managers’ indexfrom Ulster Bank, manufacturing here has seen an uplt – unlike the other sectors.Globally, however, the growth of the manufacturing sector has slowed closer to stagnation, sitting at . in Januaryaccording to the JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI.“At the moment, exports are falling in German manufacturing,” Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank chief economist said. “Northern Ireland and the UK compare favourably to the German powerhouse, and countries such as France and Italy.”He says that nine out of the  nations which are recorded by PMIs show manufacturing is falling.For Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole, Brexit-related stock-piling is certainly a factor. Let’s say you’re a cross-border business and you could be burdened by World Trade Organizationtarfs on your exports to the Republic in the event of a hard exit. What do you do  You produce more, and warehouse in your export market.Graeme MacLaughlin, relationship director, Barclays in Northern Ireland, said the “underlying state of health of UK manufacturing continues to be obscured by stockpiling, albeit down from the last survey’s record high, as Brexit uncertainty still thwarts investment intentions”.Ulster Business has revealed in this magazine that one major manufacturer, which has its base here, had stockpiled more than £m in food stock for its market in the Republic amid border concerns – and is now left with huge levels of product in a warehouse, with the exit from the EU now not likely until Halloween.“Continuing increases in inventories of both inputs and finished goods have exacerbated the slowdown in growth of new orders and given the loss of momentum in exporting activity, with growing signs that overseas markets are looking to alternative suppliers, the sector needs some degree of clarity on the future relationship with the EU sooner rather than later,” Graeme MacLaughlin said.Looking at what organic factors and positive stories which are fuelling the increase in manufacturing, Richard Ramsey says the success stories and expansion of firms such as CDE Global and Terex could be among those contributing.“They seem to be in expansion mode. But they are firms which are more exposed to the US, which is growing strongly. I would imagine those focused on eurozone are maybe experiencing that fall in demand.”Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, told Ulster Business that “in the past year, our firms have been busy”.“The economic conditions have been right. A purple patch indeed. Admittedly Brexit stockpiling has driven demand for many and as that begins to wash through the system in the coming monthsand with slowing of international and domestic demand, then now is the time to ensure we have the right conditions to ensure that this success is sustained.“By value, our engineering sector remains our most important. The extraordinary growth of the export focused sector in Mid Ulster, South Derry and West Tyrone contributes huge levels or employment and wages but as labour and skills have become more dficult to secure, firms have begun to spread out. CDE’s investment in Monkstown and Terex’s announcement for the North West demonstrate their commitment to creating more jobs here instead of overseas.“There has been much speculation about the demise of our manufacturing over recent years but the sector continues to confound its detractors. Employment levels, despite high profile closures, are back to  levels with exports at record levels and orders at home remaining strong. Our sector is larger and more important than manufacturing in the rest of the UK. Through direct and supported jobs, one in four local families rely on a manufacturing wage with our rural economy and community depending on manufacturers to bring both wealth and work.“Our award-winning food firms feed families at home and abroad with a greater number securing supply contracts with the UKs and Ireland’s largest buyers. Indeed news that Dale Farm had secured a supply contract with Greggs is further evidence that there is more growth possible for this critical sub-sector of manufacturing.“Often overlooked is our strength in building products. From Specialist Joinery and Carella fitting out the best of corporate offices to Smyth Steel and Macrete making the bulk of the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium, regarded as the best in Europe, in factories here before shipping on barges to London.“We’re also leading the move in construction from site build to factory built homes, schools, hospitals and offices at the McAvoy Group and Fasthouse. We have even seen a beautul table made by Terry Design from Portadown in  Downing Street.“Whether it is a critical spring on the Mars rover, or a defibrillator in the Oval office or indeed the fact that one in  people on the planet this year benefiting from a Randox test, products made in Northern Ireland are making a dference and making a huge economic contribution.“It is therefore critical that we cherish and celebrate our great firms who are making great products with great people in every postcode area. We must create the conditions that allow them to be free to make a success of their business and their community.As for the current and future “disruptor”, Richard Ramsey says while Brexit is the largest, the impact of Trump on the global economy, could have an impact on business here. “The thing is, it’s to what extentthere is when there is a trade war. Trump is increasing tarfs on China, then he focuses on the EU – how does the EU retaliate ”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/kpm_1.jpg","title":"ni bosses searching new markets to boost exports","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Around % of Northern Ireland bosses are exploring emerging markets in order grow their exports, according to the latest survey from KPMG.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add.
