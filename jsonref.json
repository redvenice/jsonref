In 1964, at the height of the Civil Rights Movement, when three activists went missing in Mississippi, Marshall went to the home of one of them, James Chaney, and was there with his Leica when the FBI turned up to tell Chaney’s mother that her son had been found, murdered by the Ku Klux Klan.In a fascinating new documentary, Show Me The Picture: The Story of Jim Marshall, the acclaimed Dutch photographer Anton Corbijn explains what made Marshall so special. First, he was remarkably good. ‘But no matter how good you are, if you don’t have the access, you don’t have the picture.’Marshall had access like no-one else, but owed his close friendships with many musicians and actors to the way he refused to exploit it. He would never betray their trust or invade their privacy. Johnny Cash loved him like a brother and often invited Marshall to his home in Tennessee for Thanksgiving.         Jim Morrison, of The Doors, was another music star who cherished Marshall\u0027s company and featured often in his pictures‘He loved going, and (Cash’s wife) June Carter really loved to cook,’ says Marshall’s longtime assistant Amelia Davis, to whom he left his entire estate when he died, aged 74, in 2010. ‘Kris Kristofferson would be there, and Shel Silverstein who wrote A Boy Named Sue. And of course Jim would have his cameras. But they all knew he would never publish the intimate pictures he took in their homes, and he never did.’He didn’t have to. The pictures of his that were published, in the likes of Life magazine and Rolling Stone, yielded all the money and reputation he needed. It was Marshall who took the almost era-defining shot at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival of Hendrix on stage setting fire to his Stratocaster guitar.The documentary chronicles the singular life of a first-generation American, the son of an immigrant Iranian mother and immigrant Syrian father, who always felt like an outsider. That was why he was drawn to African-Americans like Hendrix, the jazz virtuoso Miles Davis and the saxophonist John Coltrane, because he empathised with them in a society run, as he saw it, by the white middle-classes.Yet those feelings, of being a kind of gatecrasher, didn’t stop him being invited to lots of actual parties, and counting some of the music industry’s most famous names among his closest friends and confidants.It was as well that he did, because as Amelia Davis tells it, he couldn’t get a good photograph of someone he didn’t like. ‘Jim needed a connection with them,’ she tells the Mail. ‘If he didn’t like them, he couldn’t capture them. He got on so well with people like Miles Davis (no relation) and John Coltrane and you can see that in the pictures. Even the iconic one of Johnny Cash at San Quentin (angrily raising his middle finger or ‘flipping the bird’) came when Jim asked him if had a message for the warden.’         Marshall was the only photographer backstage at The Beatles last live concert at Candlestick Park in 1966 (pictured)         Sammy Davis Jr was one among a litany of stars photographed by Marshall, seen here backstage at CBS TV in Los Angeles in 1972         Peter Frampton, who achieved fame with his solo album Frampton Comes Alive!, performs on stage in a shot captured by MarshallAmelia Davis only ever saw Marshall cry once - the day in 2003 that he got a phone call telling him his dear friend Cash had died. But he was devastated too when Hendrix died, aged only 27. Indeed, Hendrix’s funeral in Seattle was the only day in his entire career when Marshall felt ashamed to be a photographer. He went with Miles Davis. When they got there, Marshall was shocked to see the mighty rock guitarist’s father Al, crowded by what would now be called the paparazzi.‘They wouldn’t even give him the space to grieve,’ Davis recalls. ‘Jim took one look and went and put his own cameras in the trunk of his car. He said he felt ashamed.’It took something extraordinary for Marshall to pack away his cameras. He habitually wore his beloved Leica like an extra limb and would sling it round his neck even if he was just going to the corner shop to buy milk, in case he saw something that demanded a picture. Which it often did.But it was the rock stars who made his work unique. If Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones and Jim Morrison of The Doors had anything in common beyond the fact that they were all musicians and all became members of the so-called 27 Club, dying at 27 like Kurt Cobain and Amy Winehouse long after them, it was that they also featured prominently in Marshall’s portfolio. They all recognised his talent and cherished his down-to-earth company.‘Janis especially he loved very much,’ says Davis. ‘She was real, like him. There was no artifice about Janis. And he loved photographing her, because whether she was happy or sad, she didn’t mind. Those amazing pictures he took of her backstage (in 1968), with a Southern Comfort bottle … at first she was really down in the dumps but then someone came in and said something and she started laughing. Jim captured it all, beautifully.’By contrast, Marshall once abandoned a shoot with Barbra Streisand rather than submit to her orders. Fleetwood Mac’s Stevie Nicks was another of the few stars he disliked, yet he persevered in trying to get the shot. ‘He found her very difficult and controlling,’ says Davis. ‘He liked to shoot people naturally, but she made him shoot from above, looking down. He had to stand on a ladder, which he absolutely hated.’              Marshall was good friends with Mick Jagger (left) but was especially close to Janis Joplin (right) who got along with his down-to-earth attitude         Jimi Hendrix during a sound check Monterey Pop Festival 1967, where he would later set his guitar alightMarshall had no truck with any of the paraphernalia of photography the ladders, the lights, the light-meters. ‘He was fascinated by anything mechanical, such as cars and guns,’ explains Davis. ‘In the case of cameras, that meant he knew exactly how they worked, which is why he didn’t need any of that other stuff. He usually had five cameras round his neck, two loaded with colour film, the rest with black-and-white, with different fixed lenses, and as soon as he turned up he knew exactly what he was going to do. He could judge the light and set up a shot quicker than anyone. And he knew instinctively how to put subjects at their ease.’But this was a thumping paradox, and another of Marshall’s famous friends, Michael Douglas, explains why in the documentary. ‘He’d be trying to make you as relaxed as possible, but meanwhile he was the most uptight, strung-out guy you’ve ever seen in your life.’Marshall was a mass of contradictions, starting with his almost absurdly anglicised name, for he could hardly have looked less Anglo-Saxon in origin, with beetling eyebrows that might have been painted on and a spectacularly bent nose that deserved media accreditation in its own right.He was born in Chicago in 1936 but brought up in San Francisco by his Catholic mother, who worked in a laundry, and her sisters. His father, an abusive bully and drunk who abandoned the family when his only son was still young, was a painter-decorator. Yet he came from a middle-class background in Syria and spoke 14 languages.The British director of Show Me The Picture, Alfred George Bailey, thinks that Marshall’s father probably resented his lowly social status in his adopted country and took it out on his wife and son. ‘But I also think that if Jim’s father had been a nice man, Jim would never have become a great photographer’.Photographs became his passion after he saw a snap of himself crossing a finishing line in a school race. But it was the hardships he suffered as a child that drove him to make a lifelong project of his passion. In fact, Bailey recorded Douglas talking about how his own movie-star father, Kirk, had also suffered at the hands of an abusive parent and how the experience had forged him, too. ‘But because the documentary is about Jim, we weren’t able to use that stuff,’ he tells the Mail.In Marshall’s case, abuse and abandonment by his father may also have explained his own enduring chippiness and occasional violent rages. In an interview, he once said that ‘cars and guns have gotten me into trouble. Cameras haven’t.’         Jim Marshall himself is seen in front of the camera. A new documentary charts his lifeThe gun trouble came when he confronted a man he suspected of seeing his wife, Rebecca, who would eventually leave him without warning, taking $20,000 with her – although admittedly by then he had allegedly locked her in a cupboard, nailing the door shut. He had a longer and more successful relationship with Michelle Margetts, who met him when she was a journalism student interviewing him for an assignment. At first, he seemed like ‘a little malevolent gnome’. But when he started pouring his heart out, she realised how much vulnerability lay behind his spiky exterior.Spiky wasn’t the half of it. During the altercation with the man he suspected of cuckolding him, he fired his gun into the pavement as a scare tactic, but a bullet ricocheted up and hit the guy. Marshall duly served the US equivalent of community service. But it didn’t always take betrayals as seismic as marital infidelity to enrage him. He had a pathological hatred of onions, and if he was ever served them in restaurants where he thought the staff knew his foibles, he would, to mix foodstuffs, go bananas.‘Almost everyone we spoke to had an onion story about Jim,’ says Bailey.He might not have known his onions, but he certainly knew his drugs. He had a serious cocaine habit for years, which he didn’t kick until after he’d turned 70. Yet perhaps the defining contradiction about Marshall was that, for all the many reasons people had to dislike him, so many loved him.‘He could be impossible,’ says Davis, ‘but he never had pretences, there was no aura, he was always himself, speaking his mind and not sucking up. They all appreciated that. Joan Baez was one of his closest friends even though they were opposites in many ways – the pacifist singer and the gruff guy who loved guns’.Marshall took many wonderful shots of Baez, and a famous sequence of her sometime boyfriend Bob Dylan, pushing a stray tyre down a New York street. He has left an indelible record of an epic era, and more than a few photographs that have themselves become icons, not least the snaps of Cash during those extraordinary prison concerts.There was no film crew there, only Marshall. ‘What happened there was captured as true as it could be by Jim Marshall,’ says Cash’s son, John Carter Cash, in the documentary. ‘I’m grateful there isn’t a film, because I believe he captured it better.’It’s an epitaph the singular Jim Marshall would have loved."},{"url":null,"title":"Grandparents lottery win new knees","story":"Share this article \u0027It was only when I went to check for a second time that I saw all of the zeros.\u0027I was just in a state of shock.

Many businesses in the area also made plans to close or operate on a reduced schedule. At Children\u0027s Mercy Kansas City, the emergency room at the main downtown hospital will be open, but appointments and some surgeries were being rescheduled or moved.         Wednesday\u0027s parade route goes along Grand Street The city provided free shuttles, but dropped parade-goers further from the route to prevent buses from becoming trapped in traffic as happened during the Royals parade.Kansas City police Major Chip Huth said law enforcement from 19 surrounding agencies were on call to help provide security for the masses.\u0027The main thing we have learned,\u0027 he said, \u0027is that we need to be ahead of the response.\u0027The weather made it particularly difficult getting home, due to some light snowfall. \u0027One of our messages is it probably won\u0027t be bad getting to the parade but there will be hazardous conditions leaving the parade,\u0027 National Weather Service meteorologist Jimmy Barham said beforehand.The National Weather Service predicted 2 inches to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters) of snowfall Wednesday along the parade route, with up to 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) in the Columbia area.University of Missouri officials announced Wednesday morning that no classes would be held after 1pm because of the storm.The Missouri Department of Transportation warned in a tweet that road conditions are worsening as the snowfall picks up. The tweet said, \u0027If you can avoid it, DO NOT TRAVEL in this storm today!\u0027In neighboring Kansas, Pittsburg State University announced the cancellation of men\u0027s and women\u0027s basketball games.Winter storm warnings also were in effect from eastern New Mexico to the St. Louis metropolitan area.           Kansas City Chiefs Quarterback and Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes gestures to the crowd as he rides by on Wednesday         The city learned from that experience and is making adjustments, adding a temporary cell tower and increasing the number of portable toilets to 700 from 200. Officials also are boosting the number of lost child stations - something that was deemed crucial after about 100 youngsters became separated from their caretakers in 2015         Chiefs hats, blankets, scarves and sweatshirts were seen along the parade route on Wednesday Although it took five decades for the Chiefs to win a second Super Bowl, the team\u0027s players don\u0027t expect to wait that long for a third. \u0027Next year we\u0027re coming back,\u0027 Chiefs defensive tackle Chris Jones said after Sunday\u0027s win. \u0027We\u0027re coming back for a repeat.\u0027 There\u0027s plenty of reasons to believe they can do it. The Chiefs will return just about every key piece that delivered the city its first championship in 50 years, including Super Bowl MVP Patrick Mahomes, breakout star Damien Williams and the core of their rebuilt defense, along with a coaching staff that\u0027s gotten plenty of interest for head coaching jobs elsewhere.So perhaps it was no surprise that most Las Vegas sports books already have installed the Chiefs as 6-to-1 favorites to win the Super Bowl next season. The Baltimore Ravens and NFC champion Niners were close behind.\u0027I\u0027m really excited about it. You get one, you want to get another,\u0027 said Andy Reid, who finally got to bask in his first Super Bowl championship after 21 years of coaching. \u0027But we\u0027ve got to backpedal a minute and enjoy this one, and then we\u0027ll get busy on the next one.\u0027There certainly will be plenty of time to celebrate. The Chiefs wrapped up some media obligations in Miami on Monday, then were to head back to Kansas City, where an entire city was prepping for a victory parade Wednesday.Not long after that, though, expect Reid and general manager Brett Veach to get down to business.The Chiefs are likely to make Mahomes the NFL\u0027s highest-paid player this offseason, the first opportunity he will have to sign a contract extension. The Chiefs also must decide what to do with Jones, one of the league\u0027s premier defensive linemen, who is eligible for free agency but has expressed his desire to remain with the team on a long-term deal.\u0027Why wouldn\u0027t I want to be here?\u0027 he asked. \u0027We have a chance to be a dynasty.\u0027         Kansas City Police arrest a suspect who led police on a chase down the main parade route on Grand Street three hours before the Kansas City Super Bowl Parade on WednesdayThe Chiefs also had a number of role players whose deals are expiring, and bringing them back or unearthing replacements will be crucial during free agency. Among them are defensive linemen Terrell Suggs, Emmanuel Ogbah and Xavier Williams, wide receiver Demarcus Robinson, and cornerbacks Bashaud Breeland and Kendall Fuller.Another question facing the Chiefs: What will they do with Sammy Watkins, who proved his worth with a massive playoff run capped by five catches for 98 yards in the Super Bowl. He is due to count $21 million against the salary cap next year, so the Chiefs are likely to ask him to take a pay cut or restructure his contract or be forced to release him.\u0027If we keep going the way we\u0027re going, the sky is the limit for this team,\u0027 said Watkins, who contradicted reports he might even sit out next season by insisting he\u0027d return. \u0027Why not? We\u0027ll come back and win next year.\u0027But even with all those holes to fill, the Chiefs are still in enviable shape. They have arguably the league\u0027s best quarterback and one of its most electrifying pass-catchers in Tyreek Hill. They have one of its premier tight ends in Travis Kelce and a running back in Damien Williams, who gashed the 49ers for 104 yards rushing with TDs on the ground and through the air.On defense, they have elite pass rusher Frank Clark and safety Tyrann Mathieu — the prize acquisitions last offseason who came up big in the Super Bowl — signed to contracts that will keep them in Kansas City at least two more years.\u0027It will be important to keep a couple of those other guys and obviously continue to get better, whether that\u0027s through the draft or free agency,\u0027 Mathieu said. \u0027The most important thing is our core is intact. We\u0027ve got a hell of a football team, so we are looking forward to next season already.\u0027There have been seven franchises that have won back-to-back Super Bowls, including the Pittsburgh Steelers, who did the trick twice in the 1970s. That now becomes the goal for a team that sees a window of dominance opening in the AFC, where the Chiefs and Ravens already have begun to replace the New England Patriots as the gold standard.\u0027I think as long as we keep the people that we have in this organization on this team, with the coach that we have, I think we have a chance to be good year-in and year-out,\u0027 Mahomes said. \u0027It\u0027s not going to be easy. We\u0027re sitting here right now, and I know that going back, we\u0027re going to have next year to play a lot of great football teams. There\u0027s a lot of great teams in this league, so you understand that. But at the same time, just try to get better every year.\u0027Not just to reach the pinnacle of the game. At long last, the Chiefs finally have accomplished that.The task facing them now is staying there.           Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes cheers with the crowd during Wednesday\u0027s Super Bowl victory parade          A view of Union Station before the Kansas City Chief Super Bowl LIV Champions Parade"},{"url":null,"title":"New vaccine hope viruses discovered one eight tumours","story":"Share this article International researchers looked at 38 different types of cancer, studying the genetic code of tumours to search for virus DNA.They found it in tumours from 356 out of more than 2,600 patients and were surprised to see some evidence that Epstein-Barr virus, human herpes virus 6B and hepatitis B may be involved in breast cancer.

The project saw 12 classic young adult novels receive new covers, the protagonists now “culturally erse”. Frankenstein has brown skin, not green, while a kissing Romeo and Juliet have darker skin tones and kinky hair textures. “For the first time ever, all parents will be able to pick up a book and see themselves in a story,” the company explains on the back cover of the books.But prominent authors were quick to lambast the company, saying that simply changing the skin color of characters like Romeo and Juliet or Frankenstein is a superficial fix, and that the publishing industry should do more to promote writers of color.Writers including Roxane Gay, the author of Bad Feminist, and The Hate U Give writer Angie Thomas, viewed the covers as a superficial fix to a larger problem. “The only thing you’re disrupting is #BlackHistoryMonth and the literary dignity of communities of color,” David Bowles, a Latinx children’s writer and poet, wrote to Barnes and Noble on Twitter. “So disappointed in you.”“This fake ersity nonsense (where they replace white characters with people of color) is disgusting,” the Hugo-winning fantasy writer Nnedi Okorafor wrote. “It is not sincere or a solution. New stories by people of color about people of color is the solution… Stop using us and get out of the way!”In a statement to the , Barnes and Noble said: “We acknowledge the voices who have expressed concerns about the Diverse Editions project at our Barnes \u0026amp Noble Fifth Avenue store and have decided to suspend the initiative. The covers are not a substitute for black voices or writers of color, whose work and voices deserve to be heard. The booksellers who championed this initiative did so convinced it would help drive engagement with these classic titles.”The company also clarified that the covers were designed by artists of different ethnicities and backgrounds.The decision of which book covers to redesign was made using artificial intelligence to analyze the text from 100 of the most famous titles in western literature, searching the texts to “see if it omitted the ethnicity of primary characters”. The 12 classics found to meet this criteria were: Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, Moby Dick, Emma, The Secret Garden, Treasure Island, The Count of Monte Cristo, Frankenstein, Peter Pan, The Wizard of Oz, The Three Musketeers, The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, and Romeo and Juliet.Justina Ireland, the acclaimed writer of YA novel Dread Nation, pointed out the flaws of this approach. She called it a quick attempt to “make a buck”.Ireland wrote: “And this says nothing to the assumption that a little white girl raised in India as a colonizer (Secret Garden) would be culturally the same as a little Asian or Indian or Black girl raised anywhere else ever. Erasing cultural differences is not ersity… Because what it says is that at the end of the day people of color want to be white. And fam, that ain’t it.”Barnes and Noble’s swift apology comes as the publishing industry confronts increasing debates around race. Earlier this week, Flatiron Books, an imprint of Macmillan Publishers, faced heavy criticism over its controversial novel, American Dirt, a book many say unfairly profits off the suffering and trauma of Mexican immigrants. Flatiron made a commitment to hire more Latinx staff and publish more books by Latinx authors. A new study by Lee and Low Books found that, despite concentrated efforts and initiatives by the industry, publishing is just as white as it was four years ago.Bowles told the  on Wednesday that he confronted Sanyu Dillon, the director of publicity of Penguin Random House, the publisher that collaborated on the project, outside a Barnes and Noble location on New York’s Fifth Avenue. “Dillon said she and three other people of color were in the room,” Bowles said, arguing that people of color in positions of power can also make serious blunders around representation. “This was not a decision by white higher ups. POCs are not automatically exempt from being dumbasses.”Bowles says he’s tired of the publishing industry’s blunders, and has met with Macmillan executives about improving its relationship with the Latinx community after publishing American Dirt. He added that he is putting his career on the line by protesting Barnes and Noble, which sells a disproportionate amount of his books. “It’s people from communities of color who are being villainized,” he said, calling for white authors and editors to become more vocal. “It’s bothersome they just wait for us to get pissed off and be in front of the drama.”In response to the outrage, Penguin Random House announced it will donate $10,000 to the Hurston Wright Foundation, which works with up-and-coming black authors. They are also launching a Twitter donation campaign, giving a dollar to Hurston Wright each time someone tweets the hashtag #BlackStoriesHavePower.Color of Change, a racial justice organization, called Diverse Editions “literary blackface” and told the  it is planning “a series of actions in response to the offensive initiative”.Barnes and Noble still plans to honor and participate in Black History Month this year. The company said: “Barnes and Noble stores nationally will continue to highlight a wide selection of books to celebrate black history and great literature from writers of color.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0101e99351c8b35a69466299dc453c8c34906909/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71133c204f630b5bebeead9eb9006205","title":"labour haringey council north london","story":"A row over a London street market is pitting local people against a Labour-run council and its dealings with a developerHow does a political party lose its heartlands? The question tortures a devastated Labour movement. How it’s answered by the next great red hope will help decide whether Boris Johnson spends just five years at No 10 or many, many more. Whatever Westminster types may think, voters deserting the party that was once their home isn’t a one-off event that only happens way up the M1, in some faraway land where locals reminisce about Arthur Scargill as if he were a distant cousin. It is a process that can be replicated wherever a giant gulf opens up between voters and their representatives – and if politicians and pundits only look, a prize example of how a party can lose its people is happening right now in the capital.Haringey in north London is not what lefty romantics mean by heartlands. Yet the council has been Labour-run almost since its creation. Of the area’s two parliamentary seats, Tottenham has kept the red flag flying for half a century. Lose the teary sentiment and the reality for Labour today is that its core voter is not always a white man in a factory town long since retired off an assembly line but as likely to be a black woman in the inner city who gets by on low-paid care work. Make no mistake, if Labour loses the likes of Tottenham, then it really is finished.Yet over the past few days the jarring din of a voter base pulling up anchor from its bed has been coming out of Tottenham politics, and it signals trouble for Labour. The thing about heartlands is you lose them over decades, but one day you wake up and your one-party statelet is gone. Just ask Dennis Skinner.The past fortnight has seen a chaotic council meeting in which the leader was drowned out by heckling from the gallery and a party meeting in which delegates and even cabinet councillors turned on the cabinet. Anyone familiar with Haringey knows these as the rough-and-ready terms of local political trade. But more unusual is the local MP, David Lammy, damning both the council and London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, from the Commons. Or a visiting Khan getting barraged with angry calls for action. Or a face-off between locals and a private firm in which the council is sprayed with abuse.The source of all this noise is an important hub for Latin American migrants – their indoor marketplace, their labour exchange, their community hall – a warren in Tottenham selling everything from steaks to a blow-dry. Called the Latin Village, these 60-odd stalls are run mainly by women, with children running about after school on Saturday evenings salsa breaks out. In other words, it is magic. Were the Latin Village in Brooklyn, it would be a huge tourist attraction over here the traders have been treated with contempt.It sits bang in the middle of a huge redevelopment. The giant landlord Grainger plans to rebuild the market and open a tower opposite with nearly 200 flats. This wasn’t designed for locals: not one unit here will be social housing, and the original plans envisaged a “Pasta Express” and “Coste Coffee”, as if that beat the Colombian coffee already on sale. Much of the site is held by the mayor’s Transport for London (TfL), while Haringey owns other bits and is the planning authority. The traders, together with other locals and activists, have had to fight both legally and politically for years to force the Labour council of one of the most multicultural parts of Europe to respect race relations laws and to build in protections for the market. Among those concessions was that non-English-speaking traders should have a market facilitator to speak for them to the market operator.The operator is called Market Asset Management, and is represented at Latin Village by the MAM director, Jonathan Owen. The facilitator appointed by landlord Grainger was, until the end of 2018, Jonathan Owen. So if traders wished to complain about Jonathan Owen, they had to go to Jonathan Owen. Neither Grainger nor Haringey saw anything wrong with this for years. After I and others noted his record of abuse, referring to market entrepreneurs as “bloody illegal immigrants”, the developer’s response was to remove him as facilitator – without installing a replacement.A couple of Fridays ago MAM sent in bailiffs to evict a trader, seemingly with no notice. The apparent claim was that the trader had not paid his rent but a solicitor’s letter I have seen from last year complains on the trader’s behalf that MAM would not accept his rent payments, perhaps the better to kick him out (Owen did not respond to any of my questions). TfL and Haringey both confirm they knew about the eviction attempt days in advance, yet MAM went ahead and could have succeeded had it not been for local activists, Labour members and a few backbench councillors mobbing the market.Responsibility for this mess is batted back and forth between City Hall and the Civic Centre. The mayor refers to Haringey’s responsibilities, while the council leader, Joe Ejiofor, points out the crucial land is owned by TfL, chaired by none other than the mayor. Ping pong, ping pong! As Tottenham Labour delegates argued in a general committee motion last week castigating both Khan and Ejiofor, “the buck-passing over responsibility is having a devastating effect upon the traders”. That motion passed by a whopping 64 to 1. In parliament last week, Lammy cited a “very serious allegation of overcharging of traders for electricity and other utilities by the market operator – allegations that might amount to fraud and which ought to require police involvement”. These comments are dismissed by Owen as “regrettably ill-informed” but TfL says it will contact him about the allegations.Senior councillors, even those supportive of the leader, can see how this is hurting Labour. “Just like the general election, we’re not listening to our own voters,” says one. Others predict that Ejiofor has only a few months left in charge – “he is so hated for the Latin Village” – which would make him the second Haringey leader in a row to be brought down by a regeneration scandal.The irony is that Ejiofor has done some good, saving a nursing home from closure, putting staff on the London living wage, and cutting council tax for those most in need. But the credit he deserves for that has been lost in the noise over this: a borough vowing to build council homes aiding a huge project that will put up none. An administration pledging to protect small businesses but letting them face abuse and summary evictions. A leadership that talks of community wealth-building while bending over backwards for a giant developer.How does a political party lose its heartlands? Through broken promises and stinking hypocrisy, and finally for appearing to sit in opposition to its own voters."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80bc18d23ac1f56d55270cafb0ac0da21670d5a3/0_116_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5048f7301d6e81e28ad7a1215406552e","title":"south african photographer santu mofokeng in pictures","story":"The documentary photographer, best known for recording everyday life in the townships of South Africa, has died.

It is thought unlikely Johnson would reach across party lines to a Labour grandee, such as Gordon Brown, or David Miliband – a former environment secretary – or across Brexit lines to remainer candidates, such as the former Tory prime minister John Major or Lord Deben a former Tory environment secretary.That leaves a narrowing field, and though a serving minister will carry governmental authority, the time commitment is likely to rule out sharing it with another major role, such as trade talks. The bookmaker Ladbrokes said it was offering 5-1 on Gove, with Zac Goldsmith – also a prominent environmentalist – ahead at 3-1, and Andrea Leadsom at 10-1.Cameron and Hague are understood to have cited other commitments and concerns over the role when they turned down approaches to take on the presidency, which was left vacant by the abrupt sacking of the former energy minister Claire O’Neill last Friday.That decision, without a replacement waiting in the wings, has left a yawning gap over several days which O’Neill has filled with bitter attacks on the government’s record, and Johnson’s character, while a further damaging row blew up over the Scottish government’s arrangements at the proposed venue in Glasgow.For almost three decades, world governments have met every year to forge a global response to the climate emergency. Under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, every country on earth is treaty-bound to “avoid dangerous climate change”, and find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally in an equitable way. COP stands for conference of the parties under the UNFCCC.The UK will host COP 26 this November in Glasgow. In the Paris agreement of 2015, all governments agreed for the first time\u0026nbspto limit global heating to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels, and set out non-binding national targets on greenhouse gases to achieve that. However, these targets are insufficient, and if allowed to stand would lead to an estimated 3C of heating, which scientists say would spell disaster. For that reason, the COP 26 talks in Glasgow are viewed as the last chance for global cooperation on the emergency, with countries expected to come with tough new targets on emissions.The negotiations will be led by environment ministers and civil servants, aided by UN officials. Nearly every country is expected to send a voting representative at the level of environment secretary or equivalent, and the big economies will have extensive delegations.Each of the 196 nations on earth, bar a few failed states, is a signatory to the UNFCCC foundation treaty. The COPs, for all their flaws, are the only forum on the climate crisis in which the opinions and concerns of the poorest country carry equal weight to that of the biggest economies, such as the US and China. Agreement can only come by consensus, which gives COP decisions global authority.Chris Stark, the chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change, , the government’s statutory adviser, tweeted: “I think I speak for most friendly independent climate advisory bodies when I say I’d like to see this COP 26 business sorted out sharpish. It’s very important that the UK is brilliant in the presidency and that Scotland is brilliant as the host for this summit.”Doug Parr, policy director at Greenpeace UK, said: “In international diplomacy, signals do matter, and the longer the position of COP 26 president remains vacant, the weaker Britain’s authority as host will look.” Campaigners have also pointed to the lack of a clear strategy or timetable laid out by Johnson at the launch event. One COP observer said: “You have to look serious, to inspire confidence among world leaders. We aren’t seeing them look serious.”Representatives from developing countries said the UK could still turn around the situation, but it would require swift action before the impression took hold of a government lacking control and a coherent plan.When the French government took on the COP presidency ahead of the Paris agreement in 2015, ministers had clear roles and a roster of events for the year was set out covering all aspects of a possible agreement, from climate science to green technology, and the delivery of finance for developing countries. Every ambassador and high-ranking officials in French embassies around the world were given instructions to bring up climate change at every possible meeting.At the UK launch, apart from a new logo for a “year of climate action”, there was no detail on how COP 26 would be managed. The only events mentioned, apart from the summit itself in November, were two pre-meetings for negotiators arranged by the Italian government, which has formal co-host status alongside the UK.Johnson’s attempt to take charge of the talks himself, by joining Sir David Attenborough on stage at the Science Museum launch, also appeared to backfire. The prime minister said little of substance, preferring to talk about a 19th-century pioneer of electric taxis, and the absence of a COP 26 president was made all the more obvious.Tom Burke, founder of the E3G environmental group, said: “The prime minister made a hash of launching COP 26, and has put a dent in the UK’s deserved reputation for climate leadership.”A passionate environmentalist and former owner of the Ecologist magazine, Goldsmith was appointed to the Lords with a ministerial role at the Department for International Development after losing his seat in the general election.Hotly tipped within Westminster, Gove surprised green campaigners by proving an effective and reforming environment secretary, having outed himself as a “shy green Tory”. Can bank on goodwill and respect among the climate community, and has the ministerial heft and record. Also enjoys good relations with Rupert Murdoch and was described as a “phenomenon” by Donald Trump. Gove was thought to want a greater role in the negotiations on new trade deals following Brexit, but now that David Frost has taken on more of that responsibility, Gove may be willing to consider the COP 26 role.A prospect viewed with horror by climate campaigners. Leadsom is reported to have asked officials whether climate change was real when taking up her previous role as energy minister.Took on a strong role at the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, and as a Scot would relish hosting the conference in Glasgow. But as a former Labour prime minister, the chances seem slim.Former leader of the Conservative party, and environment minister under John Major. He was instrumental in leading George HW Bush to sign the UN framework convention on climate change at Rio in 1992. In recent years he has made the case for stronger action on the climate crisis.The former secretary of state at the Department of Energy and Climate Change has experience of COPs and the COP process.As John Selwyn Gummer, he was a well-regarded environment minister under Margaret Thatcher. Currently chairman of the Committee on Climate Change, where he takes a robust view of the government’s need to step up its actions to deliver net zero emissions by 2050. His strongly pro-remain stance is likely to rule him out, however.The former chancellor only has six – or is it nine? – jobs already, including editing the Evening Standard and advising fossil fuel investors BlackRock, which recently pledged to examine the climate impacts of its investments.The only living ex-Tory male Tory prime minister not to have been approached (yet).

But more and more brands are developing innovative ways to lessen the damageWhy are jeans so controversial? Is it the estimated 10,000 litres of water needed to grow the cotton for every pair? The dark blue lines of toxic pollution in China’s Pearl River that can be seen from space? The potassium permanganate, widely used to make new jeans look old and distressed, that may cause lung damage in workers? Or is it because there is no guarantee that those workers are paid a living wage, never mind being paid for the overtime they are forced to do?“The denim industry is at a pivotal moment,” says Roian Atwood, senior director of global sustainable business at Kontoor Brands, which owns Wrangler and Lee, when we met at ART (Art Repair Transform), a denim upcycling and mending workshop at the Copenhagen international fashion last month. Lee are among the 30 brands contributing to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Jeans Redesign project, a new initiative governing all aspects of jean production from regeneratively farmed fibres to washing and finishing techniques – potassium permanganate, for example, is not allowed. Jeans must be made with rivets and hardware that can easily be removed after the jeans are no longer fit for purpose, allowing them to be recycled into something new. The first products bearing the Jeans Redesign logo will go on sale in the autumn.The industry is working hard to make itself cleaner and more sustainable, investing in new technology such as the innovative dry foam to dye Lee’s Indigood jeans – the use of water is pretty much eliminated, as well as reducing energy and chemicals and hopefully ending the rivers of toxic blue effluent. Already in operation at three denim mills in Spain, Mexico and India, Lee is also launching “compostable” jeans this spring. “They will fully decompose,” says Atwood. “We believe it will take 200 days.”There is still a long way to go. According to Atwood, there is “a new and emerging environmental issue we are not quite ready to talk about yet, which is that denim has become integrated with a lot of synthetics. The comfort and the stretch movement, athleisure and the omnipresence of the yoga pant have given rise to a lot more stretch in denim. It’s plastic,” he says. And as such, your skinny jeans are responsible for shedding microplastics.Appropriately enough, we meet in the “confessional booth” designed for visitors to confess their fashion sins and record them for a podcast. “If we are confessing our sins, I am here to say I like to wear light jeans,” he says. “A dark pair of denim uses less water in the wash-down process.” The lighter the denim, the more washing processes it has been through and the more water it has used.The designer Duran Lantink, who was commissioned to work with Lee’s deadstock to create a small collection of upcycled denim, wears jeans every day (he switches between two vintage pairs) but is aware of the issues. “I think that, by buying a pre-washed jean, it is ruin in reverse,” he says. “I don’t get that.”Lantink is part of a growing band of designers who are not just concerned about the environmental impact of the industry but also its waste. Bethany Williams, who has perfected the art of unpicking and upcycling unwanted jeans, has grown a cult following. Brands such as E.L.V. Denim (short for East London Vintage), which is sold at a range of stockists including Net-a-Porter, are building healthy businesses using secondhand denim as their raw material. “There are more jeans than people in the world,” says founder Anna Foster. At her studio and showroom, clients can choose from off-the-peg or custom-made jeans, ingeniously spliced together a few miles away at the Blackhorse Lane Ateliers in Walthamstow. But slowing down production is not on the agenda for the big denim brands, who would prefer to cut their environmental impact by reducing water and chemical consumption while continuing to produce at the same levels. However, there are some smart and potentially highly disruptive initiatives coming from smaller independents. Netherlands-based Mud Jeans offers a subscription system that allows you to lease your jeans for €7.50 per month, including free repairs. Once you are finished with your jeans, you send them back and they will be recycled. Hiut Jeans, which has revitalised the denim industry in Cardigan, Wales, makes just 100 pairs of jeans per week. “We are here to try and make the best jeans we can and not the most jeans we can,” it says. It also offer free repairs for life.Whether you are a denim aficionado or a student on a budget, you can find jeans to suit your budget and your style if you shop secondhand.Raw denim hasn’t been washed and treated multiple times. This is what denim used to look like before we started to sandblast, bleach and rip it to make it look old. Buy a pair of unwashed jeans and let them age with you.Let leggings be leggings and jeans be jeans. One hundred per cent means the denim in your jeans can eventually be recycled.One of the biggest sources of water impact and energy use is during the consumer use phase. Roian Atwood advises a cold wash. Hiut Denim has a No Wash Club.A good pair of jeans can last for decades if you look after them and repair them. Ask your denim brand where you can have your jeans repaired. Levi’s has a number of tailor shops where you can customise or repair jeans. Nudie Jeans offers free repairs for life in their shops or, if you can’t get to one, they will send you a free repair kit. Hiut Jeans also offer free repairs.

In 1928, the automobile magnate Walter P Chrysler set out to create the greatest skyscraper on Earth, but the record for the world’s tallest building was held for only 11 months before it was overshadowed by the Empire State Building. The terraced crown that is the Chrysler’s most distinctive feature – a seven-storey decorative shell without floors or glazed windows – was dismissed by critics as a gimmick.But, in 2020, the Chrysler is the height of fashion. It has become an architectural icon, a beloved art deco treasure, as symbolic of Manhattan as the Eiffel Tower is of Paris. And the signature silhouette – the elegant, wedding-cake tiers, graphic but graceful, tapering skyward – is the most on-trend shape. The tiered dress is to fashion today what the hourglass was during the New Look craze of 1947 or what the bellbottom was to 1971. The first trend of the new decade is here – and it is 2os skyscraper chic.You may be wearing this dress already without realising how cutting edge you are. In its wearable, everyday form, it has a simple neckline and skims the body to the waist, where it connects to a waist-to-hip tier with a little more fabric, so that the silhouette gets looser and a little wider. A little lower, there is another horizontal seam and a lower tier with yet more fabric, and so on, to the hem. The fabric is soft and unstructured, so that the shape falls with a natural gravity, rather than a grand, stiff kind of volume.The Chrysler silhouette crosses all fashion ides. It was a key look for fashion’s biggest labels in their first collections of this decade. There was a monochrome gown at Chanel, with white buttons on a white bodice and a floor-length skirt of three tiers of black organza. At Dior, a polka-dot sheer dress was embroidered at the horizontal seams iding the four stacked layers of the skirt, to emphasise the tiered construction.Tiers were everywhere, from the avant garde catwalk of Simone Rocha – where overlapping layers of black lace were worn with a crochet harness and a latex skullcap – to Óscar de la Renta, the favourite label of New York’s socialites, where a floral, floor-length gown in tiers of cream and caramel, with matching belt and bag, was garden-party perfect.What is remarkable about the popularity of the Chrysler shape is that this dress does not make you look thin. It does not emphasise the waist, nor does it slim your silhouette. It simply does not kowtow to the age-old tyranny of thinness in fashion. This makes it supremely relaxing to wear – you can breathe out, literally – which lends it a laid-back kind of mood-music when you wear it. They say that flattery will get you everywhere, but the triumph of the tiered dress shows that, in fashion, this is no longer the case. “Flattering” is no longer the be-all and end-all of compliments, from a style point of view. There is a modern take on dressing up that is more about glamour and less about sex appeal.The first noteable on-screen appearance of a tiered dress in modern pop culture came in Killing Eve, in the form of the pink Molly Goddard frock worn by Villanelle. It was an unforgettable fashion moment precisely because the aesthetic impact was so unsettling. Traditionally, sugar-pink is the most feminine of colours, an international aesthetic code for conventional prettiness. But splayed on the sofa in her giant triangular dress, Villanelle had all the cockiness of a man-spreader on a tube carriage. The natural successor to Villanelle was Gemma Chan at last year’s Oscars, with one hand in the pocket – pocket! – of her Valentino gown, which was constructed in 12 horizontal layers of hot-pink parachute silk. Ariana Grande, returning to the Grammys last month after skipping 2019’s ceremony, pulled a similar tiered-gown power move in the vast pyramid of a Giambattista Valli gown in a sombre shade of slate grey.A lot of you – and I mean a lot of you – have worn this dress already, because it was the basic shape of the £40 Zara polka-dot dress that stole summer 2019. But where that dress had just two layers to its tiered skirt, the 2020 model usually has three or more, which is what gives it that skyscraper-esque, Chrysler-shaped ambition. (Zara has a graphic white mini version, for £29.99, which takes aim at your holiday wardrobe.)The lesson of the Zara dress, as the high street learned, is that – mindful not to overshop – we are increasingly drawn to what buyers call the three-day-a-week dress. This is a dress that works with flats and heels, for work and weekends, and lasts a day-to-night wear because it is comfy and doesn’t crease too much. It is a dress you can rely on, a dress you pack for every trip because it gets you out of wardrobe trouble. At its most sober and office-appropriate, this can be a shirt dress – Toast has an elegant collared dress in drapey viscose crepe, with softly gathered tiers and a scattered floral print, for £170. In its most fashionable form, the Chrysler dress cross-pollinates with Americana in its other vogueish form. The prairie dress is where Scandi chic meets pop culture’s yeehaw trend, in which the cowboy is making a postmodern comeback. (Lil Nas X’s Old Town Road wasn’t the longest-running No 1 in US chart history for nothing.)The prairie version of a Chrysler dress features some kind of Little House on the Prairie detailing – a Laura Ashley-esque fabric, a puffed sleeve, smocking – as well as the modish, Fab-lolly-tiered silhouette. Copenhagen-chic label Ganni and London-based Rixo, both of which have been well ahead of the Chrysler curve for several seasons, have western-inspired styles. Rixo’s Becky dress, £335, has a high frilled neckline and puff sleeves.

The film producer appeared in the lobby of the hotel and they began talking about the reality TV show America’s Next Top Model which he suggested Young might be able to join.They continued talking about the show as Weinstein asked Young and the other woman up to his hotel room, she told the jury. She was led into the suite – Weinstein in front of her, the acquaintance behind her – following the defendant through the living room, down a corridor and into the bathroom.Suddenly, Young said, the encounter turned coercive. As she entered the bathroom she saw through a mirror that her acquaintance had closed the door behind her, shutting her and Weinstein in.The movie producer, the witness alleged, went to the shower, turned it on and immediately started undressing.“I stood there in shock. He was already naked at that point. He stepped in front of me when I went to approach the door with his naked body right in front of me. I felt so trapped.”Young went on to claim that Weinstein pushed her back against the bathroom sink, unzipped and pulled down the white lace dress she was wearing, and began groping her breast as he masturbated. “I said ‘no, no, no’, the whole time that I had a boyfriend that I wasn’t interested. He’s carrying on with conversation, ‘This is what all actresses do, to make it’.”The defendant continued to masturbate, Young said, until he ejaculated on a towel.Young was asked by prosecutors to describe any memorable features of Weinstein’s anatomy. She said that his genitals were peculiar.“It looked like it had been cut and sewn back on, not a normal-looking scar from circumcision. Something looked wrong. I didn’t really see balls in a sack.”The film producer’s body parts have emerged as an evidentiary factor in the trial. One of the two main accusers in the case, who alleges she was raped by Weinstein in a New York hotel in 2013, told the jury that he appeared to be “intersex”.“He does not have testicles and it appears he has a vagina,” the accuser said in testimony earlier this week.On Tuesday prosecutors showed the jury official photographs of the movie mogul’s body. The images were handed to jurors to inspect without being visible to the public in the courtroom.Young is one of three witnesses who have been included in the trial even though their allegations are not actively being prosecuted. They have been called to provide evidence of “prior bad acts”, a type of supporting testimony known as Molineux witnesses under New York law.Weinstein, 67, has pleaded not guilty to five counts and faces a possible sentence of life imprisonment. Two of the counts are rape, relating to the woman who alleges she was violated in 2013, and one count is that he forced oral sex on the former production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006.The two other counts are for predatory sexual assault – the idea that Weinstein displayed a pattern of behavior, or modus operandi, going back several years. These are the counts that carry the potential life sentence.As a further complicating factor, Young is one of two women accusing the film producer of sex crimes in a case being prosecuted by the Los Angeles district attorney’s offices. Charges in that separate case, for which Weinstein faces up to 28 years in prison if convicted, were announced on 6 January – the same day as the New York trial began.After Young gave her testimony, she was cross-examined by one of Weinstein’s defense lawyers, Damon Cheronis. In a dramatic move, he produced the white lace dress that the witness alleged she had been wearing at the time of the 2013 incident and had never worn since.Cheronis pressed Young over how she had come to discover the dress only three days ago, she said in a box of clothes she had left behind in LA after a house move. The court heard in earlier legal argument that LA prosecutors intend to test the garment for DNA that may or may not tie it to Weinstein."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d7d8a89c81a0ee67ae35844a8510c5150afcccaa/0_139_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d06438fef2fefe56ec1cacd000a77a5","title":"david athertons recipe for banana energy balls","story":"These oat, date and chocolate energy balls do not contain unnecessary fat, so tick all the right boxes for a pre-gym snackThere are endless variations on date-based energy snacks, but I think this version ticks all the right boxes for a pre-gym snack.

Most energy snacks use the dates to bind the other ingredients together. They are rich, caramelly and chewy, but they can also be a bit grainy and sticky. These energy balls are smooth and glossy due to the emulsifying effect of the melted dark chocolate.

Top chefs from Yotam Ottolenghi to Tom Kerridge reveal what they would buy for under a fiverIt is cold. It is dark. It is winter. And post-Christmas, we all feel skint. How do you lift spirits and put some sizzle in your cooking without spending much? We asked some of Britain’s best chefs: if you had a fiver or less to spend – what would you buy??The Dutch East India company listed soy sauce in 1737. It has a long history in Europe, but I don’t think British people understand how powerful it is. It’s liquid umami for a couple of quid and, used judiciously, it’s amazing in bolognese, chilli, stews and marinades. If you’re frying mushrooms and want a real flavour boost, bung a tablespoon in and reduce it down. Hat tip on this to Tara Wigley, who I write with. Buy as many green and red chillies as you can, finely slice and salt them (one tablespoon per 250g). Refrigerate in a sealed container for three days, then blitz with cider vinegar (3 tbsp) and lemon juice (1 tbsp). In a new container, seal the paste with olive oil and keep in the fridge. Spoon over and into anything savoury to ramp up its flavour.The Too Good to Go app helps fight food waste. Customers buy a magic bag from a listed cafe or restaurant – maybe a chain like Yo! Sushi or an indie like us – filled with food that would have been binned. You can’t be too fussy. You might get meat, veg or a bag of cakes, and sometimes the bags are cancelled and refunded if places get busy. But you do get excellent deals. Our bags cost £3 for £9- or £10-worth of food. If you need inspiration for the contents, you can pick up some brilliant cookbooks second-hand for under a fiver. For example, Merry White’s Cooking for Crowds, Claudia Roden’s A New Book of Middle Eastern Food or Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall’s reliable River Cottage Veg Every Day.I was born in Manila, and Filipino cooking is a real combination of sweet and sour, often in the form of vinegar-based dipping sauces. At Bong Bong we use 7 Up (some Filipinos think it should be Sprite) in a sweet 24-hour pork-rib marinade. I presume this came from Americans in the Philippines during the second world war, who used Coke in BBQ marinades and that kind of thing. Ours is half-and-half 7 Up and soy sauce, plus garlic, ginger, chilli, sugar and fresh lemongrass, which creates good caramelisation and sweet, citrusy, fragrant ribs.I used expensive Japanese knives for years before an Aussie chef put me on to the Thai-brand Kiwi knives. They’re my go-to knives for daily prep – ultra-sharp, super-lightweight and with a very thin blade you can quickly put an edge on. You can pick them up for about £5.Buy 200g, ide into 10 cubes and freeze them inidually. As needed, stir one into a casserole, chilli, puy lentils or even a curry to give it a massive enhancement. At 40p a pop, it’s an incredibly cost-effective way to drive flavour into dishes.A squeeze of lemon will transform almost any food you can think of you need that balance of acidic tartness, even in a bolognese. A lemon is what, 30p? That’s the kind of cooking that real chefs do. You’ll notice the difference.I’m salt-obsessed, and this salt takes things to the next level. I add it to salads, roasted veg and cooked grains. Sprinkled over cauliflower roasted in curry powder, its smokiness makes the soft, charred cauliflower almost meaty-tasting. I’m French and both my grandmas use parsley all the time. It’s about 70p a bunch on Kirkgate Market and you can do amazing stuff with it. We use a lot of parsley sauce made with garlic, vinegar, mustard, oil, salt and pepper. You can put this vibrant green sauce on eggs, sandwiches, pasta or with fish. It keeps for five days in the fridge. I use this to jazz up pasta sauces. It’s pretty punchy. Blend a tin of chopped tomatoes with one heaped tablespoon of harissa until smooth, cook for 30 minutes on a medium heat, season with salt, add pasta, parsley and feta and you’ve got a delicious dinner.If you have a decent carbon-steel wok, ditch that wooden spoon and get a proper 14in plastic-handled stainless steel wok spatula, also known as a wok chuan or turner. Chinese supermarkets have them for about a fiver and because this shovel-like utensil is designed to fit the wok’s curves, it’s like having your own hand in there. It’s much easier to move things around and char them properly. I stock up on every type of lentil and pulse I can to make dhal. LSD, life-saving dhal, as the great Madhur Jaffrey calls it. I never get bored of it. Hodmedods’ British lentils and pulses have become a cheap, reliable store-cupboard essential for me. I love to fry onion, garlic and dried mint, then braise the lentils with a punctured dried Iranian lime and veg stock. Add tons of parsley and dill at the end. It’s such a nourishing, flavourful meal with bread or rice.My secret weapon. A salty, savoury sauce made from chillies and fermented soy beans, which I use instead of salt in a lot of food. I put it on everything. It tastes delicious stirred into cooked rice. I would recommend this to any home cook. After cutting freshly made gnocchi, you roll it softly across the board to score it, not just to make it pretty but also to create a better surface area for your pasta sauce to coat. This little board can also be used for different pastas as such garganelli and conchiglie.Marmite is essential in my cooking. Controversially, perhaps, I always add a teaspoon to the chicken broth in which I cook my goat meatballs. A dollop of this pungent, salty sauce in any meat or veggie dish, stock or stew adds a flavoursome punch.I buy my vegetables at Church Street Market, near Edgware Road, London. The traders sell bowls of veg for £1. You might get five aubergines in one or a couple of white cabbages, which I use to make sauerkraut in the winter. For £5 you can get a grade-A French black-legged chicken. On Fridays, there is a chap who sells squabs for £2.50. It’s first class.Most non-stick pans last three months if you’re lucky and might cost £35. We buy 50 Ikea ones at a time for £2.75 each. The non-stick only lasts weeks in a professional kitchen, but then we just use them as normal pans until they die. I’ve been doing this over 10 years. They used to be 79p!Just a teaspoon of Gentleman’s Relish can elevate a simple tomato sauce into something really special. Anchovy paste is a great way to add serious depth to your cooking."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72593e50bc052dd2d6241f8bc5bc65b20d021fe7/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=027e695cc1be833a0ebe65f30ce284d3","title":"lionel messi barcelona eric abidal patience snapped","story":"Nobody said it was easy, but nobody said it would be this hard. As for the problems, there are a lot. “It’s not normal to take over at a team that’s top,” Setién said when he arrived on 13 January but nor is it normal for so many things to happen so fast. And the scale of the latest problem – his captain and best player publicly calling out the sporting director – is yet to be fully gauged. The club’s president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, spoke to Eric Abidal and Lionel Messi on Wednesday, desperate to restore calm. After a long meeting, the decision was made to stick with Abidal.The day before Setién turned up, it was confirmed Luis Suárez needed an operation and would be out for three or four months. They sold two strikers, Carles Pérez and Abel Ruiz, to raise funds and make space for another but, having briefed that it was all tied up, they failed to sign one. Carles Aleñá had gone too, and Jean-Clair Todibo, and Moussa Wagué, but still they had not raised enough. No matter, Setién said, Ousmane Dembélé would be the “signing”: he was on his way back to full fitness and would be “flying”. Then the news broke that Dembélé had torn a tendon in his thigh and would miss the rest of the season.The squad are weaker, not stronger, than when Setién arrived this is not what he was sold. On Wednesday morning only 16 first‑team players were named to travel to face Athletic in Bilbao – and that is everyone they have got. Samuel Umtiti would have to make his own way there: he was wanted in court in the morning, accused of doing almost £170,000 worth of damage to a flat he was renting. At the weekend, Ivan Rakitic admitted he was unhappy at how Barcelona had tried to force him out. Arturo Vidal’s agents had already begun legal proceedings over a disputed bonus.And then, as if all that was not enough, on Tuesday night Abidal gave an interview to Sport. In it, he said he was optimistic Messi would sign a new deal and that Barça’s star player was happy at Camp Nou. But what he said in response to that question was eclipsed by what he said in response to others, which in turn changed the veracity of that statement.Abidal had suggested some of Barcelona’s players had been “unsatisfied” with the former manager Ernesto Valverde – responsible for this sacking, in other words. He also said they did not “work much”. For Messi, long assumed to wield power, the heaviest of dressing‑room heavyweights and invariably burdened with responsibility, the accusation was intolerable. It took less than 90 minutes from the first brief advance of the interview going live for Messi to react: it was public and unequivocal, the ision and resentment exposed.On Messi’s Instagram account a red circle was drawn around the quote: “Lots of players were not satisfied and nor did they work much.” Below it, Messi demanded Abidal take responsibility for his actions, accusing him of “dirtying” the players and challenging the sporting director to name names. Messi takes more responsibility than he should he was not going to take this one, too. Many thought he was right and even those who thought Abidal might be did not consider it a good idea to say so. The damage was done and it awoke the greatest fear: Messi leaving.Messi has a clause in his contract that allows him to leave at the end of the season – and for free. As Abidal admitted, all he has to do is communicate that in May. The 32-year-old has said repeatedly he wants to finish his career at Barcelona but has also said he wants to compete and over the past five years he has felt increasingly like Barça do not. Nor does he have long left: at December’s Ballon d’Or presentation for the first time he raised the question of retirement. There is a growing feeling his final years are being wasted and Messi is not immune to that feeling.Messi has not won the European Cup for five years. He has watched Barcelona fail to build around him – whether he is part of that problem is a broader, more complex question – and seen a generation slip into retirement and not be replaced. He has seen a lack of direction and certainty, four directors of sport and endless advisers under this regime. He has seen the president become vice-president as well and the team become weaker, despite spending €1,000m since the departure of Neymar. And now this. No wonder he snapped.Messi’s response does not come in isolation: there have been small signs of distrust everywhere, glimpses of the isions opening up, and not just from him. This is the player who stalled on posing for a photo with the president after his last contract renewal, as if reluctant to legitimise him the player who said the director Javier Faus, who had suggested there was no reason why Messi should get a new contract every year, “doesn’t know anything about football” who saw his friend Dani Alves suggest that, by leaving, he had delivered a deserved and “classy blow” to the board.Since Neymar left there has been a sense of the club reaching for something that has gone, desperate for a solution that never arrives. The only solution, it often felt, was Messi. He was a shield behind which many hid, a reason for complacency, conditioning everything. He wanted to share that burden, have a team constructed around him. Instead, he must have wondered what else he had to do, why it always seemed to come down to him. In the last few weeks even his best friend Suárez has been absent, with Messi cutting an even lonelier figure.This summer Messi watched his other great friend Neymar and Barcelona end up in court, even while they spent the summer supposedly courting each other. And then said: “I don’t know if the club did everything they could to sign him.” Messi wanted Neymar but he didn’t get that wish, however much they say he runs the place. The irony of course is that if the response is to sack Abidal, which it might be if only because the alternative is so awful, another short-term fix, it would reinforce the idea Messi is all powerful. Another fire to put out, sparked by Abidal’s hint that player power was too great.There is no player like Messi his reaction, at least, illustrates he felt the finger pointing at him and was not prepared to let it go. He asked for names: maybe some were not happy, maybe some were not working but do not look at me. And do not hide behind me, either. He has enough responsibility already to take on other people’s errors as his own, to be made a participant of the problems piling up since Setién arrived and well beyond that, failure delivered to his doorstep again. Above all, to be blamed for this mess.The AS journalist Santi Giménez on Wednesday offered a simple response to the accusation Messi runs Barcelona: if only."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be6e2cab96d34d2d56e022bcf4e3b08fb21974ee/352_0_3686_2212/master/3686.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89eb21a661691e994cc94531d86ea5c4","title":"tottenham southampton fa cup replay match report","story":"Tottenham’s motivation in hiring José Mourinho to replace Mauricio Pochettino was clear. They wanted the serial winner to guide them to silverware which, despite Pochettino’s excellence, has consistently eluded them. The drought pre-dated the Argentinian. Since the 1984 Uefa Cup, the club have won only three major trophies.Mourinho has viewed this season’s FA Cup through the prism of opportunity. If he can win it, maybe it will galvanise his tenure. When Danny Ings put Southampton 2-1 up in the 72nd minute of this fourth-round replay, the prospect of Spurs advancing to a home last-16 tie against Norwich was outlandish.Southampton had been the better team, particularly during a one-sided first-half. The cohesive football had belonged to them and so did the majority of the chances. Ralph Hasenhüttl’s tactics looked spot on and his players were stronger and quicker. They pressed with greater intensity. They seemed to be having fun.Yet Spurs found a way to dig deeper. They did not play particularly pretty football but in the end it was winning football and to Mourinho that was all that mattered. Lucas Moura swapped passes with Dele Alli to score with a fierce low shot, having skipped past a substitute, Jannik Vestergaard and, as extra time loomed, Alli – who came off the bench to make a difference – curled a wonderful pass through for Son Heung-min.He ran round the goalkeeper, Angus Gunn, who had hesitated before leaving his line, and everybody knew what was going to happen next. Gunn’s challenge was rash, Son went down and, in real time, it added up to a penalty for the referee, David Coote.The replays showed contact was minimal, restricted to Gunn catching Son with a hand. Was it sufficient to send him tumbling? Son did not care about the debate. He picked himself up to score the penalty and Southampton found their best efforts were undermined at the last. Mourinho said that the best team had lost but Hasenhüttl did not want compliments, he wanted progress.“It is not enough to dominate,” the Southampton manager said. “In the last 15 minutes we gave it away too easy. We didn’t defend well. I am not happy. It’s not about being the better team, it’s about being the winning team.”Mourinho, who complained that injuries had restricted his options, sprang the tactical surprise, starting with a back three and partnering Lucas with Son up front. It did not work and he switched to 4-2-3-1 early in the second half. Only when Alli began to exert an influence towards the end did Spurs come into the game.– Ties to be played week commencing 2 MarchTanguy Ndombele had helped to put Spurs in front, shooting for goal after Jack Stephens had stopped Ryan Sessegnon with a last-ditch challenge and watching the ball deflect heavily off the unfortunate Southampton defender to beat Gunn.It was tough on the visiting side, who might have taken the lead on two occasions. Ings took an excellent first touch to surge inside Jan Vertonghen but his shot was straight at Hugo Lloris – either side and he would have scored – while the Spurs goalkeeper appeared to misread a low shot from Nathan Redmond before saving with his trailing leg.Southampton advertised the equaliser. Ings rattled the crossbar after getting in behind the creaking Vertonghen and Lloris parried weakly from Ryan Bertrand’s long-range effort. The goalkeeper got away with that one. He would not be so lucky in the 34th minute. Sofiane Boufal found space and fed Redmond, who spun and shot for the far post. When Lloris pushed it out, Shane Long was all alone to sweep home.Spurs were poor on the defensive cover and there were other instances of them giving up too much space, particularly in the areas between the wide centre-backs and the wing-backs. They did not move the ball with any conviction until the closing stages and their final decisions were poor. Southampton lost James Ward-Prowse to a grisly-looking knee injury but it did not affect their rhythm. Happily, the post-match update was positive, revealing only a deep cut.Boufal miscued when gloriously placed after a burst from Ings on 50 minutes and Mourinho had seen enough. He swapped Vertonghen for Gedson Fernandes and changed his formation and, shortly afterwards, he sent on Alli for Ndombele. Vertonghen looked devastated and he brooded darkly on the bench, while Ndombele faded badly after a driving and trick-filled start.Although Son broke and crossed for Lucas who headed wide – a big chance wasted – it was Southampton who hogged possession and controlled the tempo. It was difficult to isolate any star performer for them it was a team display in the truest sense.Vestergaard extended Lloris with a header from a corner and it was no surprise when Southampton took the lead. What a goal it was, Long’s clearing header from inside his own box releasing Redmond and the forward tearing into Spurs territory, skating past three opponents, before findings Ings, who stepped inside Japhet Tanganga and finished. Game over? It looked that way. Somehow Mourinho found a way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce719a4e756c4bca8b374b024fbc6597e7c800bf/4_806_4778_2867/master/4778.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d615c84f1c00c8a668f0bb3995209430","title":"new sesame street show brings muppet magic to refugee camps","story":"Three new Muppets, Basma, Jad, and Ma’zooza, will star in new show for the millions of children displaced across the Middle EastCooperation, kindness and the alphabet. For over 50 years, the characters of Sesame Street, from the Cookie Monster to Big Bird, have helped children from erse backgrounds navigate the challenges of life as a small person in a big world.From the moment it launched, Sesame Street has unflinchingly dealt with difficult issues – and from this week they are bringing their special brand of magic to the children who need them the most.Ahlan Simsim (“Welcome Sesame” in Arabic) will premiere on regional children’s television as well as on YouTube – created for the displaced and traumatised refugee children living in Syria, Jordan, Iraq and Lebanon.The show is part of a major humanitarian programme designed to bring play and laughter to children suffering long term displacement as the Syrian war continues to create new refugees daily. Scott Cameron, executive producer at Sesame Workshop, told the  that the team worked with educational experts and psychologists across the region.“There will be content in there that is particularly relevant to refugee children, but we wanted to identify story lines that will appeal to all children. All of our advisors recommended identifying and managing emotions. Unless you create a strong foundation to talk about how you are feeling, and how to identify emotions like anger and sadness, then it’s difficult to deal with other crucial goals like how to understand others perspectives.“So we looked at how to help children aged three to eight deal with emotions. For example, when looking at fear we have an episode where Basma is scared of the dark. That is a good way to talk about being afraid because so many children are scared of the dark.”There are plans to use the work and the puppets to do far-reaching work in communities across the Middle East. But Cameron emphasises that play must underpin all the work done for these vulnerable children.“It is our job to educate, but it’s also our job to bring joy and laughter. All of the research shows that play helps develop emotional resilience as well as educational attainment.”Marianne Stone, programme director at the International Rescue Committee (IRC), which has partnered with Sesame Workshop to run the programme, said the show is urgently needed to help children who are suffering during a key stage in their development.“Children who suffer the daily effects of violence and neglect are at high risk for experiencing toxic stress, a disruption of neurological and biological processes due to severe, prolonged stress and the absence of nurturing care.“Children who experience toxic stress during critical stages of brain development are at severe risk for impairments that will follow them throughout their lives.”The show will focus on identifying and managing emotions, and is part of a wider child-centred intervention, with thousands of outreach workers going to clinics, community centres, homes and other gathering spaces in the four countries to work on the lessons discussed in the programmes.The show follows five-year-old Muppet best friends Basma and Jad and a friendly goat called Ma’zooza as they experience and discuss troubling emotions. Each time, Basma and Jad learn to manage their feelings by using strategies such as counting to five, belly breathing, and expression through art. The second half of each episode is a variety show segment, when real kids and celebrity guests join the characters to play games and sing songs that reinforce the episode’s educational content.Since Syria erupted into conflict in 2011, more than 5 million children have become refugees, with huge numbers living in camps across neighbouring countries. There are massive gaps in the provision of both early years support and education for these children, many of whom are suffering the traumatic effects of witnessing extreme violence. Sesame Street is known for helping children deal with the varied problems of childhood through onscreen characters and storylines.In 2017, the team introduced a new character to its ranks – a Muppet called Julia, who has autism.

But their efforts have often been frustrated, mostly for a more fundamental reason than the technological barrier in place since August: they believe the aid community sent to help them is not listening.“The Rohingya community are not weak, but the situation makes us weak,” says Mohammad Arfaat, an activist who was part of a Rohingya team that made a short film about how violence had forced them from Myanmar in 2017.He has been calling for more help for Rohingya to launch their own initiatives, for everything from education to arts, but complains there has been no support. “The Rohingya youth are very talented … but nobody sits, nobody talks with them, so their voices have stopped,” says Arfaat.These concerns have risen since August, when Bangladesh responded to a failed attempt to repatriate the Rohingya – for which not a single refugee volunteered – by imposing tighter restrictions on their movement and communication.Arfaat says that, despite the crackdown, UN agencies and international aid groups have not been present.Lack of education has been a particularly pressing concern among Rohingya activists, who have campaigned for years against a government ban on all but the most basic level of schooling, warning of a “lost generation”.They won a victory last month when Bangladesh announced a pilot programme to teach children between 11 and 13 the Myanmar curriculum. Rohingya teachers and activists had little knowledge of how the plan would work, however.The restrictions have been in place since the existing camps were established in 1991, when the same fears about future generations prompted Rohingya who had been educated in Myanmar to set up their own independent learning centres in secret, funded by small monthly contributions from parents.Similar models have become more prevalent since 2017, when the Kutupalong refugee camp became the world’s largest as it absorbed the hundreds of thousands of people who fled a Myanmar military operation described by the UN as having “genocidal intent”.Activist Khin Maung says that despite three decades of Rohingya experience in the refugee camps, their expertise is not tapped by humanitarian workers.He complains that organisations implementing education projects often employ underqualified tutors who teach only basic phrases and nursery rhymes, failing to utilise the talents of refugees.A 2019 study by the Peace Research Institute Oslo said that, despite the barriers imposed on the humanitarian community by the government’s education ban, more could have been done to map out the work carried out by Rohingya themselves.“The humanitarian sector often falls short on centring community voices in this way, which I think is due in part to policy restrictions, limited resources and a lack of flexibility,” says the report’s co-author Jessica Olney.“It’s also due to quick staff turnaround, as many humanitarian staff are new to the Rohingya community and aren’t encouraged or permitted by their agencies to spend time in the camps just talking to people and listening to gain a deep understanding of the context and people’s needs.”The relationship between the Rohingya and the humanitarian community has been strained by a recent government order to stop paying refugee volunteers in cash, which the authorities claim is used to buy false documents. The government has encouraged the hiring of Bangladeshis instead.Refugees claim they have been removed from volunteer roles, which typically pay a daily stipend of less than £3, which forces them to rely solely on the aid supply of oil, lentils and rice.NGOs operating in the area claim “miscommunication” was a reason some Rohingya had been dismissed.“There is a major communication breakdown between some international humanitarian organisations and the Rohingya refugee volunteers about why they are being dismissed,” says John Quinley, human rights specialist for the advocacy group Fortify Rights, which has documented the dismissals.There was a similar outcry by refugees when the UN refugee agency, the UNHCR, signed an agreement with Myanmar on repatriating the Rohingya in 2018. Refugees said they were not consulted on that deal, or about a system for biometric registration.A spokesperson for the UNHCR says the agency used several methods to share information with refugees and engage community leaders, including face-to-face meetings, drama performances and podcasts.The spokesperson adds: “The Rohingya refugee population in Cox’s Bazar is more than 850,000 people. This alone presents a challenge in terms of ensuring that all voices are heard. Furthermore, to communicate effectively with a very large population requires the utilisation of technology. Currently, this presents challenges in Cox’s Bazar due to restrictions on mobile connectivity.“UNHCR works to ensure that refugees are consulted on key issues and are involved in decision-making processes including through regular protection monitoring and profiling, as well as community outreach. Refugees should be consulted on all issues related to their daily lives and not only significant political developments.”Maung says the role played by refugees in the humanitarian response over the past two years, from volunteering as translators to other key roles, has been underestimated.“They ignore us but without Rohingya involvement they can’t do anything in the camps, they can’t even understand us properly. They don’t know our language,” he says. “We are the nuts and bolts.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c29485a681aece9e0a950b3b283747638d0a8309/0_702_6184_3711/master/6184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9bfd6d19609445c9ea26fcfdd9c6beb","title":"tell us about the pressures men are under to have children","story":"We would like to hear from men who are feeling under pressure to have children by a certain ageSome men feel pressure to have children by a certain age.

Amazon’s Choice highlights highly rated, well-priced products that are available to ship immediately. Amazon’s Choice is our choice for a product we think customers may like, and customers can always shop for any brand or product that they want to purchase.“We don’t tolerate Amazon policy violations such as review abuse, incentivised reviews, counterfeits or unsafe products. When deciding to badge a product as Amazon’s Choice, we proactively incorporate a number of factors that are designed to protect customers from those policy violations. When we identify a product that may not meet our high bar for products we highlight for customers, we remove the badge.”Amazon has faced increasing criticism for the lack of quality control on its site. The company earns an increasing amount of its revenue through “marketplace” sales, for which it provides its platform and offers minimal oversight, and it has altered its site in a way that blurs the distinction between those sales and products bought directly from Amazon itself.A  investigation in 2018 found that the site was awash with counterfeit goods as a result, with fake streetwear, electronics and makeup on sale as the genuine items. A year later, the Wall Street Journal found “thousands of banned, unsafe or mislabelled products” being sold on the site by third-party sellers, ranging from sleeping mats that had been banned over fears they would suffocate infants to motorcycle helmets falsely listed as government-certified. “Dozens of products the Journal identified as dangerous or mislabeled had the Amazon’s Choice designation,” the newspaper said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b81993fdd8b2b80449dc3ccb85de285cfd06c59a/0_182_3117_1870/master/3117.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=accffafdc1cee092a7c08a09ce1dc14e","title":"us elections the importance of iowa podcast","story":"Chris McGreal visits the first US state to vote in this year’s race for the Democratic party’s presidential nomination.

Or Baroness Morgan of Cotes as she now insists on being called by family and staff alike. Not even Nicky addresses herself as Nicky any more. Some people are born great, some achieve greatness and some have mediocrity thrust upon them.On a rare day out among the great unwashed, her ladyship dropped in to the right-of-centre thinktank Policy Exchange to share her thoughts about the BBC. Well, not her thoughts exactly – Nicky has never knowingly had any of her own – but she was more than happy to pass on some of Boris Johnson’s. Any enemy of the prime minister’s was an enemy of hers.“You need to change with the times if you want to stay relevant,” she informed the BBC, her voice laced with misplaced superiority. At least here the culture secretary was on solid ground. Because this is exactly the same attitude she has taken to her own principles.A year or so ago, Morgan appeared to be on the way out. A backbench MP who was being cold-shouldered for repeatedly holding her government to account over its mismanagement of Brexit. Something had to give, and that something was what passed for Nicky’s conscience. Almost overnight she became a passionate leaver, dedicated to doing anything – including recruiting hundreds of SAS-trained badgers to patrol the Irish border – in pursuit of rebuilding her career.But it wasn’t Brexit that really sealed the deal for Morgan. What secured her a place in government was effortlessly closing down the investigation into Boris’s financial dealings with Jennifer Arcuri before it had even got under way. Since then, Nicky has been astonished to discover that baubles keep tumbling into her lap as if from heaven. All she has to do is be tirelessly loyal. To Boris, if not to herself.As ever, Morgan delivered her speech with the air of the perpetually startled. It would be nice to imagine this was her subconscious at work, that deep down she has a conscience and can scarcely believe some of the stuff she is now saying or how she got to where she is now. The truth, though, is almost certainly more prosaic. She’s just a bit out of her depth reading out some other person’s words.On and on she plodded. She loved the BBC – as in she couldn’t give a toss about it one way or the other – but it should be following the Netflix model of going £10bn in debt rather than being funded by a licence fee. So the government was going to do whatever it took to put those pinko, remainer bastards at the Beeb out of business.By the way, she added as a closing thought, the BBC needed to be more transparent and accountable. This from a minister who doesn’t understand the meaning of democracy, having secured her position in the cabinet by lying to her constituents and helping herself to a peerage. And a government that refuses to engage with either the Today programme or ITV’s Good Morning Britain, bans journalists from the prime minister’s speeches and excludes half the lobby from press briefings. Luckily Nicky is so lacking in self-awareness she doesn’t notice the irony.Still, it’s hard not to feel a little bit of sympathy with Nicky. At least she has been on a journey towards becoming a total sellout. So there must once have been a thread of decency in her. A glimpse of humanity, long since buried, that could – unlikely I know – resurface one day.The prime minister of course is totally untroubled by any such sensitivities, having always been profoundly morally bankrupt. Which makes life so much easier for him. Watching Boris at PMQs these days is a case study in unfiltered narcissism and sociopathy. Past prime ministers have gone to great lengths to disguise such dysfunctionality but Johnson actively glories in it. Labour has given up on itself, Jeremy Corbyn has given up on himself, and so Boris feels himself free to do whatever he wants. Boris Unplugged. A combination of vanity, arrogance and the boredom, tinged with disappointment, that comes from having achieved all his ambitions. He had only ever wanted to become prime minister. He’d never wanted to be prime minister. As with his attitude to women, the thrill had only ever been in the chase.Corbyn mumbled a few questions about the climate crisis that could have been challenging if delivered by someone rather more interested and quick-witted. As it was, Boris merely shrugged off his own climate emergency denial credentials and invented a few statistics about carbon emissions and economic growth. All of which were totally untrue, but which no one thought to question. Labour MPs because they are now totally comatose and Conservative MPs because there’s no need. They know he’s a liar. But he’s their liar.Having insulted the Scottish National party for no good reason – other than because they were there and he could – Boris then failed to answer questions from his own side on Huawei before ending by saying he loved journalists and was committed to democracy. Both of which he went on to demonstrate by bypassing the media with yet another edition of his online “people’s PMQs” in which he was free to answer questions that Classic Dom had written for him.Even then, it was a mess. A combination of unchallenged untruths bookended by pointless rambles about nothing very much, just to fill the dead air. You could sense that even Boris was overwhelmed by his own futility. But as an exhibition of contempt, it could hardly be improved upon. We’re so lucky to have him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6fcb62e3476d2aed67a71ea89e0f993a05159af/0_69_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3aba2702816c4db2e26a335a62d0ced3","title":"max verstappen lewis hamilton f1 red bull","story":"The Red Bull principal, Christian Horner, believes Max Verstappen is the driver most likely to challenge Lewis Hamilton for the Formula One world championship this year.Horner is bullish about his team’s chances but reckons Hamilton, who will be aiming for a seventh world crown, will remain with Mercedes rather than switch to Ferrari at the end of the season.Verstappen, 22 but entering his sixth F1 season, is convinced he is ready to take the fight to the British driver. Red Bull have not properly challenged Hamilton’s dominant Mercedes team since the turbo‑hybrid era began.However, with the regulations stable, Horner is confident that if Red Bull deliver on their car his Dutch driver can be a threat.Last year Verstappen won three races and finished third in the drivers’ standings. Red Bull improved as the season progressed, as did their Honda engine, Verstappen closing out with four podiums from the final seven races. Expectations are high at Red Bull that they will start in their strongest position since 2014.Hamilton was explicit last year that he gave Verstappen room on track, given the Dutchman’s propensity for aggressive manoeuvres, which Horner insisted is one of Verstappen’s assets. “Any driver knows that Max will have a go,” he said. “He is aggressive but he is also calculating in that aggression.“We didn’t see many incidents last year at all. Even in Monaco he was still prepared to have a go, he wasn’t prepared to sit and settle for second place. It’s not in his DNA: his modus operandi is absolutely flat out and go for it.”Hamilton’s Mercedes contract is running down and he has been linked with a move to Ferrari but Horner expects him to remain with the team with whom he has won five of his six titles.“Bernie Ecclestone always used to say drivers want to end their career at Ferrari. I think that might be different in Lewis’s case. He has been unconventional throughout his career. He seems happy in the environment he is in. If it is the most competitive environment why would he want to change that for the sake of driving in a different car?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88944abba122485af1bbcadbab61a324bb2ee3eb/1027_1999_2593_1556/master/2593.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2417529e1f7e83f7bfe11fc1cd43402","title":"nike air zoom alphafly next shoe","story":"Just days after World Athletics belatedly introduced regulations to limit running shoe technology, Nike has courted further controversy with one that slips inside the rules and then hailing it as another “gamechanger”.But the new shoes, which look more like a platform boot than a traditional racing flat, will upset rival brands and athletes who believe it amounts to “technical doping” because Nike is using special foam and a carbon plate to create shoes that allow runners to go much faster than their competitors. Two sources who have tried the Alphaflys said they were ridiculously quick, with one adding that “even a little effort pushes you more forward than a regular shoe”.Both also confirmed they are much quicker than the Nike Vaporfly, which have revolutionised marathon running since being introduced in 2016. Over the past 18 months Kipchoge and Brigid Kosgei have set men’s and women’s world records in versions of the shoe.That will raise eyebrows. However Nike said the Alphafly will be legal when it is released this summer. The company say its shoe has only one carbon fibre plate and a sole thickness of 39.5mm, which means it comes under the 40mm limit set last Friday by World Athletics.According to the Wall Street Journal, Nike will also offer the shoe in limited quantities online by the end of the month, meaning it will also meet World Athletics’s requirement for new shoes to be available to the public by April in order to be eligible for the Tokyo Olympics starting in July.The Nike vice-president, Tony Bignell, claimed World Athletics’s new rules had forced it to think differently, despite the regulations being only a week old. “Barriers are inspiring to innovators,” he said. “Like athletes, when a barrier is in front of us we are challenged to think differently and push gamechanging progress in footwear design.”Rival brands are known to be frustrated by the number of patents Nike has taken out on its shoe technology, which makes it hard for anyone else to catch up. Last week the New Balance executive, Tom Carleo, said his company had developed shoes with technical foams and carbon fibre plates but it was “very concerned by the fact that these rules were adopted without meaningful consultation involving sporting goods industry representatives and companies”.Nike has also launched a new Viperfly sprint shoe, designed for the 100m, which does not meet World Athletics’ new regulations. The company said it would now be working to modify the shoe for use."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c254f4d97b9c675fa1dea6f9b5294267ea444b9/0_103_2616_1570/master/2616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9742d4cba4426d9b6df335263cf2b69d","title":"scotland england 1990 grand slam rmurrayfield six nations rugby union","story":"Scotland host England on Saturday but whatever the result at Murrayfield it is unlikely to match the fervour of their famous win 30 years agoEven now, 30 years on, memories of Scotland’s tumultuous 1990 grand-slam triumph over England have the power to move those involved to tears. Iwan Tukalo is recounting the team talk delivered by Scotland’s revered coaching double-act of Ian McGeechan and Jim Telfer at their hotel before heading to Murrayfield. It was, he believes, the “defining moment” when hope was infused with conviction they could topple Will Carling’s England and seize European rugby’s biggest prize themselves.“Normally it was a little bit like being back at school, with the teachers – the coaches – at the front and then our chairs set out in rows,” the former wing says. “This time all the seats were in a circle and on the front of each chair was a jersey but you couldn’t see the numbers, just the thistle. They said: ‘Come in, just sit anywhere.’“At the end he said: ‘There is a jersey on the front of your chair pick that jersey up and give it to the person it belongs to and make a commitment to them’.” At this point Tukalo, now 58, pauses to wipe away a tear. “Sorry, but that’s how powerful it was, it still has that emotion.” On Tukalo’s chair was the No 6 jersey belonging to the flanker John Jeffrey. “I just said: ‘JJ, there’s your jersey, I won’t let you down.’ For me, after that, nobody was going to beat us that day.”Saturday’s latest Calcutta Cup passion play will not lack for intrigue as both countries plot a route back from opening defeats – Scotland in Dublin, England in Paris – but even were a grand slam still on the line, it is doubtful the emotional pitch would reach 1990 levels. The patriotic fervour swirling round Murrayfield was fuelled by the political backdrop, with many Scots none too impressed at being used as a testing ground for Margaret Thatcher’s hated poll tax before its imminent introduction south of the border.If England were characterised in the buildup as the embodiment of this arrogance and brutality, the Scots, billeted in the Braid Hills hotel on the outskirts of Edinburgh, were “oblivious” to the off-field noise until the day of the match, according to Tukalo, who was sharing a room with the captain, David Sole.“Soley is not the most talkative of iniduals. The nerves were jangling and there was a deathly silence. So I said: ‘Do you mind if I put the TV on?’ It just so happened the opening credits of Grandstand came on. There was every Scotland-England sporting event that had ever happened, not just rugby but football, boxing and everything else. It only lasted a couple of minutes and then there was silence. We looked at each other and just went: ‘Fuuuuck!’ That’s when it hit home.”England’s dominant form in the Championship made them favourites. Scotland earned narrow wins in Dublin and Cardiff but a 21-0 home victory over France bolstered confidence, as did the recall of only their second ever grand slam six years earlier, to the day, 17 March. Coincidentally, Telfer’s birthday.“I was there when Jim Calder scored his try in ’84 against France,” says Tukalo, who is behind plans to reunite Scotland’s 1984 and 1990 squads at a unique charity dinner in May. “When it was our turn to have the opportunity, to know it was achievable, those guys were an inspiration.”Home fires were stoked further when Scotland ran out to warm up and found the England players’ girlfriends being interviewed on the pitch. “Talk about red rag to a bull,” Tukalo says. “‘You are on our turf, you have got no effing right to be there until the day is done.”Scotland’s slow walk out for the kick-off, led by Sole, is enshrined in rugby folklore. Tukalo believes its origins lay in their annual trial match two years previously, when Gary Callander, who led the “reds” against the more established “blues”, used it as motivation. “Gary said: ‘We are not Christians at the Colosseum being led to the slaughter. We’re going to walk out there with purpose’. It resonated.”Finlay Calder, Jim’s twin brother and a victorious Lions captain in Australia in 1989, harboured doubts about the plan. “I wasn’t really buying into it because you can look helluva foolish,” says the former flanker. “I did it for the first Test with the Lions and we got murdered but I played along and it worked out fine, didn’t it? The whole idea was to destabilise them. It was a bit of gamesmanship. I can still remember when we walked out. It was a sense of there is a big fight on the cards.” A spine-tingling moment on a day full of them. “It must have rattled the England players,” Tukalo says. “The noise was off the scale.”It went up several notches more when Tony Stanger, Scotland’s other wing, reached Gavin Hastings’ kick first to score the decisive try. Calder was alongside him, arms wide in celebration. The euphoria around Murrayfield reverberated far and wide, and not just in rugby circles.“One of my work colleagues was a Dundee United supporter and was at Tannadice on the day,” says Tukalo, then a distribution engineer with British Gas. “He said people suddenly started jumping up and down and it was like a Mexican wave making its way to the centre of the stand. When it reached the PA announcer, he said: ‘Scotland have defeated England at Murrayfield.’ The whole place erupted.”Tickets for the grand-slam reunion event are available at heartsandballs.org.uk"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d0c7fb5a0d23e2bda02bef05a51e9049709d0b4/0_63_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0fc0ba43e328fe5035d120bfeee14f9","title":"six nations broadcasting rights cvc deal","story":"It is understood the outcome may hinge on whether the two sides can compromise on a hybrid package involving one match per round being screened on subscription television.The current agreement with BBC and ITV, which is worth £90m a year, ends in 2022 and the tender process for the new contract is due to start this month, although the talks with CVC may still be continuing then. For CVC, broadcasting holds the difference between a healthy return on the £300m investment and a modest one.“We have not set a deadline,” said Benjamin Morel, the Six Nations chief executive, “but I would expect that we will reach a decision within a matter of weeks rather than months. The talks have been constructive but negotiations like this take time because there are a number of complicated issues to deal with. We are always looking at ways of attracting investment, but it is important that we retain control.”The Six Nations is in Group B of the government’s listed sporting events for broadcasting, which guarantees free-to-air broadcasters secondary rights. The home unions have resisted attempts to have the tournament upgraded to Group A, which would put it out of reach of pay TV, arguing that doing so would drive down the price.Morel joined the Six Nations in November 2018 and at last year’s tournament launch expressed his support for it remaining on what he called “free-to-view” television. A few weeks later, the match between Wales and England in Cardiff attracted a peak audience of nearly nine million on the BBC, almost half the available television audience.The tournament has become a national event and the home unions are concerned that if the BBC and ITV lost the contract to a subscription rival the subsequent drop in the sport’s profile would not be worth the extra money generated by a deal.CVC will be loth to leave the Six Nations with the power of veto over the TV contract, but taking all the matches away from free-to-air would lead to a public outcry and put pressure on the government to add the tournament to the Group A list.CVC wants to aggregate the commercial rights of the six unions, bundling November internationals and the Six Nations together to achieve a maximum return.

She talks about finding hope in a violent dystopia‘You’re in a world in which you are effectively at war with nature,” says Jessica Hynes, slurping noodles on her lunch break, “and nature is at war with itself.” Hynes is in rehearsals for the Donmar’s revival of Caryl Churchill’s dystopian Far Away, in which love is strangled at every turn by violence, oceans take sides in humanity’s battles and children’s curiosity is crushed when they ask why older generations aren’t rushing to put out the fires they’ve made. “It’s exquisite,” Hynes says of the prophetic text, first staged in 2000 at the Royal Court. “She’s a legend for good reason.”Hynes made her name starring in the cult TV comedy Spaced, which she co-wrote with Simon Pegg. She won a Bafta in 2015 for the BBC parody W1A and again in 2019 for the disability-focused drama There She Goes most recently she played a radiation-riddled activist in Russell T Davies’ devastating Years and Years. Far Away, which she describes as “a kind of poem”, is her first Churchill play.Its landscape is a putrid one. The short three-act structure follows Joan and Todd who work at a hat factory, creating extravagant artefacts under the watchful eye of a fearsome dictatorial government. Violence seeps into the everyday as secrets and lies amass, and by the end of the play, every sentient being on Earth is engaged in conflict. “It’s artful and stylistic in some ways,” says Hynes of Churchill’s writing, “but also incredibly natural and almost perfunctory, even though what is really going on is shocking.”Hynes plays Joan’s morally woozy aunt, Harper, who disguises human screams as owl’s shrieks and piles up lies to hide the bloodstains. “Everyone thinks they’re the good guy,” Hynes says of the character’s morality. “Everyone believes that what they’re doing is for the right reasons.” In a 2016 interview, Hynes said the trait she most deplored in others was dishonesty in Harper, she has a character whose natural state is to lie. “It’s more complicated than honesty or dishonesty,” she says. “I’m trying to find her humanity, even when it feels like inhumanity.”Though never ascribed to a particular struggle, Churchill wrote the play in 2000, at the time of the Serbian conflict. “But its brilliance is in the fact that you could take it anywhere,” Hynes says. “It could be 2,000 years in the future or 1,000 years in the past.”This production draws out the focus on the environment, with the war on nature bought to the fore. Plants and animals are weaponised and ided the ants side with the Moroccans and the weather joins the fight of the Japanese. It is both a rage against inaction and a shrug against the inevitability of violence stemming from an uncaring, eco-damaging capitalist system. “Normal people are never really the perpetrators,” Hynes figures. “They are the victims of circumstance, of the wider chaos of war.”Hynes is best known for her comedy, so it feels strange to sit with her and talk earnestly about destruction. Though there is absurdity in Far Away, both in the language (“The cats have come in on the side of the French”) and the action (in the infamous parade scene), the show is not played for laughs. “We’re trying to honour the script completely,” she says, “and do something that feels as faithful and truthful and open as we can make it.”Harper begins the play by talking about how beautiful the owls are outside her windows, but fast-forward a few years and she sees violence in every wing of a bird or blade of grass. As audience members, we skip the distance between these viewpoints. “We talked about what might have happened in that middle act,” Hynes explains, “to make that slowly encroaching ravaged landscape, with more grief, more loss, more violence, more struggle.” In the first scene, director Lyndsey Turner has Harper weaving a quilt of a natural landscape, building up an image of what is beginning to break down around them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b44615c122e821e84ede767a88d2ed018cfd0c9/0_164_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c3ecfea4c5018cebd8c2a0f8644155b","title":"the rise of facial recognition technology podcast","story":"Facial recognition technology is getting more sophisticated each year and is now being used commercially as identification instead of passwords as well as being adopted by the politan police in London.

Danny McBride’s HBO comedy, centred on the astonishing world of US megachurches and the extremely wealthy people who run them, opens with a 24-hour baptism marathon in China, as 5,000 converts line up to be dunked. Overseen by John Goodman’s towering patriarch Eli, the Gemstone brothers, Jesse (played by McBride) and Kelvin (the elastic-faced Adam DeVine), are unable to stop bickering even in this most spiritual of moments. They splash each other. Then the wave machine comes on, and with it, disco lights and a thumping EDM soundtrack. In the name of this father and these sons, the holy spirit is lacking.As a concept, God, guns and theme parks should provide rich material. Across the US south, the Gemstones have built arena-sized places of worship and reaped the rewards, living in grotesque excess as the tithes keep rolling in. One scene in particular shows that this is a lucrative business after Eli has preached the importance of donations, to “save 5,000 Chinese souls”, we cut to the backstage area, which looks like an outtake from The Sopranos, as the many money-counting machines get to work on the piles of cash.Like any TV family, the Gemstones are deeply dysfunctional. Eli is mourning his wife, Aimee-Lee, with whom he built his empire in the 80s, and the throwback footage of the pair’s televangelist days is one of the highlights of the first episode. Without her, the family is falling apart. The three children exist on a sliding scale between intellectually challenged and amoral. Judy, a fun turn by Vice Principals’ Edi Patterson, is sidelined by the men, no matter how desperate she is to thrive. “Flying around on private planes being leaders, that’s men’s business,” Jesse tells her. Kelvin lives with a mullet-toting former Satanist called Keefe with whom he shares extended homoerotic moments, and Kelvin’s devotion to a deep-V T-shirt is almost as strong as his devotion to the big man upstairs. Jesse has a solid family of his own – give or take a wayward son – yet is the worst of the bunch, lacking in decency, convinced of his own superiority without any apparent justification, a blustering and unapologetic and gruesomely entitled man. In an attempt to extort $1m from the Gemstone empire, he is sent a video that shows him snorting cocaine while naked women dance around him. But even as the mysterious blackmailer explains Jesse’s hypocrisy to him, he still insists he is a man of the Lord.If this doesn’t sound all that funny, then the problem is that at this stage, it isn’t. Despite the bits of slapstick – a baptismal upset here, a penis on a scurrilous video there, Keefe’s enormous 666 tattoo – it is short on laughs. It seems keen not to take potshots at the easy targets, despite the rich array of absurdity that this level of evangelical Christianity offers, and it is just respectful enough to blunt the comedy somewhat.When it came out in the US last summer, a number of reviews noted its similarity to Succession – a cold, ruthless and unloving patriarch trying to protect his empire, children who cannot possibly live up to their father’s name, the corruption of extreme wealth and greed. There’s even a character like that show’s Tom, in the form of Judy’s hapless outsider fiance, BJ. (The standout moment is a family meal that descends into chaos, as BJ laments the “regressive” family, “always keeping women in the shadows”, to which Jesse’s wife, Amber, replies: “Do you know what I think?”, before pausing for permission – “I’m sorry, can I talk?”) Comparing anything to Succession, a series at the very top of its game, is always going to be unfavourable for the show that is not Succession, but it does demonstrate just how skilled that show is at demanding and nurturing our investment in awful people. At the moment, The Righteous Gemstones simply lacks the depth.However, after almost an entire episode of world-building, it does threaten to go somewhere far more interesting. Goodman is terrifying as Eli, who is moving the family in on new territory. While smiling at the “brother pastors” whose churches existed long before his, he calmly explains his plans to swallow them up. In this world, the meek shall not inherit the Earth. Dermot Mulroney is Johnny Seasons, one of those pastors, a seemingly humble man who looks as if he will become the Gemstones’ nemesis. Yet it’s the blackmail plot that eventually explodes into life, kick-starting the action and hinting at a darker season to come.McBride has talked about how people raved about his earlier show Eastbound \u0026amp Down, but not enough of them actually watched it, despite the cult love it continues to inspire. For the bulk of this opener, The Righteous Gemstones hovers cautiously, without ever quite finding the strength of its voice. But it clearly has the potential to be much more. I’m praying for these Gemstones to shine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e57533578598a1d5dcb9e87137f9e0b87cab4539/0_90_1475_885/master/1475.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e73e7a3967519b80a6110e9f9b11957d","title":"the irrepressible joy of australian news bloopers from distressingly human to extremely bird","story":"International news bloopers tend to be small slips in a ruthless professional operation. But when they happen in Australia, they’re phenomenalThere’s nothing so compelling as watching things go wrong. This is especially true in a world as serious and self-important as broadcast news. It’s the moment where we peel back the facade, the limelight fades and suddenly the slick and confident hosts become as scared and human as the rest of us.The Australian news blooper is a unique beast in itself. Internationally, bloopers are mostly slips of the tongue or unintentionally funny graphics. A small slip in a ruthlessly professional operation. An Australian blooper, on the other hand, is closer to the kind of fiasco you’d usually associate with a school theatre production where the backdrops crash to the ground and Peter Pan is left dangling helplessly forever. Indeed, sometimes this is much more literal than you’d think.It’s important to define what counts as a blooper. Former opposition leader Tony Abbott’s central processing unit melting during a live interview, leaving him gawping like a goldfish, was unbelievably weird but it’s not a blooper.Equally, morning sewerage delivery service Sunrise’s baffling choice to force a clearly uncomfortable Kristin Davis into playing out their Sex and the City fan fiction and the acid trip that was the Reject the Recession dancers had, remarkably, been planned. Granted, those plans were made by people who work in the world of breakfast television which is as damaging to the mind as taking an anvil to the skull – but nevertheless, they aren’t bloopers.As for what does count as a blooper? To steal a quote from former supreme court justice Potter Stewart talking about pornography: “I know it when I see it.” And these are the ones that you simple can’t unsee.The best bloopers are the ones that show consummate professional newsreaders as almost human.Whether they’re caught out not paying attention:Locked in a petty argument:Being casually destroyed in the usually bland banter:Or even revealing a powerful thirst when they didn’t realise the camera is rolling:The most painfully human moment of all. This disaster.A great tradition of breakfast television is attempting to liven up literally talking about the weather by putting the presenter in mortal peril.Sunrise had a young Grant Denyer pass out in a stunt plane:The Today Show’s Stevie Jacobs was bitten on the butt by a pelican:Why do this? Simply put, when left to their own devices, presenters will break a child’s toy in front of them. They can’t be trusted:The perfect scream emitted by Stevie Jacobs when he was attacked by a different bird.For years now, Australian news has been openly at war with all birds. It’s common enough that it is deserving of its own category.Birds have harassed reporters trying to present live crosses:And revealed that Channel Nine legend Peter Hitchener is actually the size of a potato chip:But the reporters are far from innocent, particularly when they hook and reel in a duck on live television:Come on. It’s Stevie Jacobs being scared by the chicken again. You cannot see it enough.In a world of neighbours from hell, dodgy plumbers and men who bark like dogs, it’s hard to know what actually counts as a blooper on tabloid news:But if I had to guess, I’d say mistakenly announcing the Queen stepping down in 2017 would count:Also, having the cameras themselves turn against you would, too:Let’s not overthink this. Last month a A Current Affair reporter was sprayed in the crotch with a hose. Immature? Yes. Indisputably funny? Also yes.Perhaps it’s cruel to laugh at these small moments. The high stakes of live broadcast television make the slightest mistake seem like a pie to the face. Would we all be better people if we didn’t delight in schadenfreude? Probably. But too bad. Now, if you don’t mind, I am going to watch Stevie Jacobs be attacked by a rooster three more times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/472cb5ed4bcbf54461188f9146c0f2b0f629f147/0_356_3300_1981/master/3300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d541184fd9040138f8286fc40358d38","title":"bayard rustin california pardon lgbtq","story":"Bayard Rustin, who worked alongside Martin Luther King Jr and died in 1987, was arrested in 1953 under a law used to prosecute LGBTQ+ peopleThe California governor has launched an initiative to grant clemency to people historically prosecuted for being gay, starting with a posthumous pardon for Bayard Rustin, a celebrated gay civil rights leader.Rustin, who worked alongside Martin Luther King Jr and helped organize the March on Washington, was arrested in 1953 for having consensual sex, convicted under a “vagrancy” law long used to prosecute LGBTQ+ people.Governor Gavin Newsom announced Wednesday that his office would pardon Rustin, who died in 1987, and also allow others subjected to this kind of discriminatory policing to apply for clemency. Rustin, who also helped organize the Montgomery bus boycott and who was given a posthumous presidential medal of freedom by Barack Obama, was sentenced to 60 days in jail and forced to register as a sex offender after his arrest.Black and LGBTQ+ lawmakers praised the pardon for Rustin, which some of them had formally requested. Some activists and civil rights attorneys, however, said they were eager to see the governor move beyond largely symbolic measures – and address the harms facing queer and transgender people incarcerated today.“The governor has so much power,” said Colby Lenz, a legal advocate for LGBTQ+ prisoners in California. “It’s great he’s doing this initiative, but it’s painful when I think about visiting so many queer and trans people who are incarcerated who continue to face so many barriers to release.”Newsom’s new clemency program relates to a law that previously criminalized consensual gay sex, which was repealed in 1975. In 1997, California allowed people convicted under that law to get off the sex offender registry, but that process did not remove their underlying conviction and did not constitute a pardon. The initiative unveiled this week seeks to identify eligible pardon candidates and allow people to apply.A spokesperson said the office didn’t have numbers on how many people might be eligible, and it’s unclear if anyone currently incarcerated would be affected.Newsom’s announcement said he was tackling “historic homophobia in the justice system”. But activists said they would like to see the effort extend to contemporary discrimination in the way LGBTQ+ people are arrested, prosecuted, sentenced and ultimately denied release.Lenz, who is part of a coalition that lobbies the governor’s office for the release of trans prisoners, says she would like to see the pardon effort extend to currently imprisoned trans people, who are disproportionately represented in the system, and can face high rates of violence and abuse inside.Survived and Punished is one of the partner groups, which advocates for survivors of abuse and domestic violence who were incarcerated after defending themselves, such as the famous case of Cyntoia Brown, sentenced to life at age 16 for murder, but recently released. There are numerous trans women incarcerated with similar cases in California, said Lenz, who estimated that Newsom has received at least 50 clemency requests on behalf of trans prisoners but has yet to grant any.Lenz has also advocated for queer cisgender women who have faced homophobic prosecution and abuse inside, and she noted that biases throughout the process can make it especially hard to get pardons and releases for LGBTQ+ people.Amber-Rose Howard, the executive director for Californians United for a Responsible Budget, a group that works to reduce the prison population, said she was pleased to see the news about Rustin and the clemency initiative, but that she hoped it would be a first step: “We will not address mass incarceration until we start to think about people convicted of more serious offenses.”While Rustin’s offense was a misdemeanor, Howard noted that many queer and trans people languishing in California prisons today were locked up for serious felonies, some sentenced to life without parole, meaning they will die inside if not granted a pardon: “I hope the conversation opens up … and I’m really hoping to see a lot of pardons answered.”Lynly Egyes, the Transgender Law Center legal director, noted that there were a range of laws that were still used in the US to criminalize trans people, such as loitering ordinances that have been described as “walking while trans” offenses. In addition to granting pardons to people criminalized in this way, a governor’s pardon power could also save immigrants from detention and deportation when they are facing removal due to a criminal conviction.“I would really hope the governor is using pardons to help all people who need to be released,” she said.Newsom has commuted the sentences of just over 20 people in his first year in office. His predecessor, Jerry Brown, issued commutation orders for 283 people.A Newsom spokesperson did not respond to questions about advocates’ calls for broader pardons for LGBTQ+ people.The announcement Wednesday echoes the recent apologies from police officials about the historic cases of law enforcement violence against LGBTQ+ people in the infamous Stonewall riot and similar attacks.Newsom similarly made made history when he formally apologized to Native Americans last year, acknowledging the brutal genocide and “war of extermination”. Indigenous leaders in the state praised the announcement but also called for specific reparations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bf1e5ba3746d4d4c2f7b2e2b9b2fef567a5db30/0_0_6016_3611/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46dba0e1e07faa1afde6547e2eb12464","title":"uber california self driving vehicles","story":"California has granted the company a permit to test its autonomous vehicles on public roads California issued a permit to Uber that allows it to test self-driving vehicles on public roads, the state’s department of motor vehicles announced on Wednesday.Uber joined 65 other companies including Apple, Tesla, Lyft and Waymo, that already had authorization to test autonomous vehicles in the state.The approval sets the stage for Uber to begin testing autonomous vehicles in California for the first time since it paused its self-driving car operations in March 2018. The company stopped testing the technology following an accident in which one of its autonomous vehicles killed a woman on an Arizona street.California has been issuing permits to test autonomous vehicles on public roads with a driver on board since 2014 and approved the testing of self driving cars on public roads without human drivers in 2018.An Uber spokeswoman said on Wednesday the company would start autonomous testing in San Francisco in the near future. It is not currently testing self-driving cars and will alert local and state authorities before doing so.“San Francisco is a great city to gather key learnings for self-driving technology given its complex and ever-changing environment,” the Uber spokeswoman said.Uber had been testing self driving cars in Phoenix, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and Toronto before halting the testing after the 2018 accident.Since then, the company said it had modified detection and tracking of pedestrians and cyclists and improved its emergency braking systems. It restarted testing in Pittsburgh in December 2018 and said it planned to launch self-driving vehicles in Washington DC by the end of 2020.Tesla, which also has a license from the California department of motor vehicles, disclosed a death involving a self-driving car in 2016 when the sensors of a Model S driving in autopilot mode failed to detect a white 18-wheel tractor-trailer crossing the highway.In addition to high-profile startups such as Uber, Lyft, and Waymo, legacy car companies including Ford, Honda and BMW have also been testing autonomous vehicles in the state."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07bd9cfed4c06316e79dfc27fd11b703cc6c634b/0_167_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=766a597ba78f1c20b7eac06ab8ee4c78","title":"grassroots activism tell us about a local campaign that worked","story":"Share your experience of being involved in a successful grassroots community movement Are you involved in a grassroots community project.

One main purpose is to keep alive the EU ambition for six western Balkan nations, with a combined population of 17.9 million people. No country has joined the EU since Croatia in 2013, but Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia hope to eventually.The paper is also intended to assuage doubts about further EU expansion among member states wearied by the eurozone crisis as well as backsliding on the rule of law and persistent corruption in some EU countries. It draws heavily on a plan put forward by Emmanuel Macron, who last year vetoed North Macedonia’s hopes of starting membership talks, causing despair among politicians in the region. The French president also joined Denmark and the Netherlands in blocking Albania.Potential EU member states have to complete 35 chapters to match EU standards in numerous areas, from a functioning public administration to fisheries to financial regulation. The new proposals mean that all countries will be required to complete fundamental reforms on democratic institutions and the rule of law before attempting more technical reforms.France complained that the EU enlargement process lacked credibility and said applicants should be required to repeat negotiating “chapters” if they later unpicked key reforms, an idea the commission has adopted.EU enlargement had to be “more credible” for EU member states and those seeking to join, the EU enlargement commissioner, Olivér Várhelyi, told journalists. “It has to be more predictable, more dynamic and more political,” he said, adding that “very many member states” had raised concerns in private, beyond countries that had voiced opposition in public.If countries seeking to join the EU could meet the criteria “then it can actually go quicker and in a much more meaningful way”.The new criteria will not apply to Serbia and Montenegro, which have embarked on EU accession under old rules. Várhelyi said it was “their choice” to opt into the new system, adding that he could see grounds to do so.The former Romanian prime minister Dacian Cioloș, who sits with Macron’s MEPs in the European parliament, described the plans as a good step forward, adding that his group “fully supports” new impetus to EU enlargement.“The next step, after agreeing on the new methodology, should be the opening of accession negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccfbd2bd834867adfecf96483f3e3aa5b0ae7ebe/0_80_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab3f2fab253bfaab9d6f7d46a7f5e671","title":"plane splits into three pieces after skidding off runway in istanbul","story":"Turkish officials say 179 were injured when the Pegasus Airlines aircraft crashed on landing in poor weatherThree people have died and 179 have been injured after a Pegasus Airlines plane flying into Istanbul’s Sabiha Gökçen airport skidded off the end of a wet runway and broke into three pieces.Fahrettin Koca, the health minister, told reporters that three people had died in hospital after the accident on Wednesday night but that none of the other wounded were in critical condition.Koca said there were 183 passengers and crew on board the plane which was arriving from the western Turkish province of İzmir.The governor of Istanbul, Ali Yerlikaya, said the wounded were being treated at 18 hospitals in the area.“The plane could not hold on the runway due to poor weather conditions and skidded for around 50-60 metres,” Yerlikaya told reporters at the airport.The plane, a Boeing 737-86J, split into three pieces after what Yerlikaya said was a drop of around 30 to 40 metres at the end of a runway made wet by heavy rain. Footage showed the plane landing and continuing at a high speed off the runway. Footage on Turkish media showed the plane’s fuselage, as well as a section of it near the tail, had broken off. Passengers were being led out as the plane lay on a patch of grass next to the runway. Dozens of emergency response personnel were taking passengers out of the plane and carrying them away on stretchers.Earlier footage showed part of the exterior of the plane had caught fire, which the Anadolu news agency said was put out by firefighters.Turkish Airlines said it cancelled all its flights in and out of Sabiha Gökçen on Wednesday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e01b05be4f8399953d96bd9149534a6919f3fdc/0_49_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5db5a03a2007db699b234818dd6816c6","title":"tokyo olympics chief says coronavirus could disrupt games","story":"Toshiro Muto ‘seriously worried’ about spread of virus with 170 days to goA senior Olympic official in Japan has warned that the coronavirus outbreak could “throw cold water” on preparations for Tokyo 2020, although organisers insist that there are no plans to cancel the Games.Toshiro Muto, the chief executive of the Tokyo Olympic organising committee, said he was concerned about the impact the spread of the virus was having in the run-up to the Olympics, which are due to open in 170 days.“I am seriously worried that the spread of the infectious disease could throw cold water on the momentum toward the Games,” Muto said during a meeting in Tokyo with officials from the International Paralympic Committee. “I hope that it will be stamped out as soon as possible.”Muto’s concerns were echoed by Saburo Kawabuchi, the mayor of the athletes’ village, where 11,000 competitors will stay during the Games.“I truly hope that the infectious disease will die down somehow so that we will be able to operate the Paralympics and Olympics smoothly,” he said. “In the worst case we will do our utmost for the athletes so that they will be able to concentrate on performing their best.”The coronavirus outbreak, which has killed 490 people in mainland China and infected more than 23,000, has disrupted several qualifying events that were due to be held in the country, including those for women’s football and basketball, boxing and badminton.It is a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city.New and troubling viruses usually originate in animal hosts. Ebola and flu are other examples – severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (Mers) are both caused by coronaviruses that came from animals.\u0026nbspThe virus causes\u0026nbsppneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. If people are admitted to hospital, they may get support for their lungs and other organs as well as fluids. Recovery will depend on the strength of their immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.Two members of one family have been confirmed to have the virus in the UK, after more than 400 were tested and found negative. The Foreign Office has urged UK citizens to leave\u0026nbspChina\u0026nbspif they can.The number of people to have contracted the virus could be far higher, as people with mild symptoms may not have been detected. Modelling by\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbsp(WHO) experts at Imperial College London suggests there could be as many as 100,000 cases, with uncertainty putting the margins between 30,000 and 200,000.Unless you have recently travelled to China or been in contact with someone infected with the virus, then you should treat any cough or cold symptoms as normal. The\u0026nbspNHS advises\u0026nbspthat people should call 111 instead of visiting the GP’s surgery as there is a risk they may infect others.Health experts are starting to say it could become a pandemic, but right now it falls short of what the WHO would consider to be one. A pandemic, in WHO terms, is “the worldwide spread of a disease”. Coronavirus cases have been confirmed in about 25 countries outside China, but by no means in all 195 on the WHO’s list.There is no need to panic. The spread of the virus outside China is worrying but not an unexpected development. The WHO has declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency of international concern, and says there is a “window of opportunity” to halt the spread of the disease. The key issues are how transmissible this new coronavirus is between people and what proportion become severely ill and end up in hospital. Often viruses that spread easily tend to have a milder impact.There have been no deaths from the virus in Japan, but it has the largest number of infections – 33 – outside China. On Wednesday, 10 passengers onboard a luxury cruise liner off the Japanese port of Yokohama tested positive for the illness, forcing health authorities to place all 3,700 passengers and crew in quarantine for 14 days.Craig Spence, a spokesman for the Paralympic committee, said: “We have full confidence that the relevant authorities, in particular here in Japan and the World Health Organization, will take all the necessary measures to address the situation.”But Tokyo’s governor, Yuriko Koike, has suggested that failure to contain the outbreak could affect the Games. “We must firmly tackle the new coronavirus to contain it, or we are going to regret it,” she said last week.Demand for the 7.8m Olympics tickets is high, with applications exceeding supply by at least 10 times. About 4.5m tickets have been distributed domestically via a lottery."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b27fb7384bc85c2d9b99318cdbeb3c7ef618c80/146_0_1182_709/master/1182.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=776c5439715460ad24d413b4f27a05be","title":"diary of a coronavirus evacuee everyones trying to avoid contact with each other","story":"Australian Daniel Ou Yang, 21, was on the Air New Zealand flight out of virus-struck Wuhan to Auckland. Here he writes about the stress of his evacuationAt 2.52pm, we arrived at Wuhan Tianjin airport.The drive here was smooth, all the big wide roads with no cars on them. We made it through the checkpoints and arrived within an hour.I said my goodbyes to my grandparents at the house, they were holding back tears. My dad sent me into the airport. After he sat around for a few minutes I told him to go home, and I’ll look after myself from there on.There were a lot of us evacuating, with two or three other countries including us. Everyone’s wearing masks, and it was nerve-racking being around so many people in such close proximity. Hearing about a lot of evacuations with confirmed cases of the coronavirus on the flight, it was definitely not ideal to be around so many people at the airport.I found myself a quiet spot, and talked to my family and friends on my phone until we started lining up to get our boarding pass.At 4.30pm they told us after getting our boarding pass to wait for the security clearance to be opened, but to line up first because they’ll be a lot of different countries evacuating at once all through one entrance.It wasn’t until around 9.30pm that they started processing everyone. Our flight was due to leave at 11pm.I originally lined up behind everyone, again nervous of the close proximity. As it reached 10pm, I saw a lot of Chinese rushing to the front, and I was encouraged to join them, so I did. They were all going on the same Auckland flight as me, so we were allowed to cut the queue to be processed first.I felt a bit guilty, all these foreigners looking at us cutting the line, maybe they will think that we are getting special treatment because we are Chinese.There was this lady with her two young kids also evacuating and they were running late. I waited for them to bring them with me through the security. From there everyone was wearing full hazmat suits.It took us an hour to finally get through to immigration and the last security check point before our flight gate 334. It was already 11.10pm.I got through but the lady was stopped because she had ice skating shoes in the carry on which weren’t allowed. I told her to just leave them, but she was unwilling to. In the end, it was 11.20pm and I said I needed to go make the flight and I’ll tell them to wait for her and her kids.It was a huge rush and I thought I missed it because there was no one at the gate. But I made it just in time. I was on the phone to the embassy letting them know about the lady and kids. I hope they made it on.The flight itself wasn’t too bad, but we were delayed so didn’t leave until 1am.After having a really late dinner (or early breakfast) I fell asleep very quickly. Luckily there was a spare seat next to me so I sat next to the window and a girl sat on the other end, leaving plenty of space for each other.We were supplied with masks and hand sanitisers along with the normal flight care package. I woke up at 10 and went to the bathroom. We were encouraged to leave our seat as little as possible so I was hesitant.Used a lot of hand sanitisers throughout the flight along with everyone else. Everyone is just trying to avoid contact with each other as much as possible and constantly using hand sanitisers.We’ve arrived at New Zealand now. I have to prepare myself for another long flight back to Christmas Island, a huge detour. I’m nervous about being there.I heard from others there’s barely any wifi and no reception. There is nothing to do. Hopefully the facility is clean, and I can be out of there smoothly. I will want to try and keep everyone updated, but with the lack of reception and wifi, I think it’ll be very limited.I just want to get back home."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4162752.1580919245!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"health what the different party manifestos say","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAll the parties want to spend more on hospitals, but also more on primary care and GPs. And they want to cut a variety of patient charges. Photograph: PAHealth is supposed to be one of the key battlegrounds in the election campaign, but there is a large degree of unanimity in the different party manifestos on the issue. All parties, for example, support Sláintecare as the way forward some more explicitly than others. All parties also agree a massive expansion in funding and staffing is needed over the coming five years, notwithstanding that our health spending is already relatively high by international standards. They want to spend more on hospitals, but also more on primary care and GPs. And they want to cut a variety of patient charges.A number of the manifestos say they are costed, but there’s nothing that wouldn’t fit on the back of an envelope.Here’s how the manifestos measure up on the main issues in health:The big plan for the futureEveryone agrees the health service needs to be got back on course, and Sláintecare is seen as the road-map for this. Fine Gael is fully backing the plan, with a proposal to spend €5 billion a year extra on health by 2025. Sinn Féin is fully onboard for Sláintecare as part of its plan to create “an Irish national health service”. It pledges to spend an additional €4.5 billion, and €1.58 billion for capital spending, “over and above what has already been committed for the period including for demographics”.The Social Democrats, the spiritual parents of Sláintecare, promise it will “turn our healthcare system around” but they do not say how much they plan to spend on it while the Greens say they will “adequately” fund it.Waiting listsGenerally speaking, the parties believe extra staffing will alleviate the waiting list problem. Fianna Fáil says it will apply a four-hour target for emergency department waits, and will ensure consultants are present in emergency departments on a 24-hour basis. Anyone waiting over six months for a procedure will be able to apply for funding, it says.The Social Democrats are promising to abolish home care waiting lists through increased investment in home care packages and step-down facilities.People Before Profit is promising to guarantee access to healthcare within 18 weeks and to emergency department treatment within four hours.StaffingFine Gael says it will recruit thousands of extra staff – 1,000 consultants over 10 years, 5,000 nurses and 3,840 primary care workers.Fianna Fáil wants to take on 1,000 consultants, 4,000 nurses, 200 ambulance staff, 300 practice nurses and 350 public health nurses.Sinn Féin says it will recruit another 2,500 nurses, 1,000 consultants, 1,500 staff for primary care centres and 1,000 practice, community and public health nurses.Nobody is too clear on where these staff are going to come from. General PracticeAn increase in GP training places is being promised by both Fine Gael (to 300 a year, from 217 this autumn) and Fianna Fáil (to 274).With Sláintecare stressing the need for more services to be delivered in the community, Fianna Fáil and Aontú both say they will devote 10 per cent of health spending to primary care - about three times the current level. The Social Democrats promise a “massive investment” in new primary care staff, and an expansion of diagnostic servicesExpansion plansWith the population rising and ageing, all parties support an expansion in services. Fianna Fáil is planning four new elective hospitals (Fine Gael will manage with three) and will spend an extra €200 million on Fair Deal.Fine Gael says it will fund an additional one million home care hours for every year it is in office.Sinn Féin plans to deliver an additional 12 million home help hours over the five years, and to increase the number of nursing beds by 1,250. The Social Democrats say they will increase investment in mental health.Patient charges Nobody likes having to pay when someone is sick, and the parties know it.Fianna Fáil (and PBP) will abolish hospital car parking charges, while Fine Gael is proposing to limit them to €10 a day.Fianna Fáil also wants to abolish prescription charges and reduce the drug payment scheme threshold to €100, while Fine Gael says it will “further reduce” prescription charges.Fine Gael wants to abolish inpatient charges for children and give medical cards to people with terminal illnesses. Labour says it will halve hospital in- and outpatient charges and will give patients on “continuous” treatment a “waiver” for parking.Sinn Féin triumphs in the giveaway stakes with a promise to abolish prescription charges and to roll out “free prescription medicines for all”. ED and inpatients charges will also go, as will hospital car parking charges, the party says. It will also give medical cards to all cancer patients.Universal accessFree GP care - currently provided to under-6s and over 70s – has been a cornerstone of Fine Gael’s health policy in recent years. Now it says it wants to extend it to under-18s (as does Labour), and those on a carer’s grant. It also wants to introduce free dental care for under-16s, a measure that is being as vociferously opposed by dentists as free GP care has been criticised by family doctors.Fianna Fáil says it will expand free GP care “on the basis of means” while Sinn Féin is promising “free GP care for all” over a term of government, starting with two free visits for everybody not covered by a medical or GP visit card in year one.OtherFine Gael says it will introduce a no-fault vaccination compensation scheme, set up a national medicines agency and offer free contraception for women, starting with 17-25 year-olds.Labour and Sinn Féin want exclusion zones introduced near maternity hospitals to ensure “safe access” to abortion service.Sinn Féin is promising free contraception, free sanitary products for some groups of women, free universal counselling services and three cycle of IVF for couples trying to start a family.Labour will ensure forthcoming legislation will deal with the issue of international surrogacy it is also promising improved access to health services for people who are transgender.Aontú wants legislation requiring the administration of pain relief to “preborn babies” undergoing a termination, as well as a legal ban on abortion on the grounds of disability or gender.The Greens, in their single-page health document (mental health gets another page), says children should be required to do half an hour of exercise every day, there should be more showers in workplaces and Vat should be removed from sunscreen and reproductive goods.PBP is proposing to abolish the HSE and replace it with “democratically elected community health councils”.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoI have never voted for Sinn F\u0026eacutein in my life and this time I\u0026rsquom thinking of voting for them\u0026rsquoDUP MP says it \u0026lsquogrates\u0026rsquo that Irish parties \u0026lsquorecoil\u0026rsquo at power sharing with Sinn F\u0026eacuteinSF president had denied Conor Murphy linked Paul Quinn murder with criminalityIt is expected two solar probes observing the sun will revolutionise solar scienceTipperary man was shot dead during police raid on hotel in Santa Cruz 11 years agoVarious plans to get health service back on track in key election battlegroundAttackers use sledgehammers and paint to deface monumentFailure to transfer tasks to junior staff, bullying and burnout among issues highlightedChurch in Finglas to be replaced by one 10 times smaller and land sold to city councilOrganised crime and terrorism continue to pose challenges, says secretary generalPolling was postponed after sudden death of Independent candidate Marese SkehanThese are the people ignored by the parties whose leaders look down on them from lamppostsPSNI make safe device planted by suspected dissident republicansJohn Paul Carey (32) stole \u0026euro300 from Little Island post office after receiving bomb threatsConduct of party leaders surprises UK observers while Donohoe answers the big questionsAction taken against Dublin building site firm over oil spill after campaign surveyGarda\u0026iacute appeal for information after targeted attack in prison grounds leaves two in hospital"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4162942.1580925449!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 politics on the menu in donegal coffee shop","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMike Murphy and his colleagues have laptops, calculators and invoices strewn on the table in front of them.

Photograph:  Freya McClements Even on a weekday morning, Tank and Skinny’s coffee shop and home bakery in Muff, Co Donegal, is busy.It opened in 2016, a few months after the last election a popular meeting spot for a catch up with friends, a family treat or a business meeting, it has changed the landscape of the village.“Whoever would have thought of a coffee shop in Muff? It’s a goldmine, so it is,” one punter remarks.Yet among the breakfasts and pastries being served up when The  visits, there is also plenty of politics on the menu.Mike Murphy and his colleagues have laptops, calculators and invoices strewn on the table in front of them. They run Moolicious Foods in Moville, just up the coast Murphy would like to see better government support for rural businesses and for the fishing industry.He namechecks two of the candidates, outgoing TDs Joe McHugh (Fine Gael) and Fianna Fáil’s Charlie McConalogue – “they’ve both been really supportive of us” – and explains his preference would be for a combination of their two parties.“That would bring a level of stability to the country. If Sinn Féin get in, I think it will be all over the place. I’ve a feeling they’re more mavericks.”Under Leo Varadkar, he says, “everyone felt the country was in a safe pair of hands.” So what happened? “Hospitals and housing brought Leo down,” his colleague chips in.“I’m Fianna Fáil, always,” adds his wife Alison. “It’s a Fianna Fáil house. My family was part of it, when they were founded. Do you know the original Neil Blaney? she asks. “His meetings were held in my granny’s house in Buncrana way back.”The public sectorGregory works in the public sector. “We’re always the hardest hit, with levies over the years, and nothing ever comes back to us. Fine Gael haven’t done enough to address it.”He dismisses mention of the financial bailout. “We should be past that. Fine Gael have had their opportunity. They were given a chance.”Sinn Féin, he thinks, will do well, and may end up in a coalition government. “People are looking for change but they don’t know what the change is that they’re looking for.”“Ah I was fond of Leo, though I don’t think he did a great job,” chips in her friend Mary McGinnity.“What we need are jobs, this is a fabulous place to bring up a family but you need to be able to live,” she says.‘Who’s Peter Casey?’McGuinness is from Greencastle among her neighbours is the Independent candidate Peter Casey. “He’s not a good talker in debates but he’s very pleasant if you meet him out,” says McGuinness. “In the presidential election he got all the local votes, but that won’t happen this time.”Her fellow diners would seem to bear that out. “Who’s Peter Casey?” Joan Donnell asks.She and her sister-in-law, Heather McLucas, are having a vegetarian breakfast in their “usual Tuesday haunt”. A Donegal woman who now lives over the Border in Derry, Donnell is not eligible to vote, but she explains that if she could she would vote for the Green Party candidate. “I’ve just become so much more aware of everything that’s happening with the environment and how we’re destroying it.”Rory McLaughlin has moved the other way he is a Derry man “exiled” to Donegal. “I haven’t decided yet,” he says. “I know they say all politics is local, but many of the issues highlighted are Dublin, Cork, Limerick centred – things like homelessness and rent prices.”“Instead he cites broadband, roads and jobs. “There are loads of vacancies in Dublin or Cork, but here young people have to move away to get employment, and there’s the impact of that on communities.He acknowledges Sinn Féin have made a “massive turnaround” since the European and local elections last year, but admits “I don’t know what that represents. The big thing that’s stood out in Sinn Féin’s favour has been the pensions.“I think it’s a reflection that people want change, and they associate Sinn Féin with change, because they haven’t been in power.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"harry mcgee s final seat prediction for election 2020","story":"There is an apocryphal quote that is often attributed to the late US president Lyndon Johnson about the vagaries of elections. After losing a particularly bitterly-fought election, he is reputed to have said: “The people have spoken, the bastards.” Predicting election campaigns in Ireland is a guessing game that sometimes presents itself as an inexact science. Opinion polls and the results of secondary elections such as council elections, byelections and European elections give you the direction of the wind. But the system we have in Ireland of multi-seat constituencies allied with transferable votes makes it a very difficult exercise to carry out with any degree of accuracy.No tally taken prior to voting could have told you that Bríd Smith of People Before Profit would win the last seat in Dublin South-Central in 2016, by less than 40 votes, from Fianna Fáil’s Catherine Ardagh, relying wholly on the distribution of a tiny surplus that had got Joan Collins over the line in a previous count.Usually, there are predictors. For this general election it was last year’s round of local and European elections, as well as the autumn opinion polls, plus the November byelections. But they have all been thrown out the window since the start of the campaign. In Lazarus fashion, Sinn Féin has confounded expectations and become the party for the strong prevailing mood of the electorate: and that is change. Nobody foresaw it, not even Sinn Féin. The party now lacks candidates in constituencies where it might have won a second seat. Fine Gael has tumbled down. Fianna Fáil looks like it’s treading water a bit but there might be a latent support there. Of the rest, only the Greens look stronger, but outside Dublin, they remain niche.The 33rd Dáil will have an extra two seats compared with the outgoing Dáil, bringing the total up to 160. That means extra seats in Cavan-Monaghan, Kildare South and Dublin Central. In addition, Laois and Offaly combine into one constituency, with five seats overall rather than six.Here is my tally, broken down by party and where I see they may gain some seats and lose others.1. Dublin Mid-West: This would be a technical gain as the party has no seat here after losing the byelection for Frances Fitzgerald’s former seat. Emer Higgins should safely take one seat out of four and the party might even consider itself in with a shout for a second seat, although that is a long shot.2. Cork North-Central: This is another technical gain as there is a vacant seat. Fine Gael has no seat there since Dara Murphy’s resignation in December. Colm Burke should easily win one seat for the party in the four-seat constituency.3. Tipperary:  The target is seat held by Independent Séamus Healy. Fine Gael has gone out on a limb by picking two new and relatively unknown candidates. It had a full quota in 2016 but terrible vote management and candidate selection lost it its seat. The party’s strong local election performance should provide it with the basis for a seat here at the expense of an Independent. Was it a mistake by Mary Newman Julian not to contest the local elections, unlike her running mate Garret Ahearn? Could they repeat the mistakes of 2016? The mood has darkened considerably here.4. Cavan-Monaghan: There is an extra seat in this constituency. Fianna Fáíl already has two and is unlikely to win three. Sinn Féin has traditionally been not as strong in Cavan as in Monaghan. But the surge in the poll now means that Pauline Tully could edge out Fine Gael’s TP O’Reilly for the last seat. This would be a big body blow.5. Cork North-West: The target is a Fianna Fáil seat. A one-point increase needed in vote share compared with 2016. John Paul O’Shea ran as an Independent in 2016 and did well. Now under the Fine Gael banner will run Fianna Fáíl close.6. Cork East: Target is a Sinn Féin seat. A two percentage-point increase in vote share is required compared with 2016. Again a close battle with Fianna Fáil looked in prospect to topple a precarious Sinn Féin seat. Pa O’Driscoll is based in the northern end of the constituency and while the teacher has a high profile and is a strong campaigner, he might struggle for transfers in the latter counts. On balance, it’s hard to see Sinn Féin not holding the seat, even though the party is not showing as strongly in Munster.7. Dublin-Rathdown: Shane Ross is the target. A five percentage-point increase in vote share required compared with 2016. Neale Richmond will need to put in a huge performance to create one of the shocks of the day by taking out Ross. And now, it is not only Ross but also Fianna Fáil’s Shay Brennan he has to worry about.8. Kerry: The target is a Sinn Féin seat. A five-point increase is required. The Sinn Féin seat is no longer in such danger. Fine Gael’s candidate Michael Kennelly comes from a well-known Listowel GAA family. Fianna Fáil looks marginally stronger though after the local elections but there is a neater geographical ide between Kennelly and sitting TD Brendan Griffin. May be moot now if Pa Daly can harness all of the Martin Ferris vote.9. Longford-Westmeath: The target is a Labour Party seat. Another ding-dong battle between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael for a vulnerable seat, this time the one vacated by Labour’s Willie Penrose. It will boil down to be a bout between two Longford candidates. Fianna Fáíl is stronger in the constituency overall but Fine Gael is stronger in Longford (it won 39 per cent of the vote in last year’s local elections. Its candidate Micheál Carrigy has a high profile. A bellwether constituency. Don’t rule out Sinn Féin.10. Galway East: A five-point gain is required to take a seat off Seán Canney. This will be a local battle, between the outgoing Tuam Independent and Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil rivals from the same area. Fine Gael’s Peter Roche performed strongly in the local elections but Fianna Fáil had a big day in Tuam, taking four out of seven. Again very, very tight. But on opinion poll evidence you would have to favour Fianna Fáil, or even Canney holding.11. Louth: A two-point increase is required. The target is Independent Peter Fitzpatrick. Fine Gael has only one seat here after Fitzpatrick’s resignation from the party in 2018. Dundalk-based councillor John McGahon will be one of five jousting for the last seat and might just come up short.12. Limerick City: The target is a Labour seat. A five-point rise on 2016 is required. Others, Fianna Fáil and the Greens, look stronger in the battle for the final seat with Jan O’Sullivan.1. Dún Laoghaire: to Fianna FáilGreens. A certainty. Fine Gael holds three seats out of four because outgoing ceann comhairle Seán Barrett was automatically returned in 2016. He is not standing this time. The party won 25 per cent of the vote in 2016. Now it’s looking at the dismal scenario of returning only one seat here.2. Dublin North-West: to Fianna Fáíl. Probability is high. Noel Rock is a very doughty campaigner but he is up against it this time. He narrowly saw off Fianna Fáil’s Paul McAuliffe in 2016 but his rival is in a much stronger position now, and Fianna Fáil had a very strong local election here. Sinn Féin has been on the slide here but it would be hard to see Dessie Ellis’s fall being so dramatic as to lose.3. Galway West: to Greens or Fianna Fáil. Probability is medium to high. Like Clare the party managed to retain two seats with only 24 per cent of the vote, and relied heavily on Labour transfers. Its two TDs, Seán Kyne and Hildegarde Naughton, are high profile but would need to increase the party’s share of the vote against parties whose support levels are rising.4. Dublin Bay South: to the Labour Party. Probability low to medium. The second Fine Gael seat could be in play here if Labour’s Kevin Humphreys gains traction. A strong Green performance could also impact. If the  opinion poll for Fine Gael is correct, this might make one of its seats in this “true blue” constituency vulnerable.5. Wexford:  to Independent or Sinn Féin. Paul Kehoe clung on in 2016 will face a challenge again. Sinn Féin’s Johnny Mythen performed well in the recent byelection and the party is flying in the polls. Verona Murphy’s candidacy could also have an impact on Kehoe.6. Clare: to IndependentFianna Fáíl. The party won less votes than Fianna Fáíl in 2016 but still managed to retain both seats thanks to Labour transfers. Fianna Fáil seems to have a very strong ticket and should win a second seat. The decision by Michael Harty not to run will be a boon to it. Fine Gael’s only vulnerability is losing to another Independent candidate in the shape of Michael McNamara.7. Dublin South-Central: to GreensFianna Fáil. Catherine Byrne has survived here against all the odds but this might be one election too many. Fianna Fáíl looks strong for a seat as do the Greens. Something will have to give and it could be Fine Gael.8. Meath East: to Sinn Féin. Darren O’Rourke was not all that far away in 2016 and will not be all that far away this time either. Many of those who live on the Dublin side of the constituency are commuters who are one of the big groups clamouring for change. Regina Doherty’s seat, in particular, is vulnerable.1. Dún Laoghaire: There is an extra seat. Needs a one per cent increase in vote share compared with the 2016 general election. Last time out this was a three-seater because outgoing Ceann Comhairle Seán Barrett was a TD. Fianna Fáil do have a quota so should pick up a seat. It is running two candidates, Mary Hanafin and Cormac Devlin\u0026nbspand there is a danger they could cancel each other out. The Greens look strong for a seat here.2. Dublin North-West: Target is a Fine Gael seat. Needs a one per cent rise in support from the 2016 general election. Finglas-based Paul McAuliffe topped the poll amid a strong Fianna Fáil performance in the local elections and is current Lord Mayor. Fine Gael’s Noel Rock relied hugely on Labour transfers to pip him last time out and he looks very vulnerable.3. Dublin Central: There is an extra seat in this constituency. Needs a five percentage-point increase since 2016: This moves from a three- to four-seat constituency. Mary Fitzpatrick would need to add five points to her 11 per cent showing in 2016 though she performed very strongly in her own electoral area in the local elections. Mary Lou McDonald will top the poll and the Greens also look as if they they may pip Garry Gannon of the Social Democrats.4. Dublin South-Central: One per cent increase required compared with 2016. Target is Independent or People Before Profit seats, or perhaps Fine Gael. Catherine Ardagh lost out by less than 40 votes in 2016. She has had a high profile since as her party’s leader in the Seanad and Fianna Fáil did well in the local elections. Only seat safe here is Sinn Féin and she is an odds-on favourite to regain the seat once held by her late father, Seán Ardagh. Sinn Féin would have won two seats here if it ran two candidates.5. Clare: Target is an Independent or Fine Gael seat. Two percentage-point rise required since 2016: Fine Gael’s second seat here was very vulnerable until Independent Michael Harty announced he would not contest the election. Fianna Fáil seems to have got its formula right. Cathal Crowe is a strong candidate who did himself no harm with his boycott of the proposed Royal Irish Constabulary event. It had five per cent more votes at 30 per cent than Fine Gael in 2016 but won only seat, while its rival won two. It looks as if Fine Gael will be the loser here, with Independent and former Labour TD Michael McNamara and Green Róisín Garvey in the hunt for the fourth seat.6. Galway East: Target is an Independent seat held by Seán Canney: Six percentage-point increase needed compared with 2016: Tuam is going to be the battleground here. Canney is defending a seat he won handily. The other two seats are in the southeastern Loughrea-Portumna axis held by Anne Rabbitte of Fianna Fáil and in the Athenry-GortKinvara southern axis held by Fine Gael’s Ciarán Cannon. The Independent brand around Tuam, so strong from 2014-2016, receded in last year’s local elections. Fine Gael has chosen a strong councillor, Peter Roche who topped the poll in Tuam. But Fianna Fáil won four out of seven council seats in Tuam, and that might give it an edge. It has chosen Cllr Donagh Killilea, a son of the late TD and MEP Mark Killilea. He’s come late into the race though but at this stage he might be ahead of Roche. Don’t underestimate Canney.7. Kerry: Target is a Sinn Féin seat. An eight percentage-point increase needed here from 2016. Sinn Féin was vulnerable but not any more. Fianna Fáil had very good local elections and the addition of Tralee councillor Norma Foley gives it a very strong ticket and may dent the impact Michael Healy-Rae had in the northern part of the constituency in 2016. Norma Moriarty is comfortably placed in the Iveragh Peninsula in the south while sitting TD John Brassil is from Ballyheigue, geographically close to Foley. Fine Gael has a strong Listowel-based councillor Mike Kennelly as its second candidate. But Pa Daly, seen as a beaten docket a month ago, is now back in the frame for Sinn Féin.8. Longford-Westmeath: Target is a Labour seat. Seven percentage-point increase needed from 2016: Fianna Fáil is the largest party in the entire constituency but the last seat may turn out to be a battle between Fianna Fáíl’s Joe Flaherty and Micheál Carrigy for the “Longford” seat, a county in which Fine Gael is stronger. And now Sorca Clarke of Sinn Féin has moved into view.9. Carlow-Kilkenny: The target is a Sinn Féin or Fine Gael seat and a two percentage-point increase is required. Winning three out of five seats is always a massive task and if Fianna Fáíl pulls it off here, it will be well on its way to government. John McGuinness and Bobby Aylward ided the Kilkenny vote very well last time. Sinn Féin’s Kathleen Funchion is no longer vulnerable. Fianna Fáil’s Carlow candidate Jennifer Murnane O’Connor came very close in 2016 and could get over the line this time. But will it be at the expense of Pat Deering of Fine Gael, or of her running mate, Aylward?10. Cork East: Target is a Sinn Féin seat. Four percentage-point increase required since 2016. Another Sinn Féin TD, Pat Buckley, looked like facing a challenge following a poor local election for the party in Co Cork but now is seen as safe, even though the Sinn Féin vote is not as strong in Munster. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s second candidates had only a handful of votes separating them the last time around. The party’s second candidates are at opposite ends of the constituency. It’s now marginal.11. Laois-Offaly: A Fine Gael seat is the target. A four percentage-point increase in required. It is a Fianna Fáil heartland and Fine Gael’s Marcella Corcoran Kennedy had a middling vote in 2016. However, Fine Gael did well in locals and it would be a tall order for Fianna Fáil to win three out of five here. Brian Stanley of Sinn Féin remains strong in Portlaoise.12. Louth: A Sinn Féin or Independent seat is the target. A nine point increase is needed. Fianna Fáil could have a higher percentage of votes than Fine Gael but might struggle with getting enough transfers to bring the party over the line. Its second candidate, James Byrne, is based in Drogheda where there is already a number of strong candidates. Sinn Féin now looks as if it will hold on to two which would make it a tricky proposition for Byrne to join Declan Breathnach in the Dáíl.13. Kildare South: An extra seat. A four percentage-point increase is required. An effective three-seater because Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl was elected here. Fianna Fáil won two out of three in 2016 when it was actually a three-seater but a taller order this time as Mark Wall of Labour could sneak in. Suzanne Doyle is a high-profile running mate for sitting TD Fiona O’Loughlin and there is potential there. But it’s less straightforward than 2016. Fiona McLoughlin Healy and Cathal Berry are two Independents, one of whom might spring a surprise.14. Dublin South-West: The target is an Independent seat. Fianna Fáil got a quota here in 2016 and would need an eight-point increase in first-preference votes plus good vote management to win a second seat. However, candidate Charlie O’Connor had a mammoth local election in Tallaght and could squeeze through in a big field at the expense of Katherine Zappone or Paul Murphy.15. Dublin Fingal: The target is a Fine Gael seat. A five percentage-point boost is needed. On paper the party has a chance here of taking a second seat after getting 1.4 quotas in 2016. However, the Greens will now need to take it in a scenario where Fine Gael is winning no seats. A very tall order.16. Galway West: A five percentage-point increase is required. Fianna Fáil won more votes here than Fine Gael in 2016 but still returned only one TD. One of the Fine Gael TDs could be vulnerable but the disparity between Eamon Ó Cuív’s votes, and his running mates’ have always been too high. Against that, the party had a good local election in the city, and Ollie Crowe is an experienced candidate. His chances are remote though given the crowded field, and the strengths of other newish candidates such as Niall Ó Tuathail of the Social Democrats, Pauline O’Reilly of the Green Party, and (perhaps) Mairéad Farrell of Sinn Féin.17. Limerick City: A Labour Party seat is the target. Fianna Fáil has a strong ticket in Willie O’Dea and James Collins, a cousin of Niall’s. Sinn Féin’s Maurice Quinlivan looked on shaky ground a month ago but no more. Jan O’Sullivan might be more precarious.18. Dublin Rathdown: The target is the Independent Seat. An eight-point increase over 2016 is required. This was going to be the only constituency in the country where Fianna Fáíl had no seat. But in the last week, Shay Brennan has been talked up as a possible challenger for Shane Ross’s seat, which has come as a huge surprise.1. Wicklow: Could miss out to Greens, Social Democrats or Independents. Stephen Donnelly won almost 21 per cent of the vote here in 2016 but as a Social Democrat. With 13 per cent of the vote in 2016, Fianna Fáil would need to add at least 9 per cent to have any chance of taking a second seat. The big unknown is how Donnelly’s vote will be impacted by him being a Fianna Fáil candidate. It will certainly be a negative drag despite his profile as his party’s health spokesman. Valerie Cox’s candidacy will not be a help.3. Sligo-Leitrim: Again Fianna Fáil won two out of four here on 32 per cent of the vote. Fine Gael had a good local election in Sligo but Fianna Fáil is still a little stronger. Marian Harkin’s entry into the race has upset all that planning. If she knocks out a sitting TD, the most likely is one of the two Fianna Fáil deputies. But there is a scenario where Fine Gael – which again messed up its candidate strategy here – could end up with zero seats.4. Kildare North: Could lose to Greens or Labour Party. Fianna Fáil won the second seat here on the back of a lowish first preference. The Green Party candidate, Vincent P Martin, might pose a threat, as might Labourveteran Emmet Stagg. Now Sinn Féin could also be a player here. On balance, it could be a hold, especially if vote management remains as disciplined as it was in 2016.5. Roscommon-Galway: Fianna Fáil is potentially vulnerable to Fine Gael in the only constituency where it has no representation. Fine Gael’s Aisling Dolan is based in Ballinasloe and not widely known in Roscommon. Fine Gael had a poor local election in Roscommon. Besides Denis Naughten is still regarded as proxy Fine Gael. It will be interesting to see if the addition of the high-profile Órla Leyden will affect the dynamic between herself and sitting TD, Eugene Murphy. On balance, a hold.6. Dublin Bay South: Labour poses a threat. Jim O’Callaghan got elected with just over half a quota in 2016. He has been helped by having a high profile but if he fails to add to his first preferences, he might find Labour’s Kevin Humphreys breathing down his neck. He relied a lot on transfers from Chris Andrews of Sinn Féin in 2016 and may not get as many. The absence of Michael McDowell from the slate will help his cause. Very unlikely to lose.1. Donegal: Target is an Independent seat. It needs a one-point increase in vote share over 2016. Pádraig Mac Lochlainn narrowly lost out to Thomas Pringle in 2016 using an ill-advised three-candidate strategy. This time there is just two candidates and the party has high hopes it can win back its second seat. Will be tight though.2. Dublin West: Target is Labour PartyS-PBP. A two percentage point increase needed over 2016. Paul Donnelly has been knocking on the door in Dublin West and was the last remaining unsuccessful candidate in 2016. However, Sinn Féin did not have a great local election but it is in constituencies like this that it has a gale wind behind it. Ruth Coppinger looks in real trouble, as does Labour. A certain win.3. Wexford: Target is Fine Gael. A two-point increase is needed. Another constituency where Sinn Féin came close to winning a seat in 2016. There have been mixed messages this year, a poor local election and a slightly better byelection performance. However, the momentum has returned and Johnny Mythen might be the fit. He is located to the north of the constituency which might be a handicap.4. Cavan-Monaghan: There is an extra seat in this constituency. A six-point increase is needed. This is one of the few constituencies where Sinn Féin has the potential to win a second seat. Cavan has always been a bit of a challenge for it but this time Pauline Tully is highly experienced and has a chance alongside Matt Carthy.5. Mayo: Target is a Fine Gael seat. Rose Conway-Walsh is an excellent Senator but always seemed to be coming up a little short in Mayo. But the surge in party support will certainly make her a contender here, and if she is ahead of the Greens’ Saoirse McHugh, which is likely, her transfers might push the Sinn Féin candidate over the line.6. Longford-Westmeath: A new planet is discovered in the galaxy. Sorca Clarke was seen as a mid-table finisher until a fortnight ago but now Sinn Féin can challenge in this constituency. I still see the final seat going to either Fianna Fáíl or Fine Gael.1. Dublin Mid-West: to Fine Gael. This was almost certain before the campaign started but the party will now be in the mix to retain its two TDs in this four-seat constituency. Its challenge will be to stay ahead of Gino Kenny, the Greens and Paul Gogarty.2. Louth: to the Labour Party. Possibility is medium to low. The party always had a tall order on its hands retaining two seats in Louth following Gerry Adams’s retirement. And while it won more than 24 per cent of the vote in the local elections, it needs a higher volume of number ones to compensate for lack of transfers. A fortnight ago, I would have said No. Now, I would say it has a good chance of holding.3. Cork East: to Fianna FáilFine Gael. This a bit of long shot. Pat Buckley looked a goner last May after the party bombed in the locals. But it’s bounced back and so has he. While Sinn Féin not showing up as highly in Munster, he can ward off the challenge from Fianna Fáíl and Fine Gael.Other constituencies: I had another eight constituencies marked as potential losses for Sinn Féin. But that was a fortnight ago. And the world has changed since then.1. Louth: Target is Sinn FéinIndependent. A two percentage-point increase is needed compared with 2016. Despite coming out of government, Labour very narrowly lost a number of seats and this was one of them. Ged Nash will be buoyed by the party’s strong showing in its stronghold of Drogheda and is in contention to take a seat, although it will be a scrap.2. Dublin Bay North: The party is targeting seats vacated by Independents. A two-point increase in vote share is needed. This constituency is always unpredictable because of the huge number of candidates. Aodhán Ó Ríordáin’s passage to regain a seat is helped hugely by the retirements of Finian McGrath and Tommy Broughan. If he does not win, Labour can pack up and call it a day.3. Kildare South: There is an extra seat in this constituency. A six point increase is needed. The addition of a seat will favour Mark Wall to take a position once held by his father, Jack. However, he needs to spread his support beyond his Athy base and may be vulnerable to Fianna Fáil’s Suzanne Doyle, or an asymmetric challenge from two strong Independents.4. Cork North-Central: Target is Solidarity-People Before Profit. Five per cent increase needed compared to 2016 election. Solidarity’s Mick Barry will struggle to recapture 15 per cent of the vote from 2016 but will not lose his seat easily. Labour’s John Maher performed well in the byelections and has established a profile after winning a council seat. Labour has not really recovered fully here after being floored in 2016. Maher may be in contention for the last seat but confidence has ebbed a little since start of campaign.5. Waterford:  Target is an Independent seat. A four-point increase is required. With John Halligan’s resignation, there will be a spare seat here. The big parties each have one seat and Labour looks the best placed of the small parties to benefit, through John Pratt. He will have to fend off Marc Ó Cathasaigh of the Greens who are growing here but also – more immediately – Cllr Matt Shanahan, the Independent who has led the high-profile campaign to improve services at Waterford hospital. Pratt may be behind the curve a little here.6. Dublin South-Central: Target is Fine GaelPeople Before Profit. A four percentage-point boost is needed. Like Dublin Bay North, this constituency will involve a scramble for the last seat. If Labour stays ahead of Greens and other left-leaning candidates, Rebecca Moynihan could come close. She is a very impressive candidate but it’s a slightly long shot.7. Kildare North:  Target is Fianna Fáil. A four-point increase is needed. Veteran Emmet Stagg was not that far away in 2016. He will need to stay ahead of the Greens and then rely on heavy transfers from them. Marginal.8. Dublin Central: There is an extra seat here. A five-point increase is needed. Another veteran Joe Costello is the Labour standard bearer and will be in the mix in the final shake-up. Might not happen this time though. Unlikely.9. Dún Laoghaire: Cllr Juliet O’Connell has had an impressive breakthrough year after getting elected as a councillor last year. She’s still comparatively new though and might suffer a slight profile deficit, given her late entry into the race. It must not be forgotten Labour held a seat here for many years but to win she would really have to dislodge Richard Boyd Barrett, who holds the sole left-wing seat in the constituency. Very slim chance.1. Longford-Westmeath: Potential loss to Fine GaelFianna Fáil. Possibility is high. Willie Penrose is retiring having defied all odds, and laws of gravity, in 2016. It’s hard to see Labour retaining this seat even though former county footballer, Alan Mangan, has a high profile.2. Dublin West: to Green PartySinn Féin. Possibility is high. The Greens look poised to win a seat here, with Fine Gael seeking a second seat, and Sinn Féin is also poised to take a seat at the expense of Ruth Coppinger. Joan Burton held the seat here in 2016 against the odds but you sense the tide might have run out on her.3. Limerick City:  Jan O’Sullivan looked comparatively safe until Sinn Féin managed to get back on the pitch. If Fianna Fáíl gets a second seat here it could be at her expense. She survived in 2016 and she is likely to survive again.1. Dún Laoghaire: Extra seat. A 10-point boost is needed. If the party does not win a seat here, there will be no Green surge. It had a big local election here and should win its first seat in the constituency.2. Dublin West: Target is LabourSolidarity Party. An eight-point increase is required. Green Party chairman Roderic O’Gorman has been its candidate here for some time now and is expected to win a seat on the back of a really strong local election performance by him and colleagues.3. Dublin Bay North: Target is Sinn FéinIndependent. An eight-point rise is required. The party was nowhere here in 2016 but again the momentum is with it after the local elections in a constituency where it did particularly well. David Healy won’t get it easy though and will have to fight it out with the Social Democrats, Independent John Lyons, and Labour for two seats.4. Dublin Central: Extra seat. A seven percentage-point increase is needed. The party did well in both local election areas with Ciarán Cuffe topping the poll in the north inner city. Its leader on Dublin City Council Neasa Hourigan is the candidate. She is impressive. She seems slightly ahead of Garry Gannon of the Social Democrats in the race for the final seat.5. Dublin South-West: Target is an Independent seat. An eight-point increase is needed. The party will have an impact on Fine Gael and the Independent Minister Katherine Zappone. It elected councillors comfortably in all the middle-class areas of the constituency and Cllr Francis Noel Duffy (the husband of deputy leader Catherine Martin) is favoured to take a seat.6. Cork South-Central: Target is Sinn Féin. A six point boost is required. Lorna Bogue will need to mount a huge challenge to dislodge Sinn Féin’s Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire for the last seat in a constituency of heavy hitters Micheál Martin, Michael McGrath and Simon Coveney are the other TDs. She is very much on the left of the party and will compete for transfers from smaller groups and left-leaning Independents.7. Wicklow:  Target is Fianna FáilFine Gael. A six-point increase is needed. The party is hardly above five per cent in Wicklow but can benefit from transfers in a constituency where there are always multiple candidates. Fianna Fáil (Stephen Donnelly) and Sinn Féin votes are both expected to drop somewhat and the Green candidate Steven Matthews had an impressive haul of votes in the locals last year. With so many candidates, including Valerie Cox, it might be too big an ask.8. Galway West:  Target is Fine GaelIndependent. A six-point increase in vote share from 2016 is required. Pauline O’Reilly is a strong candidate who will be in the mix after the party had a good local elections in Galway City and in Connemara. The question is how strong the vote will be outside the city. She is also competing against Catherine Connolly for votes who is very strong in the city. There is also the impressive Niall Ó Tuathail of the Social Democrats and Sinn Féin’s Mairéad Farrell is now back in the frame. No certainty at all.9. Waterford: Target is an Independent seat. A six-point increase is required. There is a seat for the taking by a smaller party in Waterford with Halligan standing down. Former senator Grace O’Sullivan would have been a strong favourite if she had not run for Europe. Her replacement Marc Ó Cathasaigh will need to battle hard to break through against a strong challenge from Labour and from Matt Shanahan. He might just snatch it.10. Kildare North: Target is Fianna Fáíl. A seven-point increase in vote share is required. A commuter constituency where the Greens made a big breakthrough in the local elections winning three seats on the council. Naas-based Vincent P Martin, brother of deputy leader Catherine Martin, is a smooth campaigner and will give Fianna Fáíl a run for its money in the battle for the last seat.11. Louth: Target is Independent. A five-point increase of vote share is required. There were high hopes a decade ago that Mark Dearey might make a breakthrough for the Greens here. The former senator is a popular figure but would need to double the party’s vote in the constituency.12. Clare: This is another constituency which has seen a candidate or party emerge out of nowhere. There’s definitely a seat for an Independent or smaller party here following the retirement of Michael Harty. Róisín Garvey is a straight-talking west Clare woman who has made a big impact and will be vying with Michael McNamara for that seat.1. Dublin Central: Extra seat. A one-point increase is needed. Gary Gannon changed local electoral areas in the locals and was comfortably elected. He came very close in 2016, enjoys a high profile and will be in a battle with the Greens, Fianna Fáil and Labour for one of the final two seats here.2. Dublin Bay North: Target is Sinn FéinIndependents. Another very solid Social Democrats performer is Cian O’Callaghan. The forward momentum of the Greens and John Lyons might stymie his chances though.3. Galway West: Target is Fine GaelIndependent. A five-point increase in vote share required. Niall Ó Tuathail was another Social Democrats’ star in 2016 with a strong showing in Galway West. Has he maintained the progress? Some would consider it ill advised for him not to have contested the local election. Council seats are seen as springboards for national politics. Still in with a strong chance.4. Wicklow: Target is Fianna Fáil. Jennifer Whitmore had a very good local election and topped the poll in Greystones, Donnelly’s stomping ground. He got 20 per cent last time when he ran for the Social Democrats. But a lot of that was a personal vote. Wicklow can be very unpredictable. Nobody knows how well Donnelly will do flying under the Fianna Fáil banner. Valerie Cox is an unknown quantity. Whitmore could very well be in contention for the final seat if she manages to capitalise on her local election performance.1. Cork North-Central: to Labour Party. Mick Barry had 15 per cent of the vote here in 2016 but the signs in the local elections, and in the recent byelection, were ominous. He is going to struggle but his vote will certainly be higher than the locals suggested. Facing threats from Labour and, possibly, the Greens.2. Dublin South-Central: to Fianna Fáil. Bríd Smith won with only a handful of votes to spare in 2016 and could be vulnerable this time to Fianna Fáil, the Greens, the Social Democrats and Labour. Some see this as a battle between her and Joan Collins in that left-wing space, even though both are based in different parts of the constituency.3. Dubin Mid-West: to IndependentGreens or Sinn Féin. Gino Kenny came from nowhere to win a seat in 2016 and this popular and sincere TD might just hang on, partly on the back of his championing medicinal cannabis, which has given him a national profile. There are two left-wing seats in the constituency, and Sinn Féin is now looking to win a second. Another threat will come from an Independent candidate, possibly Paul Gogarty.4. Dublin West: Vulnerable to Sinn Féin. Ruth Coppinger has been an indefatigable worker and has a national profile. But so do the other TDs, Leo Varadkar, Burton and Jack Chambers. Her seat is under huge threat.5. Dún Laoghaire: To Fianna Fáil or the Greens. There has always been a left-wing seat in this constituency, and Richard Boyd Barrett might just hold on to it. However, that would mean getting in ahead of one of the two big parties, or the Greens.6. Dublin South-West: to Fianna Fail or Greens. It’s very hard to predict how Paul Murphy will fare, in his new role as the sole Rise TD in the Dáil. He did very well in 2016 on the back of the water protests but might find it difficult to maintain his support levels in the constituency. The decision by Solidarity to run Sandra Fay against her former party colleagues sounds ludicrous and could have an adverse impact on him. Both are running under the S-PBP banner.1. Dublin Mid-West (Paul Gogarty): Target is People Before Profit. Gogarty could take the fourth seat on the back of a reasonably good outing in the byelection.2. Sligo-Leitrim (Marian Harkin): Target is Fianna Fáil. The former MEP and TD has a very big cachet in the constituency and was wooed by Fine Gael. That offer might play a bit against her but she will be a threat to Fianna Fáíl.3. Wexford (Verona Murphy): Target is Fine Gael. Murphy is as well-known as she is controversial and early in the campaign was seen poised to take a seat at the expense of Paul Kehoe. However, Sinn Féin’s Johnny Mythen might top the poll and that might put paid to her chances.4. Clare (Michael McNamara): Target is IndependentFine Gael. There is an outgoing Independent TD, Michael Harty, who is retiring. Clare has a tradition of electing Independents and it might prove lucky for the former Labour Party TD.5. Waterford (Matt Shanahan): The “hospital candidate” has a very high profile locally and loss of hospital services is always a touchstone issue. Shanahan is in with a chance and will be vying with the Greens and Labour for the final seat.5. Dublin Bay North (John Lyons): The former People Before Profit councillor has an excellent track record on Dublin City Council and could cause an upset here against one of the three smaller left-leaning parties vying for the final seat.1. Laois-Offaly (Carol Nolan): Laois and Offaly were two separate three-seat constituencies in 2016. Now, it’s a five-seater and former Sinn Féin TD Carol Nolan could be the obvious loser.2. Tipperary (Seamus Healy): to Fine Gael. Healy has been a great survivor but a change of mood might see him struggle.3. Donegal (Thomas Pringle): to Sinn Féin. Pringle has also been a solid vote-getter but Sinn Féin has been working really hard since 2016 to regain a seat.4. Galway East (Seán Canney): to Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. Canney is a Minister of State and a hard constituency worker but will find it hard to resist the two bigger parties. His best hope is to stay ahead of their Tuam-based candidates.5. Dublin South-West (Katherine Zappone): to GreensFianna Fáil.Very hard to gauge how the Minister for Children will do. She benefitted from anti-establishment transfers in 2016 but may be able to trade on her performance as Minister with another set of voters.6. Dublin Rathdown (Shane Ross): to Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil: This is a very fickle constituency and this year’s poll topper is next year’s also-ran. Ross’s star has been waning here and his is under strong pressure from Neale Richmond and (surprisingly) Shay Brennan. However, he seems a little stronger now than at this time last year, having considerably upped his performance as Minister.8. Louth (Peter Fitzpatrick): to Fine Gael. It’s hard to know how the Independent TD, formerly of Fine Gael, will do without a party banner. He is the chairman of Louth GAA this year and that is always a boon. But there are some very big hitters among his rivals and it will be difficult for him to survive.Harry McGee is political correspondent with The The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4162693.1580917885!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"saoirse mchugh selling her green vision to rural ireland","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Saoirse McHugh, the Green Party’s candidate for Mayo,  chatting to Vincent Barrett while on the campaign trail in Foxford. Photograph: Bryan O’Brien One day last week Green Party candidate Saoirse McHugh called to a house while canvassing in Mayo and talked to the woman there. It was evening and she getting dinner ready for her family.“I’d say I was there about 45 minutes. I was just having the craic with her,” she says, happily recalling the encounter. “She literally got a plate out and was taking stuff off all her family’s plates to give me some dinner.”‘She was saying, ‘you will have a dinner won’t you’?”It was cold and McHugh was starving and had to force herself to decline.Mc Hugh talks about “having the craic” a lot when she talks about canvassing. She would like to visit every door in the county, but that’s not possible, especially during a three-week campaign in January.“I spent way too long at doors and way too long at shops talking to people. You can’t rush people and say ‘vote for me. Bye now’. If you looking for somebody’s vote, you have the courtesy of listening to them.”In Foxford, McHugh meets a friendly, chatty man who stands solid in the doorway with his arms folded. His name is Vincent Barrett.“I’m into fishing and shooting. We can’t go out and shoot. They took the fishing licences off us,” he tells her. “Now the guns we have, we are not supposed to shoot, There is lead in the cartridges. I used just go out for a walk and go with the dog and have a shot at a woodcock. I cannot remember the last time I shot a bird. We cannot cut the turf either. That is gone.”Smelling saltsFor an urban Green, the smelling salts would be coming out at that stage. McHugh doesn’t blink an eye at the exchange and is full of sympathy. This is country life and she is part of it too.A rural Green, she sets out her vision for rural Ireland. “I think Mayo can be brilliant. We can have all of the land and all of the fishing. if we owned the windmills we could own all the electricity.“Mayo needs a 50-year plan,” she says. “Young people are leaving. It does not have to be that way at all. We can bring life back into the towns and villages and stop people driving long distances.”She also sympathises with beef farmers, who are “having an awful time” of it.“With climate action they can have a great opportunity. They will never compete in terms of kilos produced. If they help carbon sinks on wet lands or boglands they can get paid for that, or get paid for having wildlife on a farm.”Twenty minutes of chat later and Barrett is telling her she will get his number one.Earlier that Sunday morning, McHugh is getting ready at the Mall in Castlebar for the day’s canvass. She cuts a distinctive figure. She is tall, wears no make-up, and her curly hair is tied back in a bun. What marks her out it a bright yellow hooded puffa jacket which has become her uniform during the campaign. Like everything about her, it is dramatic.When she speaks she mimics other people, and acts out exaggerated responses to what she says. She is unspun and unrehearsed and tells you exactly what she thinks in an unreconstructed Mayo accent.The transport is her partner Colm Cafferky’s electric Renault which squashes in five people. He is the campaign organiser, and is a quiet, pleasant, laid-back presence all day.McHugh first burst into the public consciousness during the European elections last year. The Achill Islander effectively put down rival Peter Casey in a debate on Prime Time and briefly looked like she might snatch a seat in Midlands North-West on the back of an opinion poll.She was young and fresh-faced, fired up with passion and youthful idealism, and was not afraid to share her views (even when they didn’t fully accord with party policy). She immediately became a lodestar for younger Greens.Then she became the Green Party candidate for Mayo in the general election. A tough ask. The party won just 1 per cent of votes in the local elections here. And it is as rural and traditional as they come.So it was always going to be a long shot. Her chances of winning a seat also narrowed since the Sinn Féin surge which has put Rose Conway-Walsh right in the frame. But McHugh has made her mark in this campaign, not least by causing a ruckus or two.Small beef farmersFor one, she ran a counter-protest in Achill when some locals opposed emergency accommodation for asylum seekers. That was a brave move. She has made “over my dead body” pronouncements about going into government with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáíl and declared herself an anti-capitalist. She supports domestic turf-cutting and small beef farmers.And most isively of all, she has opposed carbon taxes. There seem to be Green policies and a separate category of Saoirse McHugh policies. “They all think I’m a People Before Profit mole,” she jokes.There’s a paradox here. On one hand she erges from party policy because she is more radical. But on the other, she is far more conservative about climate action in some areas, especially on rural Ireland.She sets out her case for her own people: “It feels that everyone in Achill commutes to either Westport or Castlebar. That’s 60 kilometres each way.“A price on carbon has to serve a purpose. Unless there is an alternative, it will disproportionately affect the communities I know. And make things worse for them.“People can’t afford to retrofit in rural Ireland. Public transport does not exist. They need their cars. Carbon tax has to be done in a way that approves quality of life.“Myself and my partner live across the road from my mum and dad. We have to have four cars.“A lot of that in rural Ireland is because villages and towns are shutting down and there is no plan to keep them alive because 10 years ago I could walk to a shop and post office and now I have to drive.”On turf-cutting she says: “You can’t tell people you have to stop extracting peat to heat your homes unless an alternative is found.”“People in the Greens are quite like, ’That’s just Saoirse, it’s fine’, I think.”So why strike the Saoirse line?“I am a terrible liar,” she says. “The Greens are open to speaking their minds. I have prepped for interviews before and I get to what should be my line and it just does not come out and I say the wrong thing, which is the true thing.”But the radical stuff is there too. She says it’s better for a party like hers to stay true to it, rather than dilute the message. So for her, the Greens accommodate not ided views, but a spectrum.But, she says she would consider it if they came in sackcloth and ashes over their wasteful and neoliberal ways, and laid out a wonderful plan.Does she have a chance? “Some minutes I think I will top the poll. Next I think I will get 10 votes,” she says. “I definitely think there’s a seat in Mayo for something new.”The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons february 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Comment: Trump is set to win again – and he\u0026#39ll do it on substance, not theatrics How Donald Trump will weaponise his impeachment acquittal against vulnerable DemocratsRadio 3 boasts highest audience ratings in three years while Radio 1 plunges to record lowBoris Johnson sends Dominic Raab to Australia to seek early trade dealTeenage girl launches judicial review against guidance which says she must share lavatories with trans girlsBritish women among most dissatisfied in the world at their breast sizeAnalysis: Can Donald Trump become the first impeached president in history to be re-elected?Donald Trump acquitted on both articles of impeachment, keeping him in White HouseMore Chinese students than Welsh apply to British universities for the first time, Ucas figures showPlug-in hybrid cars emit three times more CO2 in ‘real world’ drivingSajid Javid says grants for electric cars won\u0026#39t be scrapped as row over hybrid ban ragesSocial media bosses to be held liable for online harms with threat of prosecution for breachesComment: Even privatisation may come too late to save an increasingly irrelevant BBCMinisters in race against time to introduce terror laws before release of offender on February 28Stilton cheese cannot be made in Cambridge village of same name because of \u0026#39EU bureaucracy\u0026#39BBC licence fee could be gone by 2027, Culture Secretary indicates French sports world in turmoil as top athletes demand end to \u0026#39culture of silence\u0026#39 as ice skating rape claims growTheresa May allies say \u0026#39she has the stature\u0026#39 to head UN climate change conferenceDoctors should not screen women for FGM as it might deter them from seeking medical help, Royal College of GPs sayAnti-semitic attacks and abuse hit a record high as Labour rows are blamed for fuelling surgeWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit heroleo varadkar staring barrel defeat irish election","story":"When he became Irish Taoiseach in 2017 Leo Varadkar had a sprinkle of stardust. The gay, half Indian medical doctor was the changing face of modern Ireland.A year after taking office he oversaw the abolition of strict abortion laws and on the international stage he bravely stood up to the British over Brexit. All the while, the economy boomed.But as Ireland heads towards an election this Saturday the 41-year-old progressive -  often mentioned in the same breath as Justin Trudeau in Canada, Emmanuel Macron in France and Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand - is facing defeat.While success on the international stage has won him plaudits, critics at home claim that Mr Varadkar has become arrogant, aloof and not interested in key domestic issues, like healthcare and housing.In Dublin’ cranes swing overhead and the streets are clogged by the movement of hundreds of construction workers employed at what is supposed to be Ireland\u0027s state-of-the-art National Children’s Hospital.Part of a key pledge by Mr Varadkar\u0027s Fine Gael party to fix Ireland\u0027s broken healthcare system, the facility was supposed to open this year for a cost of €650 million.Three years behind schedule and with costs spiralling into the billions, the hospital is one of the reasons that the sheen has come off Mr Varadkar’s premiership.The debacle at the National Children’s Hospital is symptomatic of chaos across the healthcare sector.Hospital waiting lists have reached record levels. There is also a chronic shortage of housing. Young people are unable to get on the housing ladder and quite often cannot afford spiralling rents in Dublin and other cities.Homelessness has also become a major campaign issue. Last year, a photo of a young boy eating his evening meal on a pedestrianised shopping street in the centre of Dublin captured the human cost of the unfolding crisis.In the working class area around the proposed children’s hospital, there is anger at the escalating cost of the project.Maureen O’Mahony, 74, says her main concerns are “jobs for my grandchildren and somewhere they can live”. She used to vote for the Labour Party, but on Saturday she is thinking of going with Sinn Fein or the hard Left.Maureen\u0027s wider constituency is rapidly gentrifying. Cian O’Riordan, 28, a computer science graduate who works in an IT start-up in the area should be the young millennial that fits the mould as a Varadkar voter.Angry about being squeezed out of the housing market by rapidly rising prices, he says he hasn’t made up his mind yet what way he will vote - except that it definitely won’t be for Fine Gael.It has become a rubric of all elections that they are won or lost based on the state of the economy. This is clearly not the case in Ireland.When Fine Gael came to power in 2011 Ireland was in an EU-IMF bailout programme following a spectacular property market crash unemployment was more than 15 per cent, and the national debt had ballooned from 25 per cent of GDP in 2007 to 123 per cent in the space of four years. Also, in 2011, the budget deficit hit 32 per cent of GDP following the rescue of the banking system.Ireland has been the fastest growing economy in the EU for the past six years. Unemployment is at a thirteen year low of 4.8 per cent, national debt is 63.6 per cent of GDP and there was a budget surplus of just under 1 per cent for last year.Mr Varadkar’s handling of Brexit negotiations helped push his popularity to record levels. His implacable resistance to any border on the island of Ireland risked becoming the gordian knot of talks to secure a Withdrawal Agreement. In the end he prevailed.But the Withdrawal Bill was agreed last October. If a week is a long time in politics, then three months is an eternity.Fine Gael traditionally draws its support from urban middle class voters and farmers. But its appeal to these voters has ebbed in recent months. The failure to roll out broadband has provoked a backlash from rural Ireland. The government has also clashed with farmers over beef prices. And even the middle classes are not immune to problems in the housing and health sectors.“On paper the Fine Gael-led Government has done well on key economic indicators,” Eoin O’Malley, professor of politics at Dublin City University, says. “But people have greater expectations of government now, and the housing policy has failed - or it has not succeeded quickly enough. The rent crisis is real and felt by a whole generation.” Mr O’Malley says the other problem for Fine Gael is that it’s been in government for nine years.In a poll released on Monday, Fine Gael was in third place on a rating of 20 per cent, behind Fianna Fail on 23 per cent and Sinn Fein on 25 per cent. If these support levels pan out on election day, then Fine Gael faces a meltdown at the polls.Fine Gael and Fianna Fail have given Sinn Fein a boost, in part by cosying up to other parties such as the Greens as potential coalition partners, Mr O’Malley says. “They’ve taken the edginess off the Greens, and so a vote for other ‘protest’ parties doesn’t look like change, only Sinn Fein does. So I’m not sure we can say Sinn Fein has run a terribly good election, it just became the party to vote for if you are sick of the other lot.”Unless Fine Gael has a Lazarus type recovery in the final days of the campaign before voters go to the polls on Saturday, then Leo Varadkar will be heading to the opposition benches. That is unless Fianna Fail and Fine Gael set aside their historical enmities and form a grand coalition for the first time in the history of the state.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed plug in hybrid cars emit three times co2 real world","story":"A new generation of ‘plug-in’ hybrid cars emit up to three times more greenhouse gases in ‘real world’ driving than official figures suggest.A series of studies found the fuel consumption in the plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) was far greater on the road than claimed.PHEVs are powered by a combination of battery-powered electric motor and a traditional combustion engine. But they only have a short range in electric mode - typically of between 15 and 25 miles - amid warnings motorists are neglecting to charge them and instead choosing to run them on petrol only.In a shock announcement on Tuesday, ministers said sales of new hybrid cars would be banned from 2035 onwards. But experts said last night PHEVs could actually be emitting more CO2 than equivalent petrol-only cars, which are more fuel efficient because they are not as heavy as hybrids which have to carry extra weight of a battery and motor.One study by The Miles Consultancy (TMC), a specialist motoring company  which conducted an audit of fuel consumption of PHEVs among fleet drivers, found that the most popular PHEV cars - manufactured by  BMW, Mitsubishi, Mercedes and Volkswagen - routinely returned fuel consumption figures two-and-a-half to three times higher than official claims.Correspondingly cars with official CO2 emissions of less than 50gkm are actually emitting more than 150gkm under real driving conditions, said experts.The findings are backed up by an academic study conducted in Norway in 2018 on plug-in hybrids which concluded that “the average yearly estimated CO2-emission was about 2.5 times higher than the value stated in the type approval official CO2-emission test”.A third series of tests by Emissions Analytics, which examined fuel consumption on PHEVs when the batteries had not been charged, also showed alarmingly high fuel consumption.Company car drivers may be incentivised to fill up with petrol - using company credit cards - rather than charge cars at home and pay the fuel bills themselves.Paul Hollick, TMC’s managing director, said: “There is a real risk that drivers are adopting PHEVs for completely the right reasons but unknowingly actually increasing their fuel bills.”He added: “On the evidence of our sample, one has to question whether some PHEVs ever see a charging cable. In a lot of cases, we see PHEVs never being charged, doing longer drives and this is not a good fit for a lot of car users.”One of the most popular plug in hybrids - the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV - returned 39.1mpg under the Emissions Analytics test, when running on an empty battery, compared to an official fuel consumption it said was being claimed of 148.5mpg.TMC’s audit of 101 Mitsubishi Outlander PHEVs found the actual fuel economy was 41mpg. TMC’s audit of other makes found similar disparities including a popular Mercedes C class hybrid that retuned 39mpg in the real world. TMC said the official fuel economy was 130mpg.TMC recorded an average of 42mpg on 187 BMWs that were they being charged regularly should have returned an average of 137mpg. Volkswagens returned real driving consumption of 52mpg compared to 163mpg.Last night, the Government’s own experts on climate change questioned the effectiveness of PHEVs, which have attracted sizeable tax breaks for company car owners. The motoring industry estimates sales of PHEVs will more than double in Europe this year from 220,000 up to 590,000.Ewa Kmietowicz, Transport Team Leader at the Committee on Climate Change, said: “When charged appropriately, plug-in hybrid vehicles allow drivers to complete the majority of trips in all-electric mode.“However, there is a concern that plug-in hybrids are not being used as intended, achieving less than one-third of miles in electric mode, and risking higher emissions. By the end of the year, most new models of fully electric vehicle will be able to cover 150 miles on a single charge, and the need for plug-in hybrids will inevitably decline.”Nick Molden, chief executive of Emissions Analytics, said: “This is all very confusing for motorists. The problem is the official figures are very sensitive to assumptions about how PHEVs are being charged and driven.”Mr Molden said fuel consumption was actually higher when the batteries were not charged because of the added weight of PHEVs.A Mitsubishi UK spokesman said: “The Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV was originally tested for emissions and fuel economy in a fully charged state and the additional performance that the energy stored in the battery provides naturally has a significant impact on its overall efficiency.“We state in our promotional material that the official figures are only for comparison to similar vehicles and that they may not reflect real life driving results.”Following the studies, Mike Hawes, The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders Ltd Chief Executive, said: “ We can’t comment on non-official tests where the methodology is unclear. Only the official tests allow reliable, repeatable, like for like comparison between vehicles in the real world.“Manufacturers have invested heavily over many years to ensure a full range of low, ultra low and zero emission technologies to give motorists a choice, based on their inidual driving needs.“Plug-in hybrids are one such choice that gives drivers flexibility, allowing them to drive for extended periods with zero emissions as well as extended range. Consumers are choosing these vehicles for their environmental performance and lower running costs.”The Department for Transport said: “Our £1.5bn Road to Zero strategy supports consumers and businesses with incentives and these will continue to play a role beyond 2020. Plug-in hybrid cars can deliver significant emissions savings compared to petrol and diesel cars.“Subsidies will encourage the uptake of the cleanest technologies available, helping us reach our ambitious net zero targets.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/02/05/TELEMMGLPICT000211747039_1_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=4","title":"students have always unpatriotic new professors now share wokery","story":"Cambridge University Students’ Union (trigger warning: violent metaphor) has come under fire for ruling that the presence of soldiers at freshers’ fair could “detrimentally affect” students’ mental health, voting through a motion banning any society, such as the cadets, from bringing firearms along to the event. In 2018, CUSU also voted down a motion to promote Remembrance Sunday amid fears it could “glorify” conflict.Coming from the university that produced Philby, Burgess, Blunt and Maclean, this all seems relatively small beer. But it embodies the entitled victimhood engulfing our campuses and, increasingly, public life – the jarring mixture of performative frailty with a decidedly totalitarian instinct. Some have contrasted student behaviour of today with previous generations of undergraduates who served their nation in existential wars. There is some truth to this, but it misses a broader point.Undergraduates now may not possess the stoic courage of Rupert Brooke, facing death while yearning for the blooming lilacs of Grantchester. Yet how many of us – whether anxiety-ridden millennials or binge-drinking baby boomers – embody the resilience, discipline or self-sacrifice of the war generation? Students have long been less patriotic than the general public, and often adopt extreme stances pour épater la bourgeoisie.In 1933, the Oxford Union debated and carried the now-notorious motion “This House will in no circumstances fight for its King and Country”, prompting the Union’s short-term financial ruin as traditionally-minded fathers refused to pay their sons’ subscriptions. Student life in the Sixties was famed for its activism, albeit without today’s censoriousness. Youthful fervour often proves fleeting, just as many of those who supported the 1933 motion ultimately fought and died for King and Country.What has shifted is the broader climate of debate, for which adults are equally culpable. Scratch the surface and university staff are often found leading the latest assault on free speech or tedious wokeness drive – Cambridge has specialised in this kind of gesture politics. “Social justice” mobs demanding the scalps of dissenting academics can only succeed with the help of willing allies in the faculty. The question is not why students are revolting, but why adults keep giving into them.Winston Churchill, left, pictured in 1894 during his time at Sandhurst, described the 1933 Oxford Union debate entitled \u0026#39This House will in no circumstances fight for its King and Country\u0026#39 as \u0026#39abject, squalid, shameless\u0026#39 and \u0026#39nauseating\u0026#39It doesn’t help that the professoriate has become dominated by the Left. The author Jonathan Haidt believes this shift to be demographic politically erse academics from the “greatest generation” retiring in the 1990s were replaced by Left-leaning baby boomers, veterans of the ‘68 generation. One recent report by the Adam Smith Institute estimated that less than 12 per cent of UK academics would vote for a Right-wing party. This minority, occasionally visible in science or economics faculties, is virtually extinct in fields like literature and sociology – and many stay silent in practice, fearing reprisals.That academics have moved Left, while the public has not, exacerbates a cultural chasm between graduates and non-graduates, most obvious in the case of Brexit. Yet the implications of campus monoculture are dwarfed by the intellectual harm to students.CUSU’s attitude symbolises so much about what has gone wrong the wilful refusal to accept reality and a complete lack of empathy for anyone who sees things differently. Their failure to recognise war and defence as unavoidable realities goes further than naivete – it suggests deep intellectual shortcomings. It is a case study in more than anti-military sentiment.It needn’t be like this. Last week, Andrew Parker, the bursar of St John’s College, Oxford, offered the perfect riposte to a group of students calling for the college to abandon its fossil fuel investments. “I am not able to arrange any estment at short notice,” he replied. “But I can arrange for the gas central heating to be switched off with immediate effect.”The protesters, predictably, branded his words “inappropriate and flippant”. Yet this simple reply serves as an antidote to our febrile environmental debate, at once challenging his students and highlighting unexplored complexities. Sadly, Parker and his ilk are in the vanishing minority. Our universities have become havens for groupthink – the very thing they were established to counteract.University of CambridgeThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Whatabout-ery, I think they call it.Sure, you might have sold your car but what about the fact you went on holiday abroad last year? Sure, you might eat only vegan but what about the fact you use a gas oven to cook? Sure, you might, while still a teenager, have single-handedly inspired your entire generation to rise up and put climate change on the global agenda — but what about the fact you allowed yourself to be interviewed by a BBC journalist who took a flight to conduct it?All fair questions perhaps but, then, I can do a bit of whatabout-ery myself.I’m promising to be a more sustainable parent to save the planetThat is to say: unless the people who ask these questions live in electric-less, hand-woven wigwams, eat only foraged plants and drink nowt but stream water, what about them slinging their hooks and letting the rest of us do our bit in the rational, everyday way we can? What about that, fellas?There is a serious point here. Such criticism — with its purer-than-thou platitudes and virtue-signalling standpoints — is the quickest way to achieve mass turn-off, when, in fact, dealing with the climate crisis is absolutely dependent on mass buy-in. Indeed, dependent on a million people like you and I making the small changes that will ultimately equate to huge differences.Which is why, despite being a monster who brought a resource-guzzling, air-polluting, land-filling person into the world, I’m still going to try and, you know, recycle a bit more, maybe use the car a bit less, eat a bit of veggie here and there. It all adds up.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our ultimate aim is to produce no waste in our everyday life, whether we’re at home, at work or school, socialising, on holiday or getting from A to B.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesFive key steps I\u0027m taking to reduce my plastic use this yearFrom food packaging to clothes, cleaning products to kids’ toys, we try our damnedest not to produce any waste that wouldn’t compost. That means we don’t use single-use plastic, for example. We try not to buy any new plastic at all in fact, including synthetic material. There isn’t a single bin in our house.\u0026nbspAt first, with two very young children and both of us working full time, the shift felt extreme. Sometimes it still does.\u0026nbspWe don’t bother with supermarkets, corner shops or service stations anymore because everything is wrapped in plastic. We buy our food in jars, metal containers and bags we take with us to shops where we weigh out what we need. Overnight we stopped buying any pre-prepared food and most takeaways, everything is cooked from absolute scratch.\u0026nbspIn the bathroom, we switched to soap from shower gels and bottled shampoo, our toothbrushes are bamboo, my son wears reusable nappies (a revelation as it turned out) and we make our own cleaning products (easier and more effective than I expected).If we buy things for our home, they are secondhand and made from natural materials if at all possible, including clothes, furniture, electrical appliances if we can’t fix what we have or borrow something, DIY materials like paint, you name it.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Climate change: Decade\u0027s defining issue in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In this decade, humans have become ever more aware of climate change.

We now do it a better way, I believe, for my family’s health, my children’s future and the local, national and global environment they will still be calling home long after I’m food for worms.\u0026nbspTaking matters into our own hands has been empowering to the point of intoxicating. It has helped curb a fair bit of eco-anxiety, we’ve lost a few pounds and, contrary to popular belief, it has already saved us a small fortune.\u0026nbspUpping the ante on our waste has also refocused our minds on other damaging aspects of our modern life, so we don’t fly anymore, our diet is increasingly plant-based and our car is electric. We’re trying to reduce the amount of water we use and take care of what we put down the drain, that kind of thing.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s normal, and it’s a lot easier than it used to be because it’s normal. We’ve got over the hurdles of our first zero waste Christmas, holiday, birthday party. This is how it is going to be, how we believe it needs to be for the rest of our lives.\u0026nbspOur families and friends, work colleagues and schoolmates have stopped assuming this is a phase, or just ignoring our wishes, and have started asking for support as they cut down waste themselves.\u0026nbspWhy eating with the seasons in January is harder than it soundsAnd yet at the back of my head I’ve got doubts. I can’t shake the idea that I’m kidding myself over what we’re really achieving with all this.\u0026nbspIt’s not that we’re too insignificant to make a difference. We get that thrown at us a lot, mostly from people who somehow think our lifestyle decisions are all about judging them and get defensive.I obviously don’t agree anyway. I have two tiny children and I refuse to believe that I can’t help protect their future. My usual response is “It’s only one plastic bag, said 7 billion people”. I think I stole it off Instagram or something.\u0026nbspNo, my nagging doubt is about what truths I might find if I dig a bit deeper.\u0026nbspTake something simple, like recycling. Most of the nation does it in some way. Ours is almost exclusively metal and glass, and there’s a lot less of it than there used to be.\u0026nbspBut I know the recycling process requires transport, energy to transform the material and more energy to reintroduce the renewed item back into the consuming system. Should we be “zero recycling” too?And, if you start thinking about it, what about the environmental impact of the restaurants we go? The places we stay away from home? How our friends make the food we eat when we visit? If I really want to see this through, should I be asking our local café what they have had to throw in the bin to make me that sandwich? If they have, should I stop using it? Should I stop supporting my local economy, adding to the risk that it closes and people who live in my little town have to start driving miles for a cuppa and a cake?\u0026nbspWhat about all the non-physical consuming I do? What’s the carbon impact of the email I’ll send my editor about this blog post?If I pursue zero waste to its limits, will I ultimately find that there are almost no services I can use? Will a truly zero waste life effectively mean dropping out of society? And if so, which compromise is one too far? Where do I draw the line between looking after the environment and looking after my family and myself? How much effort am I willing to make and at what cost?Because these last two are the questions I suspect we’re all asking about our environmental responsibilities right now, here’s my 2020 pledge. I’m going to up my game, I’m going to go for true zero waste to see what that really means.I’ll review the decisions that have got our family to where we are now, do the research on our real life impact and then take it to extremes to find out what is possible for your average household.\u0026nbspSo, as I say, I’m not sure this is a great idea.\u0026nbspBut I have to try.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Nils Frahm’s music feels most alive when you’re witnessing it in concert, so it makes sense that Spaces, a collection of field recordings made over two years, is his most immersive and dynamic. The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Prince Charles then came on stage and said: “I must say I’m enormously grateful to Katy Perry for such a kind introduction, which she told me just now she wanted to make slightly more spicy, but I think she resisted the temptation.”The decision to appoint Perry an ambassador for the\u0026nbspBritish Asian Trust\u0026nbsphas been heavily criticised on\u0026nbspsocial media, with some accusing the star of encouraging “white saviour” complex.\u0026nbspThe British Asian Trust was founded in 2007 by Prince Charles and a group of British Asian business leaders.The charity supports the estimated 5.8 million children working in forced labour in India with tens of thousands thought to be working in hazardous workshops.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And then it suddenly stopped.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThat rapid and unexplained death has puzzled astronomers, who say the vast galaxy does not fit with our existing models of the early universe.Even before the universe was 2 billion years old,\u0026nbspXMM-2599\u0026nbsphad already formed a mass of more than 300 billion suns, making it an\u0026nbspultramassive\u0026nbspgalaxy, said Benjamin Forrest, the lead author of the study, in a statement.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

It challenges our models of how the early universe exists, they say, and could lead to dramatic changes in our understanding of how stars form – and stop forming.Nasa to add ‘hotel’ capsule to International Space StationIn this epoch, very few galaxies have stopped forming stars, and none are as massive as\u0026nbspXMM-2599, said Gillian Wilson, a professor of physics and astronomy at University of California - Riverside, where the research was conducted.The mere existence of\u0026nbspultramassive\u0026nbspgalaxies like\u0026nbspXMM-2599\u0026nbspproves quite a challenge to numerical models. Even though such massive galaxies are incredibly rare at this epoch, the models do predict them. The predicted galaxies, however, are expected to be actively forming stars.What makes\u0026nbspXMM-2599\u0026nbspso interesting, unusual, and surprising is that it is no longer forming stars, perhaps because it stopped getting fuel or its black hole began to turn on. Our results call for changes in how models turn off star formation in early galaxies.At its peak, the galaxy was forming stars equivalent to\u0026nbspmore than 1,000 of our own suns each year. That is incredibly fast for any galaxy, with our Milky Way forming about one star each year.Because the galaxy is so far away, it has been spotted from a time when the universe was very young. That means that by the present day it could have become something altogether different, and likely equally spectacular.We have caught\u0026nbspXMM-2599\u0026nbspin its inactive phase, Wilson said. We do not know what it will turn into by the present day.We know it cannot lose mass. An interesting question is what happens around it. As time goes by, could it gravitationally attract nearby star-forming galaxies and become a bright city of galaxies?Now the team behind the discovery hopes to use the high-tech equipment at the Keck Observatory to delve more into the galaxy, and hopefully answer the questions thrown up by the bizarre clump of stars.We identified\u0026nbspXMM-2599\u0026nbspas an interesting candidate with imaging alone, said co-author\u0026nbspMarianna\u0026nbspAnnunziatella, a postdoctoral researcher at Tufts University. We used Keck to better\u0026nbspcharacterize\u0026nbspand confirm its nature and help us understand how monster galaxies form and die.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This particular skeleton - on display at the Senckenberg museum in Germany - was found in Alberta, Canada, which is also where the first Euoplocephalus fossil was found in 1897It is believed they journeyed across an ancient land bridge connecting Asia to North America, known as Beringia, during the last Ice Age more than 12,000 years ago, before migrating to the Patagonian region in South America.Dr Silvia Gonzalez, a professor of quaternary geology and geoarchaeology at Liverpool John Moores University, and one of the study authors, told the PA news agency: “The new results are important because they question the ‘traditional model’ for the peopling of the Americas with one single and homogeneous Paleoindian population migrating very fast from Beringia to Patagonia after 12,000 years ago.“Our results indicate that at least two morphologically different Paleoindian populations were coexisting in Mexico between 12,000 to 8,000 years ago, one in Central Mexico and the other in the Yucatan Peninsula.The team, led by Professor Wolfgang Stinnesbeck, an earth scientist at Heidelberg University, dated the skeletal remains using mineral deposits called flowstone which covered some finger bones.They believe Chan Hol 3 to be at least 9,900 years old, if not older.Structural analysis revealed Chan Hol 3 had a round head with broad cheekbones and a flat forehead, resembling three other skulls from the Tulum caves.But according to the researchers, her cranial characteristics are different to the long-headed Paleoindian skeletons found in the region.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That has brought major breakthroughs as researchers have looked more deeply and in more detail at the universe than ever before.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut researchers continue to run up against the problem of dark matter and dark energy, which makes up most of the universe but can only be observed indirectly. Nobody has been able to understand its nature or how it fits into any possible model of the cosmos.Some scientists have hoped to move towards solving this problem with a greater understanding of the structure of the universe. If astronomers are able to understand how our cosmos is made up – generating a full picture of the filaments where galaxies cluster together, and the voids that appear to be empty – then they may be able to give a better picture of what it is made of, and how it works.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

If they were able to build a picture of that journey, it could help iluminate the mystery of dark matter and dark energy.Now a team of scientists has built a new tool called the Dark Emulator, described in a recently published paper in the Astrophysical Journal. They hope it could use artificial intelligence to shed more light on how that structure came about.The technology was built by scientists who used supercomputers belonging to the\u0026nbspNational Astronomical Observatory of Japan. They were able to use that emulator on data taken from many of the world\u0027s largest surveys of the sky, allowing them to examine how the cosmic structures of our universe could have been formed.We built an extraordinarily large database using a supercomputer, which took us three years to finish, but now we can recreate it on a laptop in a matter of seconds. I feel like there is great potential in data science, said lead author\u0026nbspTakahiro\u0026nbsp​Nishimichi\u0026nbspin a statement.Using this result, I hope we can work our way towards uncovering the greatest mystery of modern physics, which is to uncover what dark energy is. I also think this method we\u0027ve developed will be useful in other fields such as natural sciences or social sciences.The tool works by relying on machine learning to create hundreds of virtual universes. They were able to alter important parts of the universe, and generate a picture of how they might have changed the cosmos.The Dark Emulator is able to learn from each of those simulations, allowing it to guess how changes in those characteristics would affect the results. That means it does not need to create entirely new simulations, allowing it to generate another virtual universe far more quickly than ever before.In the paper describing the findings, the researchers describe how it was able to accurately predict specific effects in their virtual universes in just seconds. Similar simulations would take days without using the Dark Emulator, they say.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Look out for that.”So I did, but still can’t isolate the exact moment it arrived at last week’s National Television Awards, on ITV, where the industry had assembled for the th time and, quite possibly, the last as well.If it was the NTA’s farewell, then it’d be a mercy ­killing for an event where shock results have come along about as regularly as Hezbollah ­isions have arrived at the Changing of the Guard.Five years ago, you could’ve bet the house Ant and Dec would claim their th presenting title, and This ­Morning’s Phillip and Holly would milk their tenth consecutive Best Magazine Show hangover, to the point their long-suffering audience were probably feeling homicidal.This year’s only vague surprise being, it transpired, Ant and Dec thought the same way as the viewers, with Dec admitting they: “Feel more and more sick every year.”There was a flip side to all these set-in-stone voting patterns, of course.The NTAs remained the one place on ­television earth where Mrs Brown’s Boys could be relied upon to beat the massively overrated Fleabag.Considering how regimented the actual voting is, though, the far more remarkable thing about the NTAs is that it’s nearly always a shambolic production.Categories come, go, mutate and ide into three drama sections .Some are accompanied by clips . Others, like New Drama, aren’t. It also whores itself out commercially and jumps on every available bandwagon.So David Mitchell trudged on randomly, dressed as Shakespeare, to promote a stage show, and the Impact Award was given to Gavin  Stacey, when it had “Caroline Flack’s bedside lamp” written all over it.A lot of this was down to the fact the NTAs still don’t know their own mind.They want to be both popular and highbrow, which meant poor old Michael Palin was left describing it as “a hotbed of talent”, while the camera went looking for Tess Daly.Through it all , Ant, Dec and This Morning have endured, and it’s possible to have a bit of sympathy for the production, with such stubbornly repetitive voting habits.The NTAs and ITV really are the authors of most of their own misfortune here, though.Insecure television networks need a Best Magazine category, TV awards don’t.Nor do they need a Best Judge, which was the section that eventually lumbered them with four-times winner David Walliams, the trouserless host — a man whose world begins and ends with himself and, when required to do something , like pay tribute to Nicholas Parsons, performs it with all the sincerity of a “mind the gap” announcement.As luck would have it, however, two very obvious solutions to the hosting problem presented themselves in the audience, on Tuesday.One was Ricky Gervais, who probably wouldn’t do it.The other, in about row , was Bradley Walsh, who stole the entire show by virtue of winning and saying nothing, but pulling all the right faces.Bradley would be the most obvious fit in the event’s history and I’m sure it would be warmly welcomed by most people,only the National Television Awards were worth saving.THREE and a half meandering years it took us to reach Friday night’s pm Brexit countdown.Yet in all that time I can’t remember one occasion when British TV’s satirical shows actually had something laugh-out-loud funny to say on the subject.That’s almost certainly because Have I Got News For You, The Last Leg, The Mash Report and Frankie Boyle’s New World Order all decided their left-of-centre anti-Brexit opinion was far more important than mere comedy.The wonderful irony is that the collective fury and bile has definitely had an effect.It’s made a minor star out of Geoff Norcott, one of those very rare comedians who’s not just a Conservative Leaver, he’s actually likeable as well.As the token voice of Brexit, Channel  and the BBC, very grudgingly, have had to include Geoff on almost every comedy show, including The Last Leg: Countdown To Brexit, where they’ve been trying and failing to screw a laugh out of Adam Hills’ beard for months now.I gave up on the latest attempt after about half an hour, which meant I was still looking for a show to make sense of Britain’s relationship with Europe and had only two reasonable options available, as the clock ticked down to pm.One was calm, sober analysis from the BBC, the other was ITV+’s screening of Love Island.Obviously, I took the more credible option and discovered men in lederhosen were flinging jugs of beer at scantily clad Frauleins while the commentator explained: “We sent a runner to buy strap-on harnesses and stuff poles on them.“The girls’ job is to toss pretzels at the boys and the couple with the least amount of pretzels on their pole at the end is out.”MAN Like Mobeen Man don’t like Mobeen.THE dressing-up box brigade lulled me into a  sense of security, at Sunday night’s Baftas, on BBC.True, host Graham Norton made sure there was an undercurrent of hostility to “white men” , from the start, and there was all the usual self-aggrandising flannel about “giving a voice to the voiceless”.But Andy “Gollum” Serkis made a two-minute -second speech, accepting his Outstanding Contribution award, that was so beautully judged it seemed to pacy them for nearly an hour and a half.Then Rebel Wilsonjoked that it was only sexism that stopped her joining Martin Scorsese and Sam Mendes in the Best Director category and it was like she’d flipped a switch on the entire room.Suddenly, Joaquin Phoenix was agonising about “systemic racism” and Prince William was lecturing everyone about “ersity” without the entire Royal Albert Hall gasping at his brass neck.Then, just when I thought it couldn’t get worse, up popped Hugh Grant to announce he was so impressed with the Best Film contenders His Lordship had actually condescended to vote for one of them, which I’m assuming lost.For a couple of seconds at least, though, it really was possible to think, “Maybe the National TV Awards weren’t so bad, after all.”WINTERWATCH, prediction of the week, Iolo Williams to Chris Packham: “In ten years’ time, we’ll probably have penduline tits.”Arthritic groins, Spacehopper-sized prostates and chronic flatulence.Further to last week’s allegations, Good Morning Britain weather girl Laura Tobin says: “I do not crave attention. I like to have attention for my work, good climate change stories and Nasa trips.”As I noticed myself, when I saw Laura appear in Tipping Point: Lucky Stars, Drive, with Vernon Kay, Pointless Celebrities and Sharknado : Global Swarming.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Weve got bottled water. The meals have completely changed, we are definitely no longer on a luxury cruise.We now get a plated meal, breakfast and lunch its been a toasted sandwich, rolls, a little desert, a couple of glasses of orange juice.Dont think Im sounding ungrateful, its just such a contrast to the first two weeks of a cruise.Its just like an extended two-week cruise, but its not going to be a luxy cruise, its going to be a floating prison.Speaking on Facebook, he wrote: It appears that our quarantine is on board the ship, that we will not be taken off to a hospital.The  people that are affected, they are being taken off very soon by the local coastguard into a medical facility. We are to remain on board the ship and we are confined to our cabins.He later posted an update on Facebook: It is .am and we have had no food or drink! This is becoming serious for me as an insulin dependent diabetic.Early this morning he posted a photo of his and his wes breakfast and captioned it: First meal in  hours. We have now anchored and on our second cruise in Japanese waters. It is going to be tough on rationed food, and with no alcohol!No services onboard the ship now. How the crew are going to cope with this beats me. This is a huge challenge for Diamond Princess.We are out at sea now converting sea water into drinking water. Ship was running low on water for showers etc.Photographs and video posted on Twitter by a passenger showed masked health workers clad in blue plastic gowns walking down empty corridors on the Diamond Princess.The trapped passenger also posted images showing views of deserted lounges and a barren deck.Carnival Japan, the local unit of the British-American cruise operator, said on Tuesday the turnaround of the ship had been delayed by about  hours.The company was not immediately available for comment on Wednesday.On Tuesday, the firm said that cruises scheduled to depart from Yokohama and the western port of Kobe this week would be cancelled because of delays related to virus checks.The new cases bring the total number of confirmed cases in Japan to . px,px, px\"

What is the future of the BBC  Should China build our telecoms network Seldom has the political news agenda been so packed. But what is the story gaining traction at Westminster  For the latest, let’s go straight to our correspondent outside  Downing Street - who, oh dear, is stomping away in protest like Dick Emery’s Honky Tonks, having just had a blazing row with Boris Johnson’s media strategist.Yes, the big story, crazily, is the stand-off between political journalists and the PM’s media advisers. The reporters, hardly the most delicate bunch of dahlias, are wailing that the Government is being beastly to them.In the blue corner we have Downing Street’s press officers who, in an unusual interpretation of the Trade Description Act, are refusing to speak to the Press. When newspapers write about themselves, readers are entitled to roll their eyes.Political news, like the mass-production of pork bangers, is a manufacturing process best conducted away from the view of consumers. Not unless you want to turn the whole country vegan.I’ve been in newspapers since the mid-s, much of the time at Westminster, and have met drunkards, liars, gropers, cheats — and that was just the religious-affairs writers. Don’t let’s pretend journalism or politics attracts innocent hayseeds. Which makes the over-reacting on both sides of the ide in recent days so ridiculous.Creative tension between reporters and politicians’ media handlers is a healthy thing, but the system has suddenly snapped. This follows a general election in which it sometimes felt as though the media, particularly broadcasters, niggled Boris Johnson more effectively than Jeremy Corbyn did.When Boris won a thumping majority, his aides may have thought: “Right, now we can exact revenge on our media tormentors.” If so, they are foolish and unprofessional.First, they started mucking about with the daily briefings to the Westminster press lobby, the club of accredited journalists who report on politics.Then, on Monday, they tried to bar some members of that lobby from a briefing by David Frost, Boris’s main adviser on the European trade negotiations. Some scribes were told they could attend, others were told they were barred.Downing Street claimed that the briefing was too specialised for general politics writers to appreciate. The reporters took a dferent view.They reckoned Downing Street strategist Dominic Cummings and his sidekick Lee Cain were trying to ide and rule, and to winnow out the journalistic troublemakers. In a rare moment of solidarity among hacks, the newshounds upped and left. Walkout!This squabble is now headline news. Urgent questions were raised in the Commons and many papers and broadcasters are protesting that the Government is trying to censor the free Press in a “sinister” way.They compare this tactic to Donald Trump’s denunciation of mainstream US media for spreading “fake news” . Sir Keir Starmer, would-be leader of the Labour Party, joined the outcry, siding with the journalists. We could have done without that slippery little bit of opportunism.The same Starmer boasted recently that he would refuse to talk to reporters from The Sun, presumably because this paper is not in his pocket.Attempts to neutralise awkward reporters are not exactly new. During the  election, as a scurvy political sketch writer, I was locked out of a Tony Blair campaign event in The Wrekin.Gordon Brown’s people stopped me attending a media event with the president of South Africa.Tory party cronies barred me from witnessing a leadership debate between David Cameron and David Davis in . In the last election, non-sympathetic journalists were not given access to Jeremy Corbyn’s battle bus. Mind you, we were lucky. As one Leftie reporter told me: “You couldn’t get on Corbyn’s bus but I couldn’t get OFF it!”Despite some of those historic precedents, the current “lobby war” is more problematic because it looks more concerted and because it comes at a time when traditional news sources are under challenge from the internet.Online news sites can be shady and unreliable. Traditional lobby journalists, for all their faults, are at least reasonably accountable.Both sides should cool it. The lobby should admit that its clique is unacceptably clubby for st-century politics. And Boris’s henchmen should drop the macho posturing. Why are they picking this fight at a time when the Government is so popular  Never a better time for it, they might say. They want to show who’s boss.You could compare their aggression to that of an inmate who on arrival in prison butts the first guy he meets in order to show other prisoners he’s a tough guy. In my experience, journalists respond badly to this approach.Look at the damage Tony Blair’s thuggish spokesman Alastair Campbell did to the government he served.It is not beyond the wit of ministers to palm favourable stories to selected journaliststhey so wish. But the central media unit at No should remember — as they have repeatedly told us — that they are “the people’s Government” and not merely the servants of Boris Johnson.Their juicy salaries come from the taxpayer and the taxpayer does not expect them to abuse their privileged position.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because very often it sure as hell ain’t the product.Last Saturday, the most read piece on the BBC news homepage was a clickbait “story” — taken from Twitter — about how Kim Kardashian eats chicken nuggets.Yes, you read that right. With £.billion of your money to its name, one of the most popular “stories” on the BBC’s news website was an item which didn’t cost a penny to make, wasn’t news and stretched the definition of “public service” far beyond breaking point. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.James Purnell — a particularly puffed-up BBC exec — announced  months ago that he and his Radio  Education team would be expanding into podcasts. He stayed horribly true to his word.In , Auntie produces podcasts on everything from football and Love Island to what Towie star Gemma ­Collins’ latest musings are, which — thanks to the big names at the helm — are ­raking in listeners.For Purnell, this is something to be celebrated. Successful podcasts presumably mean more money in his already overstuffed pockets.But for the hundreds of private podcast makers out there, it spells the beginning of the end. Competing with a company which uses public funds to net the likes of Peter Crouch is nigh-on impossible.How, I ask you, can a state broadcaster justy putting hard-working private firms out of business Yes, Ollie Williams discussing his shock exit from the Love Island villamight be entertaining, but what ­“service” is it providing the public Can the BBC — which doesn’t make Love Island — really do a better job of a Love Island podcast than ITV, which does You’d think the BBC top dogs, who are desperate to cling on to the Royal Charter, would be asking these vital questions too.But in their desperate quest for “yoof” audiences, they’ve chucked their critical faculties out of the window.And it’s all for nothing. Because the quest is a wild goose chase. According to the latest Ofcom report, most kids don’t watch ANY linear TV.So the BBC is defending a dying, analogue means of ­communication. But no one in the corporation can bear to face this unwelcome reality.So instead of cutting their own whopping salaries, they scrap well-known and well- respected current affairs ­programmes such as the ­Victoria Derbyshire show.Why  Because the more ­visible the cut, the easier it is for luvvies to pretend that the BBC is the blameless ­victim of evil Tory austerity.Nothing, of course, could be further from the truth. In fact,anything, it is the Tories and their tens of ­millions of voters who are ­victims of the BBC.The repeated Horrible Histories ­“comedy” — which mockingly undermined the existence of “British things” — and the ­ludicrously PC recent East-Enders storyline, in which a deranged killer embraces Islam and becomes a hero, are the latest in a long line of ultra- liberal BBC content seemingly designed to rub ordinary, ­patriotic Brits up the wrong way.Things can’t go on like this. If the state broadcaster is to survive, there must be an urgent and fundamental rethink.First, the BBC’s parasitical website must be shut down. The stories it features are mostly dross, or  adapted from newspaper reports.To list just one example, when Brits want to know what’s happening with Megxit, they can buy The Sun — which was responsible for the scoop in the first place.If the BBC wants a web presencethey can use it to broadcast News . Next, the salaries of fat cat managers and C-list celebs must be slashed.Then the corporation must think hard about its media offering. BBC and its often extremely niche arts offering should be folded into BBC.Radio  and , with content already well covered by ­commercial markets, must be shut down. As must every ­programme across BBC ­channels which is designed to damage ITV’s ­ratings.And of course Brits should not be punished for refusing to pay a licence fee for a service they may not use.Decriminalising it — as Boris Johnson is understood to be seriously ­considering — is the right thing to do.If Auntie can swallow a big slice of humble pie, accept her glory days are over and slim right down to size, she may have a future. If not, she’ll become a footnote to the history of British media.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Tracy Brabin bared a shoulder while voicing her concerns about press freedom after selected journalists, including those from the Mirror, were banned from a press briefing at Downing Street.The MP – who took over from murdered Jo Cox – said: “My Twitter feed was going mad. I was scrolling through the insults.“It was like some Victorian parlour game, you know, I’ve shown a bit of ankle. We used to call it slut-shaming. “I was a prostitute, a slag, a slut, really demeaning words.” The Shadow Culture Secretary, who took on her role last month, said it was crucial that female politicians challenge the abuse. She said: “It’s that sense that a powerful woman speaking about important things, obviously the only way you can shut her up is to talk about the way she looks. “It’s a way to diminish us. It’s a classic case of men feeling they have every right to comment on a woman’s attire.  If it was [my predecessor] Tom Watson, nobody would say a thing. Whatever I decide to wear, it’s not appropriate for you then to tell me what I should and shouldn’t wear.” She revealed picking out her clothes was hard at the moment as she lived in a tall house with a broken ankle. The £ ASOS dress she wore in the Commons has been flying off the shelves since the speech – and she says she received “phenomenal” cross-party support from her fellow MPs. Ms Brabin admitted she got used to the “blurring of that line” between public and private le when she worked as an actress on Coronation Street.

We cleared the property forensically, with coins being found in the most unlikely of locations. One sovereign was found amongst the loose sugar in the bowl on the kitchen table.

The coins formed part of the overall clearance of the dwelling, he said. We have no knowledge of the beneficiaries - however as far as we are aware no-one was present at the auction. Wotton Auction Rooms sold the collection of coins last week.

Hundreds of experts are set to meet in Geneva next week to set research and development priorities for coronavirus drugs, diagnostics and vaccines, the World Health Organizationsaid today. The scientist leading the UKaposs research into a jab has meanwhile announced a signicant breakthrough as experts race against time to develop a vaccine.Professor Robin Shattock, head of mucosal infection and immunity at Imperial College London, has told Sky News his team could be ready to test the vaccine on animals next week.If enough funding is secured, the vaccine could be tested on humans by summer, he added. Conventional approaches usually take at least two to three years before you even get to the clinic. And weaposve gone from that sequence to generating a candidate in the laboratory in  days. And we will have it in animal models by the beginning of next week. Weaposve short-tracked that part. The next phase will be to move that from early animal testing into the first human studies. And we think with adequate funding we could do that in a period of a few months. Prof Shattock thatthe vaccine can be successfully developed after summer it would be too late for the current outbreakit circulates around the world. He explained thatcoronavirus acts like influenza, we could see it wane over the summer months. However the vaccine could be used to combat a second wave of the coronavirus, the professor added. There is no proven effective therapies for coronavirus yet, the WHO says.  Prof Shattock is part of a crack team of international experts leading clinic investigations and research into the animal source of the virus which emerged at a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan last month. Global health authorities have been trying to control the outbreak spreading around the world, as China continues travel bans and lock-downs in an effort to contain the virus. Britain has pledged £ million to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations which works on health crises like pandemics and earmarked another £m for research and development in the UK.

Lisa Bloom, a lawyer acting on behalf of six women in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal and Radd Seiger, spokesman for the family of teenage motorcyclist Harry, has been held in New York today.The pair are calling for Mrs Sacoolas - who is alleged to have killed Harry while driving on the wrong side of the road - toto the UK and the Duke of York to face questioning from the FBI in the US over his links to Epstein. Mrs Sacoolas, a diplomataposs we, left the UK on diplomatic immunity while Andrew has not yet cooperated with the FBI, despite saying he would. Ms Bloom told reporters the parallels between the two cases are eerie and involved everyday teenagers who were victimised. Mr Seiger has reached out to Ms Bloom, saying there was a common thread in both cases. He said it was terrible advice for Mrs Sacoolas and the dukethey are being advised itaposs all going to go away and they should just wait it out. Asked by a reporterthe pair are proposing a swap, Mr Seiger said: It can never be a swap but at the heart of extradition treaties is reciprocity. If you want me as a nation to send people you want to prosecute, you have to agree to do the same thing. It can never be a straight swap but be careful what you wish for. If you want people from the UK like Prince Andrew, Julian Assange ... you have to think about making sure that treaty is followed to the letter. At the press conference in New York, Ms Bloom said: Today we stand with the family of Harry Dunn and they stand with us. Both Mrs Sacoolas and Prince Andrew must co-operate with law enforcement.  I call upon my government, the US, toMrs Sacoolas to the UK to face justice.   The lawyer said Andrew needs to answer questions about Jeffrey Epstein and his own behaviour, adding: In both countries everyone is equal in the eyes of the law.  Speaking of the reasons for reaching out to Ms Bloom, Mr Seiger said: Itaposs about evasion of justice.  These are the two greatest allies in the world and they follow a rules-based system. No-one, no matter who you are ... is above the law.  We all break the rules from time to time but we donapost get to walk away and hide.  He said after meeting Kiki, an alleged victim of Epstein also present at the press conference, what you see every day is a strengthening and stfening of resolve.  In a message to Andrew, Mr Seiger said: If you have nothing to hide get on a plane and meet with Kiki, and help her and help other victims ... thereaposs no other way. He said the US governmentaposs decision to refuse to extradite Mrs Sacoolas was legally indefensible and effectively ripping up the treaty. Mrs Sacoolas was charged with causing Harryaposs death by dangerous driving in December but US secretary of state Mike Pompeo rejected an extradition request for the -year-old last month.  The -year-old was killed when there was a collision outside US military base RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire on August  last year. Mrs Sacoolas ed to her home country and claimed diplomatic immunity, sparking an international controversy. Allegations about Andrew have also surfaced in recent weeks by Virginia Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein and alleges the duke slept with her on three separate occasions, including when she was . Andrew strenuously denies the allegations.In an interview with BBC Panorama, Ms Giuffre told how she was left horried and ashamed after an alleged sexual encounter with Andrew in London in . She claimed she danced with him in Tramp nightclub, adding he was the most hideous dancer Iaposve ever seen in my le and his sweat was ... raining basically everywhere.

Ronnie Russell, now , tackled gunman Ian Ball after he shot four people in the  London drama. The ex-boxer revealed police visited him before he was given a medal and said she would pay for his house “as a gt”. Ronnie told how the Queen got him out of a big financial hole by paying off his mortgage after his Princess Anne kidnap heroics. But,  years on, the former boxer has revealed he is again struggling to make ends meet and is reluctantly putting the George Medal he received for bravery up for auction to pay for his funeral. Breaking his silence for the first time since, Ronnie recalled the Queen’s ­kindness in helping him out after he bravely stepped in and saved Anne’s le – as the Palace insisted the cash would have come from private funds. Crazed gunman Ian Ball, then , had already shot the Princess’s chauffeur, minder, a policeman and a passing Mirror reporter as he tried to drag her from a car in Central London in . But in recent years the -year-old has suffered a string of serious health ­problems and run up a mountain of debt due to being unable to work. Ronnie said: “I’ve been very, very unwell, it’s rough. I have been realising I have to make provision for a funeral at some stage. I want to know that’s all done for and not leave that burden to someone . “It was something I said I would never, ever do. I am so proud and honoured to have done such a thing that I would never, ever sell it [the medal].” Ronnie recalled the moment he discovered the Queen was going to rescue him as he stood on the brink of losing his home in Strood, Kent, because he could not pay the mortgage. He was visited by police before he was due to receive his medal at ­Buckingham Palace. Ronnie added: “They were looking round my home and saying, ‘Oh this is a nice house.’ They askedI had a mortgage and I said yes, yes, why  “They said, ‘Well we are really telling you this a bit early but the Queen is going to pay off your mortgage as a gt for what you have done.’ “I thought that was wonderful. I was actually close to repossession at the time. They were going to repossess my home. So I dug myself out of that one.”  Ronnie, who lives in a rented Bristol council flat with partner Mandy and runs Swindon Speedway club, kept details of the Queen’s generosity to himself - until now. And a royal source said: “This would have been a deeply private matter and certainly no publicity would have been sought from the Palace or the Queen.” Another added: “Any such instance of generosity would have been made from the Queen’s private funds.” Dad-of-three Ronnie told of the dramatic day he helped save Princess Anne on March , , when he was , weighed st and was super fit. He came across the drama by chance after taking a shortcut down the Mall on his way to work with a cleaning firm. Ball had blocked Anne’s car and fired several shots through the rear window.  Armed with two revolvers, he shot her protection team and passing Mirrorman Brian McConnell.Ronnie said: “I wasn’t ­frightened. I had no idea who was in the car but I when I saw him shoot the copper I thought, that’s taking the p*ss, so I went for him.“I went to hit him around the back of the head and he turned and fired. It went through a taxi windscreen.” Ronnie, who has beaten cancer twice, had seven strokes and has arthritis, told how Ball tried to grab Anne, who was , while husband Mark Phillips pulled her away. He said: “There was banging and smashing going on. He had Princess Anne by the arm. There was a tug of war. “She was calm. She said: ‘Go away you silly man.’ I saw a door was open. I said: ‘Come this way, Anne, you will be safe. Ronnie then realised Ball was behind him with a loaded gun. He said: “At that point I thought it was now or never. I hit Ball very hard, square on the chin.“He was flat on the floor face down. I jumped on his back for good measure. I could have died, yeah, but I knew what I was doing. The only person I did not want to get shot was Princess Anne.” Ball was detained under the Mental Health Act and remains in Broadmoor high-security hospital to this day. Ronnie’s medal will be sold in London by Dix Noonan Webb next month. He said: “I just hope whoever buys it will invite me to lunch or something, where I could tell the story properly.” Mirror man shot tackling the gunman  Ronnie Russell was not the only hero that night, and Mirror reporter Brian McConnell was shot in the chest trying to save the Princess from kidnap. Brave McConnell, who was , saw the incident unfold while in a passing cab. He jumped out as the gunman threatened the Princess’s bodyguard. He stepped between the royal and the gunman and tried to reason with him. In a gripping first-person account from his hospital bed, McConnell told the Mirror about his experience.

The group bought a six-acre cattle field for a bargain £, before moving in lorry loads of hard-core during a Bank Holiday weekend. They were handed a High Court injunction, which they later received suspended prison sentences for breaching. But an appeal against the local councilaposs planning refusal has been successful - granting permission for  caravans and  mobile homes on the site in Little Hadlam, Hertfordshire. People living in the posh commuter village, where homes sell for up to £.million, include former England football star Matthew Upson. Hundreds of letters have been sent to the local council opposing the site -which locals estimate to be worth £milliomdeveloped. Gary Woods wrote: “Should this application be allowed it will do nothing other than promote a massive security risk to the homes and businesses in the area and slash millions off local properties in the area. “The people in this area have worked their whole lives to secure homes of this value and l do not see why we should be disadvantaged in this way to the tune of a whole le’s work.” Villager Carol Riley added: “The use of this land is agricultural and should remain as such. “The travellers’ site will have a massive impact on house prices. “The land was obtained deceitfully. The travellers have ignored the injunction. In late  the group of travellers bought land on the outskirts of Little Hadham, Herts., which had been used to graze cows for the previous  years. During the course of the Easter bank holiday weekend - when council workers were on holiday - they moved heavy building equipment onto the site. East Herts Council immediately applied for an injunction against the works, which was granted by the High Court. A planning application made by the travellers was later turned down, and they were ordered to leave. But an appeal against the decision, which went to a public enquiry, has now found in their favour. Explaining the ruling, a planning inspector said the site was a “sustainable location for a gypsy and traveller site in relation to accessibility to services and facilities”. The official added that the development would not unduly harm that character and appearance of the surrounding area”. A spokesman for EHC said: “We are extremely disappointed with the outcome. We will be taking further legal advice and looking at our options.”  There are understood to be as many as  travellers currently living at the site. The planning permission allows access roads and hardstandings to be built for  caravans and  mobile homes. One traveller called Tommy who lives on the site previously said: “When we get planning permission, we are going to tarmac the whole field. “We want to get water and electricity – we want to put up lights and gates. We don’t want to raise our children at the side of a road. Wherever we go, we get moved on. “We want our children to be registered with GPs and learn how to read and write in schools. We have pregnant women who will need to give birth soon in hospital. “It is better that we are here than in a school field or park.

Innocent people lost their lives because terrorists were released from jail even though they continued to pose a threat. Ministers are now in a race against time to get new laws through Parliament before another potentially dangerous jihadi is let out of prison. The Government is acting with the right intentions but we have learned from experience that rushed laws are not always the best laws. While we understand the need to act quickly, it is also important that the Government comes up with a response that will stand the test of time. It must have the support of the Muslim community and it needs to recognise that current de-radicalisation programmes are not working. Ministers should also explorethere are more effective measures than indeterminate prison sentences such as bringing back the control orders the Coalition government abolished in . This problem requires more than a knee-jerk response but a comprehensive plan that addresses the everything from the crisis in our prisons to more police on our streets to building trust in our communities. Kidsapos joy cut There are few greater gts you can give to a child than the joy of reading. Through books you can discover new worlds, spark an interest in a career and fire the imagination. For many young people the gateway to a le of reading is their local library.  But that door is being increasingly closed to children because of Conservatives cuts. Not only are there fewer libraries, they have fewer books on display. Figures unearthed by Labour show that more than  million books have been cut from libraries in England since the Tories came to power in . In that period we have also seen  libraries closed.

Each year a great number of people do just this and it results in some pretty interesting scenarios for staff at spas and hotels. As well as grand declarations of love and marriage proposals, hotel workers have also witnessed some pretty awkward scenes and been asked some downright bizarre questions by guests.With February  fast approaching, more than  hotel and spa managers who work with booking website SpaSeekers shared some of the strange and rather racy messages theyaposve received from customers ahead of their visits.Hereaposs a look at the most common ones... . Will I get aroused during a massage  For some men there might be nothing worse than getting an erection at an inappropriate time, but itaposs a very common problem. Whilst an erection can be an indicator of being physiologically aroused, it does not necessarily indicate the presence of emotional or sexual desire. Touch can activate the parasympathetic nervous system and therapists often run professional assessments to teach the body to separate the physiological response to touch from inappropriate sexual intentions. The customer service team at SpaSeekers have heard it all with mencalling for advice regarding becoming sexually aroused during spa treatments. Inquiries nearly always peak around Valentineaposs for this, with many booking in for a couples massage and fearing they will get a little too excited. . Is it safe to have sex in a hot tub or pool  According to SpaSeekers, the thought of steamy hot water and fast jet streams gets a lot of their customers excited - so much so that their phones and social media DMs have been filled with questions about whether they can have sex in them. While it may look like a romantic thing to do, itaposs neither advised nor allowed in most establishments. Plus having sex in hot water comes with added health risks such as rashes and yeast infections. Lovely.  . Room service with extra spice From oysters to asparagus, hotel staff are inundated with requests for all sorts of aphrodisiacs to be sent to rooms around Valentineaposs Day. Staff note that room service requests tend to peak during this time as guests are less likely to leave their room over the Valentineaposs period. One hotel manager adds that they recently had a guest enquire online as to whether they could have their room service brought to them by butlers in the buff.As well as all this, SpaSeekers staff say theyaposve been asked to leave some interesting items in bedrooms, including buckets of ice, whipped cream, melted chocolate and even hot wax. Letaposs not even think about the clean up. .

There is no suggestion that I personally falsied this email.“The suggestion is that I forwarded the email after it had been falsied by someone .“I refute the allegations made against me and I can confirm I will be appealing against my removal from my post.Mr Christie also said he felt that the penalty seemed to be “disproportionate” to the accusations made against him.“No other allegations have been made against me,” he said.“I have worked in my current role for  years and have had an association with the council for  years.“I continue to have a huge respect for my council colleagues, council officers and elected members.“This is a very unfortunate time for me and I will need to take time to look at things moving forward.“I don’t wish to say anything further at this stage but will be making my intentions clear in due course.”Blue Parrot had provided sound equipment for DSMT for previous shows.DSMT producer and manager Lina Waghorn said: “I am shocked and saddened that Kenny Christie is no longer working with the council.“He was a great asset to DSMT and an inspirational teacher.”It’s understood students at DSMT were informed on Sunday January  that Mr Christie was “moving on to new projects”.It was made clear to students he was not ing and that Kris Mordente, a St John’s Academy teacher, would be taking over director permanently.A source at DSMT said: “It’s just a bit strange that he’s gone. Kenny was DSMT and DSMT was Kenny. I don’t think anyone knows how we’re going to operate without him.“He had been growing distant for a while, we have only seen him three times since August and at one point Lina mentioned bringing in an assistant director.“It’s not something we’d expect, I think everyone here including Lina would be reluctant to let him go.”A Blue Parrot spokesman said the company was not awarded the DSMT contract because “strictly speaking, we did not meet the deadline.”A Dundee City Council spokesman said: “We do not comment on inidual personnel matters.”Kenny Christie has been described as one of the most “sought-after” musical theatre directors in the country.He has worked with DSMT for over  years, producing several musicals like Les Miserables and Annie.His directing career began at the age of , producing a one-act play as part of the SCDA drama festival.In , Mr Christie became the world record holder for the fastest theatrical production, taking one piece from book to stage in just . hours.He has also taught and organised dance workshops ,in Dundee and Perth, and has worked with Dundee City Council to organise dance activities for school pupils.Mr Christie has also held the title of chairman of the Heads of Instrumental Teaching Scotland, as well as being the first Youth Adviser for Scotland for the National Operatic and Dramatic Association.Kenny Christie’s sacking comes in the wake of a separate fraud scandal that has rocked Dundee City Council in the past year.In October, the council’s head of construction Mark Ross quit in the midst of an investigation into claims he was treated to a golfing trip on the Spanish coast by bosses of a firm awarded an £ million local authority contract.The £.m deal to provide heat and smoke and carbon monoxide detectors was awarded to Edmundson Electrical without going out to tender.The trip to Spain took place weeks after the contract was awarded and included Mr Ross, a senior Edmundson staff member, another council employee and representatives of two other firms.It was later revealed that the second council employee was Kenny Muir, who also worked in the council’s construction department.He was sacked from his role earlier this month.Mr Muir is the fourth senior employee to leave construction services since September, following the resignations of Mr Ross and electrical supervisor Iain Gardyne, who is accused of selling thousands of pounds’ worth of council smoke alarms online."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/02/5e3930203b5672.98108232-836x564.jpg ","title":"mcpake id like another striker but im happy to go with just two","story":"Dundee boss James McPake admits he’d like another striker in his squad but slim pickings in the free agent market means he’s happy to stick with just two for the rest of the campaign.An ultimately failed deal to bring in St Mirren frontman Danny Mullen went right to the wire on transfer deadline day.That was frustrating for the Dens boss but he’s more than happy with the quality of the two strikers he has at his disposal.Andrew Nelson ed to full training today after surgery to fix a broken hand while Kane Hemmings notched his seventh league goal of the season at Morton on Saturday .James said: “I would like another striker.

We know that the earlier a cancer is detected, the greater the chances of successful treatment and often cure.”Dr Perminder Phull, clinical lead for the bowel screening programme, said: “I would encourage everyone from the age of  to  to take part in the Bowel Screening Programme.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along.

A wee van and a motorbike were behind them at the time and they let them pass and they disappeared down the twisty road at an incrediblespeed.They reached Tighnabruaich at about  o#clock and saw Fulmar in the water, but when they stopped to speak to Johnny Malcolm and Donald Turner they were told she was not in the water more than # an hour and still not fully rigged. They were quite right but George Smith said they were busy getting Psyche ready for launchingbut they would be out first thing in the morning to bend on the sails and finish off the rigging.They got their storesin the yard and with these and their luggage went aboard in two trips. Things were soon put sufficiently enough in order to allow them to get to bed and after watching Psyche go down the slip they were soon in their bunks. It was a beautully clear evening but distinctly cold.Next morning they were up at sevenand about eight the yard men came out and finished up their jobs. Jimmy Smith fixed up the slipping clutch and suggested we do away with the present gear lever fancy arrangement which was not strong enough for its work. This the Skipper agreed to though it meant a less handy working but it did away with the pin and shield that broke up the dog-house seat, they being replaced by a removable hatch cover. It certainly made sitting in the dog-house more comfortable.The Skipper went ashore to the village for meat and some curtain hooks while Archie watered ship and the other two continued cleaning and clearing up aboard.At quarter to twelve they were away under full sail and in brilliant sunshine but with a cold north-westerly they ran to Ardlamont then beat up to Tarbert, being passed just outside Tarbert as an aeroplane flew close overhead, by Blink. They noticed a huge oil tanker doing trials just off Arran.They were anchored off the herring pier before  o#clock and they had supper-cum-lunch then went ashore. The Pilot to visit a friend, the others to get milk in the village then to walk to the end of the road on Loch Fyne. On their way they spoke to an enthusiastic English pair, working in their garden, who wanted to know off which yacht they had come.During the evening Arcturus and Tunnag came in and one or two motor boats. Zaidie was in when they arrived and Leonora was anchored across Loch Fyne in Buck Bay.All aboard, Margaret and Archie went off to the islet in the harbour to get some roots for their new garden then soon afterwards all turned in, for though it was a glorious looking evening it was perishingly cold and the stove, lit as soon as they anchored, had been very welcome.On Sunday they were again up early and found a dull overcast day. The Pilot, ashore for water, heard a poor weather forecastfrom a fishing board. On the strength of this they hurried breakfast and by  o’clock were away with a south-westerly breeze.The Skipper gave the first beacon a rap with the boom-end as they ran out of the harbour. The beat down to Ardlamontand thee ran the engine for five minutes to get out of a nasty lop. The sun came out for about five minutes but by the time they had reached the Carry Buoythe rain had started and it got heavier and heavier.The wind strengthened with the rain and they moved up very fast into Tighnabruaich Bay then up to Loch Riddon to anchor off the pier at Ormidale. As they passed Tighnabruaich they saw Torridon was on Fulmar’s mooring and they watched her crew panicking to get off before Fulmar arrived. They wondered what the Torridons said when they saw Fulmar pass on through and realised that they could have stayed where they were. As they passed Glen Caladh the new Jansi of Kames passed under a not very healthy-sounding engine.They had lunch and the stove was lit then Margaret and Archie went ashore to visit friends and when they came back they brought with them a big sack of coal . The late afternoon and evening were spent below talking and listening to the rain hammering on the deck.Monday morning it was dry but blowing hard. They got the anchor early and motored to the moorings. The sails were hoisted to dry them and St Roma came close by to make their number and at one time a big school of thrasher whales went through the Kyles heading east and at a great speed.About noon they went ashore for a visit to the hotel and for a run round the Ardlamont road . Back aboard they had lunch and soon after packed up and came home."},{"url":null,"title":"the cinema on wheels returns","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe screen machine will be rolling back into Mid Argyll at the end of the month.Bringing with it a host of movies for film fans the Screen Machine will be in Campbeltown Road car park in Tarbert from Wednesday January  to Thursday January  and Lochgilphead Resource Centre car park from Friday January  to Sunday February .Musical fantasy film Cats, based on the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical, features an ensemble cast including James Corden, Judi Dench, Jason Derulo, Idris Elba, Jenner Hudson, Ian McKellen, Taylor Swt, Rebel Wilson, and Francesca Hayward.Also known as Star Wars: Episode IX, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is an epic space-opera film.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

Douglas and Sons of Lilliesleaf, on Christmas Eve when Graham Douglas died .The Douglas family business was started at the end of the First World War by William Douglas, who had three sons Willie, Dan and Jimmy, who on leaving school in turn all joined the family business. Through time Willie and Jimmy both retired early from the firm through ill health and when Dan retired in  the business was taken over by Williersquos son, William , and long time colleague, Bill Reid . Graham became the fourth generation Williamto work in the business after leaving school and in  took over the business when his father, Bill, retired.The Douglas family took over the building of the annual Border Union Show and Kelso Ram Sales in  and the Championship Dog Show since the first Show in , completing  years for the former and  years for the latter respectively in .It is interesting to note they succeeded Messrs. Bulman, builders Kelso who had been involved with BUAS since . To have had only two main Contractors in over  years is indicative of their skills and loyalties.Graham was very clever at school with a good practical brain and I heard from his le long friend, Andy Shortreed, that he was an expert at, among other things, technical drawing and would make all manner of things out of wood and other material.He was encouraged to study and utilise these skills while at High School in Hawick but Graham was stubborn! All he wanted to do was leave school and join his father, Bill, and be a fencer, which he duly did in .Countless number of farms and estates throughout the Borders have benefited from Grahamrsquos skill, as have the three core events at BUAS. His younger brother, Neil, was in partnership with Graham for a number of years before ing to utilising his skills with heavy plant machinery.I cannot have more regard and respect for Bill and Graham and how they nurtured me when I joined BUAS as Secretary in . I listened and I learnt from them all the ins and outs of both the Showground and preparing these massive annual Events and bringing them together in such a professional manner and with an uncanny calmness that sometimes was frustrating but one knew that come the day the target was reached. The Ram Sales have evolved over the last  years with many changes and updates and it was a pleasure working with someone who was always conscious of the huge responsibility he had to the many thousands of people, whose livelihoods were often very dependant on a good Ram Sales or a good Show, whether buying, selling, exhibiting, a Trade Stand, providing a service or a member of the public.Grahamrsquos other passion in le was his racing pigeons, which he has bred and raced for over  years - and for the last  with his friend and near neighbour in Lilliesleaf, Bob Spearman. They had many years of great fun and indeed numerous successes with their birds and it was always a great pleasure and exciting for those at the Showground when in the spring Graham would very often bring a crate of young birds when he came to work and released them as part of their early training. A master breeder even he did not understand how the young birds knew which direction was home!He had a great eye and would spend many long evenings just watching the birds to learn which would be potential race winners and which to keep as breeding stock. They had their fair share of success in UK races, whether from Edinburgh or the south coast of England but their biggest success was when one of their favourites ndash Bonnie Lad ndash finished th out , birds released from the South of France. No-one does fathom how these incredible birds find their way home and I believe these two wise owls were also baffled but enjoyed the discussion and banter over a pint or two in the local pub. Thankfully Bob Spearman is carrying on with the ldquoLilliesleaf Legends pigeon flock.Grahamrsquos greatest assets were that he was honest, thorough and reliable with great attention to detail in anything and all in which he was involved.

and embarked on a year-long campaign to eradicate dog fouling.Now, thanks to a successful bid for funding, new bins and bag dispensers have been located throughout the town.ldquoIrsquove always found the notion of dog poo smeared across our streets abhorrent, even as a small child, said community councillor Jackie Couchman.ldquoInnerleithen has a high density of dogs in a relatively small area which magnies the issue.ldquoMost dog owners are responsible and pick up, a sizeable minority do not and, it would seem, will not. I thought it was worth a concerted effort to seewe could make a dference to the state of our streets to benefit everyone. I was prepared to make a personal commitment of time and effort to this cause.The project got off ground last January when Innerleithen community councillors made the decision to try and rid the streets of dog mess.Reflecting on the actions they undertook, Jackie said: ldquoI became involved after Gordon Daly taped plastic bottles to lampposts to dispense free poo bags to those in need.\"Susan Meikle and I offered to help these from supplies Gordon had procured from the Dogs Trust.The following month, the community council was encouraged by local authority councillors to apply for funding through the Localities Area Bid Fund.ldquoThis concentrated my mind and I took it upon myself to complete the application with offers of help from both a previous applicant and The Bridge, said Jackie.ldquoWe heard our project had been shortlisted to be put to the public vote in time for our May community council meeting.But the timetable for the public voting process was disrupted by other political happenings, and after a tense wait and a flurry of activity to encourage voting, good news was delivered.Jackie added: ldquoWe heard our bid was successful in time for our July meeting.\"Various conditions had to be met before the funds could be released, including  percent of the amount applied for supplied by us, copies of our constitution and accounts.ldquoHaving won the funding, final details of ordering, delivery, installation and maintenance had to be agreed.Whilst waiting on the new bins to arrive, the community councillors did not rest on their laurels.With the help of SBC leader Shona Haslam, Jackie and Gordon stencilled anti-fouling signs on problem pavements in Innerleithen.Community councillors also mapped out locations for the new bins and Scottish Borders Council agreed to install these and remove or relocate the redundant ones.ldquoOperationally, the local authority agreed to provide the litter bags and to replenish the poo bags with us taking responsibility for funding them, added Jackie.With the bins now in place, the community council is due to meet on Monday to discuss further fundraising initiatives.The townrsquos community council, in particular, the poo-busting trio of Jackie, Gordon and Susan, have worked tirelessly this last year to combat the dog fouling issue in Innerleithen.Nevertheless, inevitable questions remain.Will they no longer witness the flattened deposit bearing the imprint of a shoe, the stressed parent quickly steering their child away from the offending brown mess, or irritated adult repeatedly scraping their foot off a kerb Probably not says Jackie, adding: ldquoWas it worth it  Yes.\"And in the shorter term it has made a dference.\"Longer term, my feeling is that it will depend on continuing effort and collective ownership of the problem. People have generally been very supportive although every post on social media has triggered lsquothey wonrsquot ever pick up commentsrsquo.\"Despite the campaign Jackie says itrsquos unlikely that everyone will become law abiding citizens and pick up after their dog, but says shersquod do it all again in an effort to keep clean the streets and grass verges of the bonnie town she resides in."},{"url":null,"title":"council-asked-declare-interest-planet","story":"CAMPAIGNERS descended on Thursdays meeting of Scottish Borders Council in a bid to convince the local authority to declare a Climate Emergency.So far  councils across Scotland have made the declaration as efforts continue to halt and reverse the damage being done to the planet.Despite the Extinction Rebellion protest outside the council headquarters at Newtown St Boswells, bosses have yet to issue any statement.Protestor Jennie Gibson said: \"The declaration is the first step to deal with the problem.\"It shows the council takes climate crisis seriously and so should we.\"It means they have to make plans to cut emissions and we can seethey do it or not.

attempted to defend their track record despite being rated amongst the worst performing in Scotland.Figures released by the Local Government Benchmarking Framework last week puts the Newtown St Boswells authority towards the bottom of the heap in most categories.With housing stock transferred over to Scottish Borders Housing Association and all cultural and leisure facilities in the hands of Live Borders, the local authoritys portfolio of responsibility has diminished over the past decade or so.But much of what remains under Scottish Borders Council control is lagging behind other authorities.As well as having the second worst roads in the country, according to the   findings, bosses at Newtown spent less than half the national average on repairs, pound, per kilometre against the Scotland-wide pound,.Although an argument can be made regarding the additional amount of carriageway in the rural Borders, similar authorities, such as Highland, Aberdeenshire, Moray and both North and East Ayrshire, all spent considerably more.Only Dumfries and Galloway, and Eilean Siar authorities spent less during  .Scottish Borders Council also spent below the national average on every aspect of education.Across Scotland the average spend per pupil in secondary education was pound,, while in the Borders it was only pound,.Primary pupil spend in Scotland was pound,, while in the Borders during   it was pound,.And pre-school spend per pupil in the Borders was only pound, against a national average of pound,.The number of sick days taken by teachers in the Borders was also worse than the national average.While spending on frontline education is well below Scottish averages, the amount spent on office-based administration and support across the whole authority during  , at seven percent of budget, was almost double the national level of four percent.Local MSP Christine Grahame believes Scottish Borders Council should re-prioritise its spending.She told us: \"I am sure Borderers will be angry at the information coming to light from this given how clearly it demonstrates the councilrsquos deeply skewed priorities for its spending.ldquoTime and time again constituents have contacted me to complain about the frankly dangerous state of some roads in the Borders and I have repeatedly raised it with SBC.\"To now find out it has the third lowest spend per kilometre on roads in the country, and that the area has the second worst A roads and B roads is an unsuprising but damning indictment of the councilrsquos priorities.ldquoWhy is this Tory-led administration spending poundm on vanity projects like the purchase of the Lowood Estate for speculative development, whilst it underspends on our schools, tourism and helping people back to work  Why does it spends so little on economic development to bring down the  percent of shops that lie empty in our town centres ldquoThere are serious questions for SBC to answer here and I for one will certainly look to see them held to account.Investment in helping people back to work was the second lowest, at . percent, of all the  authorities in Scotland.Scottish Borders Council also spent less than half the national average when it came to economic development and tourism.Across Scotland authorities averaged pound, per , population on attracting tourists and improving the local economy, in the Borders the spend was just pound,.And the figures also show that there was a higher proportion of empty town centre propertiesin the Borders than the Scottish average .Elderly care was also ranked poorly with only  percent of council services rated as good or above - the fourth worst in all Scotland - compared to a national average of  percent.Ron Sutherland, who had a successful career in corporate governance, finance and management, has been a strong critic of spending at Newtown St Boswells in recent years.The retired consultant from Innerleithen told us: \"As those who have attempted in recent times to get to the heart of topical issues, transactions and dealings will already be aware, it is often dficult to ascertain what goes on at SBC, through the barrier of smoke and mirrors around the councils Newtown St Boswells nerve centre.\"It might be thought that senior officials - of which we evidently have many - and elected members prefer to inhabit those parts of Council HQ located away from the spotlight of public scrutiny and accountability!\"However, the Local Government Benchmarking Framework provides an excellent opportunity for outsiders to gain an insight into our local authoritys performance in comparison with other councils across the country, and indeed against those with similar characteristics to SBC.\"Revelations of shortcomings in expenditure, or investment of council taxpayers money last year in several key local authority areas of responsibility such as roads, schools and education, tourism, economic and social development, etc. are unsurprising.\"There are fewany bright spots - especially worrying when SBC allocates almost twice the national average funding to administration support, doing little to dispel impressions of a top-heavy, inefficient organisation.\"This resonates with the recent eye-wateringly costly and confused SB Cares debacle - indicative of poor planning and organisational management allied to woefully inept financial control and monitoring by those senior people charged with doing just that, and paid handsomely into the bargain.For the record in the year to March , its last full year of operation, provisional accounts for SB Cares LLP disclosed a net loss of over pound. million, with net current liabilities - effectively, accumulated insolvency - in excess of pound. million - plus an audit report casting material uncertainty and signicant doubt on the organisations viability as a going concern.,params: .push\"In most peoples book, that would read like mismanagement, which would be little short of a scandal.\"Moreover, in the four years of so of employment, the CEO of SB Cares took home more than half a million pounds for his efforts and he was also employed as an executive director of SBC, in clear contravention of relevant guidelines relating to conflict of interest.\"Will anyone be held accountable \"In a statement from Scottish Borders Council, bosses attempted to highlight the amount of money spent with local suppliers and contractors was signicantly higher than the national average.But it didnt mention that only  percent of invoices were paid on time - against a national average of  percent, making it the fth worst for paying bills in the country.Rather than being disappointed SBC Chief Executive Tracey Logan prefers to look at more locally sourced surveys.She said: ldquoThese statistics are just one element of how we regularly monitor and report the performance of the council.\"Many of these figures are not new, and in some areas we believe that some of the local data we collect, for example the Scottish Borders Household Survey and those undertaken with Live Borders customers, are more representative due to the volume of responses received.\"These show much higher levels of satisfaction with services.ldquoHowever, every piece of information on our service delivery is useful, and we will use the statistics and comparison data to look at how we can continue to change, improve and invest to provide the best possible services to the residents of the Scottish Borders.Scottish Borders Council did fare well in council tax collections and support offered for looked-after children.And it has the second highest spend of any authority, at pound, per , population, on parks and outdoor spaces, with the national average being pound,.The signicant spend is down to the investment in new parks and the additional cost of staff from other departments.Council leader Shona Haslam said: \"It is abundantly clear when you look at the full range of data released that council services are under pressure across the country, with average performance falling across many areas.ldquoIn some measures this follows long periods of improvement, suggesting that we may be reaching a tipping point in how council services are being affected by the need for us all to make savings due to the gap between the funding required to maintain and improve services and that actually available.ldquoScottish Borders Council continues to make and maintain progress in some key areas, but we have to be realistic and acknowledge that services, particularly non-statutory ones, are impacted by reductions in spending.\""},{"url":null,"title":"borders-holiday-inspires-authors-debut-novel","story":"A NEW author has set his debut novel

I use this phrase to describe the spectacle of street lights at night when viewed from a vantage point.One of the best places in East Lothian to view the lsquoupside down skyrsquo is from the road by Farsquoside Castle. This vantage point gives you views over Wallyford, Musselburgh, Portobello and Edinburgh beyond.These urban areas create a sea of lights which look like a sky full of bright stars, except, of course, itrsquos lsquoupside downrsquo and theyrsquore not really stars. But it looks spectacular in its own way. In fact, views with bright city lights are these days often considered tourist attractions.But Irsquove recently realised something: while the lsquostarsrsquo of the lsquoupside down skyrsquo are getting more numerous and extensive every year, the real stars in the actual sky are becoming more dficult to see at least where I live.Literally thousands upon thousands of houses are being built in the western part of our county. Much of the rural landscape in this part of East Lothian, which I knew when I was a child, is going fast.Most of me understands and accepts the needs for this, but a part feels sad at the loss of a recognisable landscape. And already I have noticed that a by-product of this has been increased light pollution in areas close to where I live. It is going to get much more noticeable as more development takes place.I know many people will say there are many more things to think about, especially in late January, when the Christmas turkey is coming home to roost and all those bills have to be paid at a time when we are already financially drained from festive expenditure, and stressed out. Thank goodness for Burns suppers, a highlight of a month that often seems both the darkest and longest of the year.But this is all the more reason to pause. When was the last time you really had the opportunity to sit under a dark night sky full of visible stars  This is one of naturersquos free gts and stargazing has real benefits for our mental health and emotional wellbeing.I remember some years ago, when visiting a friend in a very rural part of Scotland, I went out to put something in the bin. My friend came out to seeI was OK, as I hadnrsquot ed after  minutes. I had been struck by the beauty and power of the starlit sky, unpolluted by city lights. Without noticing the time, I had sat just gazing at the universe above me.I can remember the sense of awe and peace it created. Sure, part of it was also the quiet and stillness in that area, but sitting under the canopy of stars is what overwhelmed me in that moment.Itrsquos an experience fewer of us can enjoy because of the increase in light pollution, but also noise and general busyness all around us. So we often donrsquot even realise what wersquore missing. Perhaps there is a cause and effect here: the less you notice the absence of something, the less you think itrsquos important or relevant.Our ancient ancestors understood its power. But I think we have lost the sense. I recently asked a group of young people how many of them had sat under the stars and just gazed and wondered at them. Sadly, none had done so, and some thought the idea ldquoweird. I think a lot of adults would share that opinion.But taking time to sit and really wonder at an unpolluted night sky can fill us with awe, as I experienced that evening at my friendrsquos house. It makes us feel small and in so doing it puts our worries and anxieties in perspective. It can promote inner peace and calm.For sure, the bills wonrsquot go away neither will the stress at work or whatever is dominating your thoughts most of the day. But in taking time to pause and wonder at the vast and almost timeless beauty of the stars, your soul gets time to catch up. It can help you see things dferently, in a more creative way. Itrsquos a form of meditation with something bigger than we can imagine, but also something incredibly beautul.And itrsquos fascinating, as you try to identy the dferent constellations, and perhaps realise how much you donrsquot know or have forgotten. Could you identy the northern star, and what constellations can you see  Sailors in days of old were experts at identying the stars to aid direction, but Irsquom sure they also marvelled at the unhindered beauty and mystery of them as well.There are still many places in our county where we can be wrapped in star-lit darkness. But as the lsquoupside down skyrsquo gets bigger and brighter, the real stars are fading in so many places.The real shame is, as the stars disappear from our sight, they may disappear from our consciousness as well.Letrsquos not let that happen. Let us gt our children, and ourselves, with the noticing and gazing at the real stars in our sky and somehow find the time, even briefly, to stargaze."},{"url":null,"title":"garry-oconnor-referees-haddington-amateur-teams-successful-charity-match","story":"Haddington Town FC took time out over the festive period for a special friendly in aid of Back Onside.Former Hibernian and Scotland striker Garry OrsquoConnor, who is an ambassador of the good cause, refereed the match, which saw members of the amateur teamrsquos squad come up against one another on January .Matt OrsquoConnell, chairman of the club, which was formed last year, said they were determined to help support the charity, which helps young people and adults who face mental health challenges.He said: ldquoWersquore a club that was founded on the idea of bringing local guys together into a positive social and active environment.ldquoItrsquos well documented that the highest proportion of suicide across Scotland is men aged - and thatrsquos something we hope to positively redress in our town by facilitating a great environment in which local guys can improve not only their physical but also their mental health.ldquoOur connection with the charity Back Onside was really born of their slogan, #SupportThroughSport, a powerful statement that really resonated with us.ldquoTheyrsquore a great charity who are doing a hell of a lot across the UK and so for us, a small amateur club barely nine months old, to play a small part in helping a charity who share our ethos was immensely rewarding.Haddington Town play on Sunday mornings in Division Two of the Lothian and Edinburgh Amateur Football Association , alongside fellow county side Meadowmill.The charity match, played at Knox Academy, finished - in favour of the lsquoawayrsquo Haddington Town team.Libby Emmerson, founder and CEO of Back Onside, said: ldquoWe are beyond grateful for the support received from Haddington Town Amateur Football Club and guest referee Garry OrsquoConnor.ldquoAs a small charity with a huge clientele, community events such as the Haddington Town AFC charity match are key to raising funds and awareness so that we can continue to support those facing mental health challenges.Mr OrsquoConnell thanked everyone for their support, with the match raising pound, ndash more than double the target.He said: ldquoHuge thanks to Libby Emmerson, FES FM and Garry OrsquoConnor.

Youve worked your way up to a wealthy, privileged place where your voice, which people actually want to listen to, is amplied to millions of folk at once.Problems arise when it turns out that you are, in fact, a rank hypocrite.Take, for one example, Prince William, who warned of the \"catastrophic effect\" of overpopulation on the planet... while his we was expecting their third child. Perhaps keep your mouth zipped on that topicyoure not keeping your trousers zipped.His Royal Highness was back on it at the Baftas on Sunday night, this time giving a speech about how the industry must try harder in terms of racial ersity.Im not sure I remember him putting his name to his brothers statement about the racist treatment of his own sister-in-law or prioritising erse representation in his household staff. London is one of the most multi-cultural cities on earth - not hard to find employees from a iety of backgrounds, one would imagine.Where Willian, and so many celebrities, lets himself down is to make a point about an issue without addressing how he is complicit in the problem and should be addressing it. Otherwise, you look sanctimonious and a bit silly.Stepping in to show him how it should be done was Joaquin Phoenix, making an acceptance speech for Best Actor against a backdrop of an all-white acting nominees shortlist.There had been talk, when the shortlist was announced last month, of a boycott but, rather, everyone whos anyone turned out on the night.Phoenix, addressing the whiteness of the awards ceremony, made his interest in the issue credible. \"Irsquom ashamed to say that Irsquom part of the problem,\" he said, \"Because Irsquove not ensured that the sets Irsquove worked on are inclusive.\"He added: \"We have to do the hard work to truly understand systemic racism. It is the obligation of the people who have created and benefit from the system of oppression to be the ones to dismantle it.\"So thatrsquos on us.\"The \"us\" was followed with a slightly too long pause. It makes people uncomfortable to hear they might be complicit in an injustice they would be quick to condemn. Action, though, is the real test of mettle and lets see what action Phoenix now takes to address this issue.The actor Laurence Fox would, as a surprise to everyone following his appallingly crass Question Time appearance, seem to be role modelling decent behaviour in the wake of racism.Fox took it upon himself to argue with an academic in the BBC audience about racism. When his own white privilege was called out he labelled this racist and he referred to discussions of race in modern Britain as \"boring\". What a luxury, to be able to be bored about a subject that profoundly effects the lives of your neighbours, eh He went on to make some bizarre remarks about  trying too hard to be ethnically erse and ending up historically inaccurate. The only one who was inaccurate, in the end, was Laurence Fox, but he bullishly kept on.Until last week when he was pictured with the writer and critic Bonnie Greer, who Fox seems to have contacted after hearing her criticise him on a radio show.Greer was lambasted for the meeting and told that she shouldnt have accommodated him. It seems that speaking directly to your critics, face to face and not online, in an attempt to learn and understand is a step a great many people could learn from.While Foxs views were repulsive, his most recent actions are right. Now he has had Greers generous counsel, Im sure hes far less bored.Learning opportunities, happily, abound. The new Speaker of the House of Commons has laid down a role model gauntlet we must hope other men will pick up.When asked as to what he thinks about breastfeeding in the House, Lindsay Hoyle said he would allow it. A -year ban, imposed by Baroness Boothroyd, has surely hampered new mothers from taking their place, should they want to, on the green benches.The decision is right, but Sir Lindsays rationale is righter still. \"I think it would be wrong for me as a male to dictate on that policy,\" he said. Absolutely.Taking responsibility, self-reflection and centring the people effected by policy - some good news for once. Phoenix, Sir Lindsay and Fox show how it should be done. Now for others to follow their lead."},{"url":null,"title":"TV REVIEW   The shocking realities of life on Universal Credit","story":"ARRIVING with the usual claims of ldquounprecedented access, the BBCrsquos look at the introduction of Universal Credit seemed to cover the familiar terrain of desperate claimants up against a shambolic system.

This was I, Daniel Blake: The Reality, and what bleak viewing it made.Universal Credit, the combining of six benefits into one, was meant to simply the system and get people into work. Due to be introduced by , the latest estimated completion date is . At Peckham Jobcentre in London, where a  people a day come through the doors, we met Rachel, a single mother of two. She had worked in the NHS for  years before quitting to care for her mother. Now trying to get back on benefits, she had entered the Universal Credit labyrinth, chief horror of which was waiting five weeks till the first payment. It used to be longer.Phil, , had been unemployed for ten years. His benefits had been cut or stopped, ldquosanctioned in the jargon, three times because he had been deemed not to be looking hard enough for work. Even his very patient adviser called him a ldquopain in the butt.Eventually, Phil took a job, cleaning trains. Though he felt better physically, he was only marginally better off and could not see much of a future for himself. It looked like an odd sort of victory.The film went back and forth from Peckham to the DWP offices in Whitehall, where Amber Ruddwas the latest Secretary of State to come through the revolving doors. It was her idea to let the cameras in, hoping to improve the departments image.With meeting rooms named Carrie Fisher, Prince, and George Michael , the DWP oozed WA The Thick of It. We saw Rudd shooting the breeze with a Newsnight reporter before the camera was switched on. ldquoOoh it was good, she said of Bodyguard, the hit drama about a Home Secretary and her handsome Scots minder.Elsewhere in the department a noticeboard was full of tatty bits of paper setting out aims such as ldquoPay claimants the right amount of money and on time.Back at the Jobcentre, Declan had spent the last three nights sleeping in a park. His next payment was not due for weeks.ldquoNot been a good day, summed up a voice behind the camera.ldquoTo think Irsquod find myself at  years of age on the streets, Declan replied. He began to cry.ldquoSorry, said the voice.It was excruciating to watch worse to live through.Again, the staff, or ldquojob coaches did what they could. The ones who featured were warm and sympathetic. Whether that was always the case was hard to say, since opposite types would hardly agree to be filmed.Each adviser had  claimants each to look after, sorting out everything from childcare to housing. Finding work was just one part of the job. As was dealing with irate clients.ldquoI have to remind myself that the anger might be directed at me but it is not about me. Itrsquos about a system, said Karen. We saw her end an eight hour sht in the Jobcentre and go on to a second job stacking shelves.

Unless that changes, Orkney will be left with the oldest fleet and the highest fares in the country — and that can only be described as blatant discrimination.”In a response to Councillor Stockan, the minister for energy, connectivity and the islands, Paul Wheelhouse, says Orkney Islands Council is “wholly responsible for the inter-island ferry services which they provide.”He says minsters understand the “signicant financial challenges that can fall on inidual local authorities with responsibility for ferries” and that the Government has “made clear our commitment to Orkney’s internal ferry services” with additional funding of £. million in total over the past two years.Councillor Stockan said: “I am extremely disappointed that the First Minister has chosen not to respond to our considerable concerns directly, or to meet with me to discuss an issue of fundamental importance to our community.“I can only describe the Government’s current position as irrefutable discrimination against the people of Orkney. The additional funding we received over the last two years was welcome, but fell far short of what is needed to fully fund our internal ferry service.“I call on the Government to address this when the budget is published this week — and I have asked the other parties at Holyrood to offer us their full support in securing full and fair funding for Orkney.“The running and replacement costs of Western Isles ferries are fully subsidised by the Government. It is only right and proper that we in Orkney should be treated in the same way.”In the letter, Councillor Stockan also criticises the Government for its continued failure to introduce Road Equivalent Tarf on routes linking Orkney to the Scottish Mainland.“The roll-out of RET began on West of Scotland ferry routes more than a decade ago, reducing fares for local people and visitors alike,” he added.“It is our firm belief that there is no impediment preventing RET being introduced on Orkney routes, and that any further delay is unfair and will result in signicant prejudice against local ferry users.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Trivandrum may now officially be Thiruvanathapuram but older names sometimes stick. A few months ago I was in Mumbai, and noticed how many people there still call the city Bombay – a rather more beautul name, in spite of the soft syllables of Mumbai. Mumbai sounds like mother Bombay is evocative of style and glamour, and all the ebullience for which that city of  million people is renowned. And then there is Bollywood, a perfect name, that would lose all its appeal were it to become Mollywood.Yesterday in TrivandrumI had two contrasting conversations. India is a country that loves conversations we, by contrast, are tight-lipped in the public space, and apt to view conversational forays with indference, sometimes even with suspicion. : Some more proof we really are all Jock Tamson’s bairns – leader comment: Why ‘sedition’ has no place in a mature democracy – leader comment‘Everybody hates the British’In India one engages, and at the literary festival I have been attending, there has been a dizzying amount of engagement. The first conversation was unusual, though, as it was an exception to the courtesy with which India treats visitors. The conversation, which took place over lunch with two women who were readers of my books, one of them a public intellectual here in India, started well enough, but was suddenly marred by the younger of the two announcing, “Everybody hates the British, you know.” She then added, for good measure, “The English are really dreadful people.”This was over a plate of fish curry. Silence. She stared at me. A possible response might have been to point out that England and Scotland are dferent countries, but then her first comment had been about the British, a rather broader description. However one interpreted it, though, it was a breach of comity. You do not address a stranger in that way, and no entire people can be described as really dreadful, eventheir ancestors did some dreadful things.The conversation moved to historical apology, a familiar enough theme, with well-rehearsed arguments on the role of apology in committing the wrongs of the past to history. The Amritsar Massacre is still a sore topic here, and its centenary has revived the sense of hurt it engendered. This, I thought, was an echo of that hurt.Long shadowsThe second conversation was a complete contrast. That took place under a tree, with a retired lecturer in English language from a local college, a man who embodied all the charm and moral seriousness that one encounters in so many in this country. Le in India has a serious edge to it that is sometimes obscured in the affluent West: people here have often had to struggle for their education they have to battle against a harsh climate, want, corruption, and the sheer weight of a massive population. How does one get ahead in leone is rubbing shoulders with over a billion people Matters of the mind are very pressing here. We talked about the state of India today, about the long shadows of caste and, more broadly, the burdens of history. There are Scotsmen everywhere in Indian history, he said to me. “Look around this place – that observatory down there, for example – that was a Scotsman who set it up. And all the engineers on the railways and the teachers and the missionaries in this place – Kerala has a large Christian population – so many of those were Scotsmen. And you know something  They believed in education, when our local potentates only wanted their people educated.” They, at least, were not really dreadful.There is, of course, real and understandable resentment over the depredations of the British Raj, and indeed over company rule. William Dalrymple’s The Anarchy is much talked about in India at present: he shows theand depth and breadth of the exploitation of India by a relatively small number of British aries. But it is not just British colonialism that comes into contemporary Indian political debate – there is a far more signicant instance of history being used for contemporary political purposes in this country.Europe’s identity politicsThis occurs in the contemporary argument in India over identity politics. Here the time-scale is much longer, and stretches back thousands of years to the origins of contemporary Indian civilization. Is Indian civilization indigenous to India, or did it originate by way of Steppe migration  You might think this was ancient history – and it sounds rather like it – but it lies at the heart of the current political le of this country. Identity is tied up with citizenship, and the rights that citizenship confers. Is India a monocultural country or is it a pluralistic country composed of a patchwork of faiths and secular identities In Mumbai I had lunch with an old friend, an Indian writer, who was on the verge of tears as he spoke of these arguments. It is a very isive issue, but then identity politics is a very isive issue wherever it raises its head. It is their internal problem, of course, but we are peripherally caught up in India’s identity issues because Scots were part of the Raj, no matter how much we may pretend that it was an English enterprise. Remember all the railway engineers and administrators, all the district commissioners and so on in Africa.And of course we have our own identity issues. They are simmering away in the background, and come to the fore whenever there is a debate about Gaelic road signs and Gaelic-speaking police cars. And then there is the small matter of European identity.A sense of local identity is important, and gives meaning and texture to le, but it can be a potent agent of conflict. Perhaps we would all benefitthe emphasis were to sht from subsidiary identities, and to focus on the identity that really matters: our shared humanity, our planetary identity, so to speak. An important aspect of our identity is that we are late Homo sapiens. The other ieties of Homo, we might remind ourselves, are no longer here.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"uk government must never be allowed to blacklist journalists it doesn t like leader comment","story":"The UK Government#s decision to bar selected media organisations from a Brexit briefing by civil servants is an alarming step towards #populist# attacks on the free press.If there’s one thing that unites the dictators, tyrannical monarchs and undemocratically ‘elected’ presidents of this world, it is a passionate hatred of the free press.In a country where an inidual has illegitimately assumed absolute control, they become like the sacred king in Scottish anthropologist James George Frazer’s book The Golden Bough, constantly living in fear of being murdered by their successor. Having strived for power, they now find themselves trapped by it, almost forced to lash out, sometimes with deadly force, at those who dare ridicule them or point out flaws.Over the last few years, an alarming trend has been gathering force in the democracies of the world, in which so-called ‘populist’ leaders have started to attack the press in ious dferent ways.: Journalists walk out after Number  bars outlets from Brexit briefing: White House bans BBC and critical press from key briefingIn Vladimir Putin’s Russia, “murders and physical attacks against journalists continue to go unpunished”, according to Reporters Without Borders. And Draconian laws have been used by the state to put pressure on the press to the extent that “leading independent news outlets have either been brought under control or throttled out of existence”, it adds in the  World Press Freedom Index entry for th-placed Russia.‘Enemy of the People’However, some populists have adopted slightly subtler tactics. Donald Trump, for example, regularly lambasts the “mainstream media” or what he sometimes calls the “fake news media” and “the Enemy of the People”, a phrase long associated with dictators like Stalin. Membership of this group appears to include most of the biggest names in American journalism: the Washington Post, the New York Times, NBC News, ABC, CBS and CNN. It is a tactic designed to cast doubt on anything they report and bolster news organisations that explicitly support Trump.In this respect, Boris Johnson is not remotely like Putin or even Trump. However, the decision to bar journalists working for selected news outlets from a briefing on his Government’s Brexit strategy given by civil servants, who are supposed to be politically neutral, is an alarming sign of a step towards this populist strategy. The Scotsman and other Scottish media were also not informed about the briefing.Such actions by politicians are not unprecedented. In , reporters from the , Daily Mail andsaid they were barred from then First Minister Alex Salmond’s first press conference after the independence referendum, although this was perhaps less serious as it was held to announce his resignation.All-for-one solidarityBut for anyone who thinks such actions are not particularly worrying, the UK Government’s ban on some members of the press resulted in a boycott of the briefing by leading political correspondents, including the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, ITV’s Robert Peston and reporters from the , the Daily Mail, the Sun, the Financial Times and the .This rare display of all-for-one solidarity across the press’s political spectrum was designed to send a message to the UK Government that it must heed – the British mainstream media will not collude in this populist tactic.Politicians can obviously give interviews to inidual journalists they think will give them more favourable coverage or, just as Johnson avoided the BBC’s Andrew Neil ahead of the general election, they can avoid journalists they fear.But they absolutely cannot enlist civil servants and the apparatus of Government to systematically exclude news organisations that criticise them in an attempt to influence scrutiny of their actions.And it is a challenge to the freedom of the press that journalists must stand against. The alternative is to take an immoral, dishonest path towards providing increasingly obsequious coverage in the hope of avoiding being added to the blacklist.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland needs informed debate on economics of independence says derek mackay","story":"Scotland deserves an \"informed debate\" about the prospect of independence,Derek Mackay has said, amid criticism over plans of his own \"alternative\" figures on the countrys fiscal situation.The Finance Secretary claimed that the official Government Expenditure and Revenue in Scotlandfigures were a \"misrepresentation\" of the public spending implications of leaving the UK.The most recent GERS figures showed that Scotland has deficit - the gap between public spending and taxes raised to fund them - of about £ billion.It has prompted pro-union leaders to warn that Scotland would face years of ramped up austerity cuts with independence - or major tax hikes.:SNP claim Boris Johnson is trying to impersonate TrumpTory MSP Jamie Greene hit out at the plans to publish new figures setting out Scotlands fiscal position.Mr Greene said: \"Last month the cabinet Secretary said he wants to provide and alternative GERS because he feels - and I quote \"frustrated\" - when GERS are published every year.He added: \"Why are you so frustrated with these independent figures - and which impartial economic authority will independently very your figures when you produce them \"The GERS figures are published by Scottish Government statisticians, but Mr Mackay confirmed other figures relating to the economics of independence, provide a fuller picture as the SNP steps up demands for a second referendum on leaving the UK.\"As the UK Government increasingly disregards the democratic wishes of the people of Scotland, its more important than ever that we complete the necessary steps to hold a referendum on independence,\" he told MSPs.\"The Scottish Government produced a comprehensive plan for an independent Scotland in  and as we set out in our programme for Government, we will undertake the necessary work to update that plan and ensure that the people of Scotland have the information they need to make an informed choice on the future of their country.\"He added: \"We want an informed debate around the future of our country.\"Ive never challenged the impartiality of our statisticians.

I’ll try where I can to find outanybody nearby owns the property. These places are almost always in a bad state of repair – broken windows, roofs and doors missing. “If it’s somewhere that’s been left open you’re not breaking and entering and you’re not going in to commit a crime so you can’t be prosecuted for that either. Michael likes to tell a story through the items that have been left behind“You’re going in at your own risk. If you can’t get in you write it off and move on. Like I say it’s a grey area so I prefer to keep a low profile and let my pictures speak for themselves.”Michael shares the photographs he takes via his Facebook and Instagram pages entitled Forgotten Places NI: “I respect people’s privacy andI’m ever asked to take any photos down I do it straight away.“I do it for the love of old buildings and their contents, it’s as simple as that. It’s a hobby and I don’t try to make any money from it. “I had been taking photos for my own pleasure to start with but when I showed them to other people they said I needed to share them online because they were so good. That’s why I started up Forgotten Places NI.”An old ambulance found at a derelict propertyMichael’s photographs are posted with a short description of the property but little detail about the location unless it’s somewhere that’s easily recognisable. He said he likes to keep his best finds to himself: “I know a couple of other guys who do this. There’s ones who take photographs and sell them. Mine is purely a hobby.“I’ll get messages from other people asking where I’ve been. I don’t always tell them. It’s dog eat dog. It sounds stupid because there’s nothing to gain from it.

I don’t see the point. It’s finding the places and not knowing what’s going to be inside that does it for me. If you go somewhere that’s already been documented it takes the excitement out of it.”Most of the properties are in a bad state of repairHe said: “What I do I call it documenting. I go in take pictures and write a wee blurb about the place I’ve been. “Sometimes it’s a property that’s got a ‘for sale’ sign at it. You’ll come back in three months and it’s gone, it’s been flattened for redevelopment. It’s sad because when you’re in it you get a real sense of the character of the house, the essence of it.”Michael said he used to have a penchant for ghost hunting, but with his new pursuit he tries to steer clear of the paranormal: “I used to have a bit of a fascination with paranormal investigation, though I think it had more to do with the old buildings. I love walking round old places as you can pick up so much of the history from just walking around. “I used to do a few paranormal investigations so that gave me an appreciation of old buildings, the character of them, just how dferent they are to the ones now.“With Forgotten Places NI I don’t like to spook things up to be scarier than they are. That said, there’s a post I put up just this weekend about a house that I called the House of Ambivilence. It really did have mixed feeling about it. “It looked lovely from the outside, a nice farmhouse. Downstairs had a nice calm atmosphere, but when you went upstairs, honestly, you wanted to get out again, something just didn’t sit. I felt uneasy about the atmosphere. A well lived in room“That’s not generally the case, mostly you get a good feeling about the place because of the items you find in them – kids’ toys, religious pictures, birthday cards. It’s that connection I like.”Michael’s photos are largely focused on derelict properties in NI but he has also ventured into the Republic of Ireland: “Banbridge is a good location to have as a base. I can be in the south in  minutes, quicker than to get to Belfast.“For me it’s trying to find places that haven’t been documented. Everybody’s done Cairndhuand because of its popularity it has been subject to vandalism. Nevertheless it’s a fascinating place. It doesn’t matter what people do to it.” Michael, who has three children, said: “My daughter would come out with me from time to time for a wee spin. We’d trek up country roads to seewe can find any or maybe I’ll have some place marked to check out. “I’ll maybe read around online about an area to seethere’s any stories relating to old mills, old schools. You can look at satellite images before you go. We’ll maybe have eight or  places marked.“These places that I’m going into, people don’t even know they’re out there. There’s hundreds of them. I mark them on my Google Maps – there’s five or six hundred on there to explore.”Michael said he has a bank of photos stored on his phone that he hasn’t shared yet: “If I didn’t go out for another three months I’d have enough to keep posting. “Looking back at some of my older photos, they aren’t great. I think I’ve got better. “In July or August I had , likes on the page, by December it had doubled, now I’m pushing towards ,. “It’s amazing because I’m not doing anything with it, I’m just publishing photos with a small bit of a story, I’m not promoting it or trying to make money from it.”Michael is quick to point out that he is not the first person to find beauty in the Province’s derelict properties. He said Abandonned NI set the benchmark for this sort of photography.Michael said his obsession was a year-round one: “I’ll be out in winter as well as summer. In winter it’s good because the foilage dies back and you’re able to see things that would previously have been hidden. I remember once crawling through a hole and the hedge to find this property that you’d never know was there.” Asked what led him to begin searching for old houses Michael said: “It was my son who got me started, it must have been about three or four years ago. “He showed me this video on YouTube of a guy in America who was exploring this derelict mansion that used to belong to a drug dealer. “It looked fantastic, all the broken windows and doors hanging off and the stuff that was left inside. “My son said we should try to find something like that here. I said, ‘you’re not going to get something on that scale but we’ll have a look’. “What we did was we went to Cairndhu which is near Larne. It’s pretty much where everybody that does this starts. It’s so well known, it’s such a tragic story of how it fell into such disrepair. It’s so vast. As soon as I got in I was hooked.”Cairndhu which was built around  is the former home of Sir Thomas Dixon. It became a convalescent home before it was closed in .Michael said: “There are people on social media who tell me about a derelict house near to them, sometimes it can be just a shell. For me that’s not that interesting. “What I find interesting is somewhere that has personal possessions still inside. It could be furniture, it could be letters, there’s houses you go into and you’d think people had just walked out and left everything still in it.Michael said his passion was driven more by what people had left behind inside the properties rather than the buildings themselves.He commented: “Some people would look at a man in his forties out exploring the country like this as stupid, but for me it’s just that sense of adventure. “It’s good to be out and about. It’s a healthy interest and no one is harmed.“It’s like how you feel when you’re a kid when you go out exploring. “I’m not sure I was even this adventurous as a kid. Maybe I’m making up for it now.“It’s that excitement of the unknown, that danger of not knowing what you’re going to find. That’s why I do it. “It’s those wee unassuming houses that look like nothing and you go in and they’re just filled with stuff. You find out all about the owners, the le that they led.”Discussing some of the remnants of the past he has uncovered, Michael said: “You see so many of the old Singer sewing machines.“There was one house where I found the shell of a Mk II Jag. I found an old ambulance as well.“For me the best finds are the wee personal things like a Valentine’s card or a kid’s note that says ‘mummy has been mean to me and daddy’ – you’re hoping that was just a wee fleeting moment.”He continued: “I try to capture those items as they sit to tell the story of the house. “I take the photos on my phone, maybe I’ll upgrade to a fancy camera someday though photographers will tell you it doesn’t matter what you use, it’s your eye for a photo.“People say to me they can imagine a story around my posts. In my wee blurb I’ll not give the location away unless it’s a well known building. I’ll just describe it a wee bit as best I can and let the pictures tell the story.”Offering suggestions as to why houses end up derelict yet full of possessions, he said: “A lot of the time you’ll get an elderly person who will pass away, they may have nobody to leave it to or they may leave it to the family and they can’t agree what to do with it so it just sits.“Sometimes you get people who buy the property for the adjoining land but don’t knock down the original property.”Some of the items left behindThe scene in an abandonned kitchenBoots no longer made for walkingThis cupboard remains well stockedAn Evening Prayer"},{"url":null,"title":"orangemen aim to scale kilimanjaro","story":"A dozen Orangemen from Co Down are planning an ambitious trip to Africa during which they will attempt to scale Mount Kilimanjaro.The men from Banbridge District No  have a proud history of undertaking gruelling fundraising ventures, with this particular challenge requiring two years of groundwork.Deputy District Master Stuart Magill said: “In this last  years at Banbridge Orange Hall we’ve raised over £, for dferent causes and charities.“Drumming For Heroes from LOL  has raised £,. They’ve carried a Lambeg drum up to the top of Ben Nevis and cycled from John O’Groats to Landsend with a Lambeg on the back of a bike. “They also did the four peaks of the UK in four days, and walked the route of King Billy from the south of England to Carrickfergus and down to the Boyne, also bringing the Lambeg.”Banbridge Orange Hall is home to several dferent lodges including LOL  and LOL  of which Stuart is a member. “This time it will be our lodge that’s doing Kilimanjaro though we won’t be bringing a Lambeg – it’s going to be hard enough as it is,” he continued. “It’s a follow up to the Walk of Remembrance when we walked  miles from Thiepval Memorial to Menin Gate.”The -year-old added: “It was my idea to climb Killimanjaro. I’ve never done it before, that’s why I want to do it. “There’s  of us doing it. My biggest worry was getting . It’s , miles away, over Christmas, the whole trip is paid for by ourselves which is costing quite a bit of money.“In the end we got  easy, now we’re looking at maybe getting another group of . “We go on December , . There’s a big build to allow us to pay for it, the cost of the trip is coming out of each person’s pocket so that every penny raised is going to the charity. It also gives us plenty of time to train for it, and also to raise money for the two charities.”Two charities are set to benefit – the Children’s Cancer Unit in Royal Victoria Hospital and Angel Wishes which helps children with cancer and supports their families.He said the two charities were close to the hearts of those taking part in the trek as they were good friends with a family from Banbridge who are indebted to the services provided by the organisations.In pictures: NI man finds beauty in derelict properties around the Province Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Stuart said: “The oldest person taking part is in his sixties and the youngest is in his twenties. “The majority of training will be in the Mournes for fitness and stamina, but there’s no training over here really for the altitude.

I want to be in a position to make robust decisions on key issues and I hope Casement will be one of those.”Another key decision for Minister Mallon will be on the York Street Interchange, which was specied as a commitment for the Executive in the New Deal, New Approach document.“There was a procurement process that was challenged. We now have to commence that procurement process again,” she explained.“It certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed. Anyone who travels in that part of the city will know it is hugely congested when it comes to traffic. It is also bad for emissions and the climate which is one of my priorities.“I want to try and progress that but also balance it around connecting people and doing what we can to tackle the climate emergency.“The project is stated as commitment for the Executive but it also features in the New Deal New Approach and I very much welcome that commitment is in there.“Infrastructure is central to the new document and it recogniseswe are serious about transforming lives and ensuring people have real opportunities in areas were people are really struggling then we need to be investing in infrastructure.”As for a possible Glider extending to link South and North Belfast, Nichola saidone of her priorities is “about increasing public transport and people’s access to it”.“I have asked officials for an urgent briefing to see where that is but encouraging people to use public transport and encourage people to walk and cycle are priorities for me.”After three years of no Stormont Executive, Nichola said she is under no illusions to the challenges facing her around Infrastructure, including a huge backlog of work to tackle street lighting, potholes and climate change.“The financial situation that I have inherited is extremely challenging. If you look from , there have been systemic signicant budget cuts to the department.“One of the areas which has been affected has been street lighting and it is something I am very aware of. It is on people’s front doors and gives people a sense of safety and confidence.“If we want to make a dference to people’s lives, we need to address issues like street lighting and pot holes.“I would be hopeful of working with Minister Conor Murphy in the Department for Finance to secure more money to address some of these issues.“Pot holes is a big issue across the North and mainly due to budget cuts to the department. I want to try and address it.“I think we could be doing so much more in Belfast, especially around cycling. We need to encourage and facilitate parents who want to be able to walk their children to school. It will involve safety mechanisms but it is something I want to have a big conversation about with not only my officials but people as well. It is beneficial for the climate but also for people’s physical and mental health.”Asked about many people’s negative attitudes at -hour bus lanes in the city, the Minister stressed she is keeping an open mind but called for better conversations around such controversial issues.“It is about a balancing act. It is about encouraging people to use public transport but in a way to promote local businesses as well.“I have an open-door policy here and I want to engage with everyone. When we all put our heads together, that is when you get to a better place for policies and decision-making.”As for rumours of potential water charges being introduced for residents, she was quick to spell out her position.“The SDLP is opposed to water charges and I have been very quick to say that it won’t be the case under my watch.“I also welcome the fact both the First and Deputy First Minister have come out as well to say it also. I view my role as important in helping struggling families and not to add to their burden.”On a personal level, Nichola is “excited” about her role over the next two years but stressed she will not forget about her local constituents in North Belfast who elected her to Stormont in the first place.“It’s very exciting. It is a very big department. I think a lot of people think it’s just about roads but in actual fact, the department impacts on everyone’s daily lives.“Infrastructure covers things like whether houses can be built or not which is important because we have a housing crisis and other things like waste and water.“When you turn on your water tap, how you travel to and from school and work, MOT to ensure your vehicle is safe, road gritting in winter – all fall within the Department for Infrastructure.“I haven’t forgotten I am here only because the people of North Belfast elected me. I am keen while I take up this role I don’t lose sight of that and continue to be focused also on my constituency and the service I provide.“I will still be a familiar face around North Belfast. The reason that I got into politics is to serve people who put their faith in me.“I won’t lose sight of that and I am very clear that I want to be in the constituency and welcome people to still come to me with their problems and their issues because my job is to try and help them.“I am a parent too and for all parents, it is important to balance your work and your le. I am very lucky I have a supportive family. I look forward to family time and spending time with my children is important but I will do my absolute best in this role.”As for her hopes for her two-year tenure at the helm of Infrastructure, Nichola concluded: “I really want to make the most of these two years. I understand I am coming into a position where we haven’t taken decisions for three years so there is a backlog.“There are huge financial restraints but I really want to make an impact. At the end, I want to look back and ask what did I do to improve people’s lives, better connect people, have a thriving and balanced economy and an improved climate.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"edmund rice to host an evening of light","story":"EDMUND Rice College in Glengormley are inviting the public to attend a special night to support mental health across the North Belfast community.The Evening of Light will take place at the school tonight Wednesdayat pm featuring music and reflection.Music will form a reflective and peaceful atmosphere for the evening, delivered by the Edmund Rice College School Choir, current Year  pupil Robert Hamilton and musicians Two Tempo.There will also be an opportunity to hear from two key speakers from Alpsand Mind Skills and information on their respective programs on mental health, resilience and suicide prevention.The first guest speaker, Frank Diamond is an integral part of the team at Live and Learn Alps, a not for profit organisation, working directly with communities offering support, guidance and education around mental health awareness and suicide prevention.The organisation was founded in September  and has trained upwards of , people in QPRtraining.

He has alerted the relevant authorities. The site is just yards from the St Gall’s GAC clubrooms. Belfast City Council waste bags, household fridges, cemetery headstones, construction rubble, wood and huge amounts of other waste have een dumped on to the land and the massive mound is sliding close to the Ballymurphy Stream.The land is known as Milltown Glen and is situated between Maguire’s Garage, Milltown Cemetery and the Bog Meadows.Michael Culbert of St Gall’s GAC said that the issue of land ownership needs to be claried. “There is a gateway that runs from Milltown Cemetery, a lane, and it’s that land that is being dumped on,” he said. “We want a clean environment, we care about the environment. We have all age groups at St Gall’s, from six-year-olds up and have been in this area for approximately  years. We have never seen the like of this. This is a beautul glen, you have the Bog Meadows and here it’s the epitome of fly tipping. This is going on in the heart of West Belfast and it’s not on. We need someone with responsibility to hold whoever is doing this to account for the contamination of this area. We don’t want the river polluted.“It needs to stop and it needs to be cleared up and now our local councillor Steven Corr has taken up this issue.”Ulster Wildle Nature Reserve Officer Deborah McLaughlin told the Andersonstown News that the dumping has got worse since the start of the New Year.“This is an absolute eyesore and I have contact DAERAin relation to it as a lot of the rubbish will end up in the stream,” she said. “We are concerned at the level of fly tipping going on and concerned for health and safety. DAERA are aware of the issue and at the minute we are waiting to hear back from them.”Local Sinn Féin Councillor Steven Corr said the illegal dumping is “destroying the landscape”.“What we are seeing is a localised environmental nightmare,” he went on. “We are only a few feet away from this stream being contaminated. I can’t get my head around why somebody thinks it’s ok to do this. There are lorry loads of rubbish being dumped down a riverbank, killing wildle as it goes. I’ve never seen anything like this, on this scale, in West Belfast. This is fly tipping on an industrial scale, there is industrial waste on the site, glass, headstones. There is confusion as to who is responsible for the land but we would be calling on the Rivers Agency and the NIEAto work with us. Belfast City Council have offered support as their bags are also being dumped on the site. This land needs to be secured as a matter of urgency.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"martin rings the bell for the final time","story":"THE beginning of February will mark the start of spring and change for one West Belfast primary school principal as he prepares to retire.Holy Child Primary School principal Martin Short, himself a past pupil of the Andersonstown school, will hear the bell ring for the last time this week as he calls an end to the role that he has held for the past  years.“I started at Holy Child in September , I’m a local guy, came from Slemish Way, my three brothers came here, my sister went here, my three grandchildren are at the school now,” he said.“For me to think back then that I’d be the Principal of the school, it never crossed my mind but I’m so proud.”Martin told the Andersonstown News that he always wanted to teach.“I got that from the teaching and education I received at Holy Child, at St Mary’s Grammar School. The expectations in Holy Child are as high as anywhere  in Belfast and that has continued on.”Martin said that there were many moments throughout his career at Holy Child that stand out.“Our standards in literacy and numeracy, I’m very, very proud of those. We received an exceptionally good inspection report in  where there were no areas for improvement.“I took great pride in the whole business of ‘opening up the school’, so that the children could come in earlier for breakfast club, afterschools clubs. I’ve enjoyed working with our parents and the links our school has with the local post primaries in the area.“I think I’ve improved the fabric of the building. I fought to get the new windows installed and the final jigsaw of that project will be completed next month with the new windows in the foyer. We had a new roof, new heating system.“We won the big Gaelic Raffo Cup last year which was a great achievement, our shows, our choir, I’ve always been very proud of the strong links with St Agnes’ parish.”Martin spoke of the challenges he faced as school head.“The big challenge was finance. Budgetary constraints. Also the complexities of the special educational needs that children now encounter and the school having to meet those needs, was a massive challenge – all the while not getting enough funding. The big challenge of mental health within children and the influence of social media. We were three years without an Executive, with no direction from the department and that was a challenge for the school.”While not sailing around the world or taking up golf as part of his retirement plans, Martin explained that he will still be assisting and helping other schools through advisory work with CCMS.“I’ll be onhand to tell people to basically not make the same mistakes I’ve made, we all make mistakes what about trying this, try that and don’t be worrying about that too much.“I have a photo in my office from when I was here as a child, it has always reminded me to keep my feet on the ground and that the children are the most important thing.”When it comes to not pulling into the Holy Child car park next week, Martin said it will be a time of “mixed emotions”.“I will be very sad to leave the children, to leave the staff, the staff have been brilliant, the parents have been brilliant and I will miss that. I’ve done two ‘cycles of seven’,  years but I will be in and out of the school. I’m emotionally attached to this building, I’ve been here since I was four and I’m  now. I’ve loved every minute of it.”"},{"url":null,"title":"10 questions conor murphy","story":"Conor Murphy  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappConor Murphy February   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailIn November , you said everyone knew Paul Quinn was involved in criminality and smuggling.

Creator, Tony McCourt, , said a similar Facebook page exists for the Brandywell area so he felt it was only right to set one up for Creggan.  Within a day it had , members and less than a week later it has amassed over ,. Built in the s, Creggan is one of Derry’s best-known estates. It has been home to an abundance of artistic and sporting talent, including Olympic athletes, a Eurovision winner, a Top Ten rock band and international footballers. googletag.cmd.push In the late s and early s, Creggan became a byword for political resistance all over the world. On the Memories of Creggan Facebook page, people have been sharing cherished photos of relatives, historically signicant portraits of the Troubles, images of friends playing on the street, tales of famed characters from the estate, all sorts of myths and legends true and untrue, and everything in between. Former Creggan residents who have emigrated all over the world, including those from America and Australia, have joined the page to reminisce and share old tales from their childhood. “Everybody is enjoying it,” Tony explained, “they’re all sharing old memories.” googletag.cmd.push Friends contacted Tony to tell him that they can’t get their mothers off the page, one of the ladies is -years-old and is “loving all the old photos so much”. He added: “They’ve said they’re getting no housework done and no wains are being watched because they’re all too busy on the page. People are talking about their schooldays and friends who haven’t been in touch for many years are reconnecting.”  Memories Tony spent most of his childhood in Creggan and lived there until he got married at the age of . His brother, Peggy, still lives in Creggan and Tony has happy memories of “great neighbours and friends”. “The page brings back good memories. Nobody had anything but everybody shared what they had with each other.” The Troubles were never far from peoples’ minds, and people had their own troubles, but Tony prefers to recall the joyful times. “There was a lot of heartbreak at that time. But I like to remember all the positive experiences I had growing up. Playing football in the street all day when there were barely any cars around. “I remember the first TV on the street, it was the Kennedy’s and we used to go in to watch the FA Cup final. I also remember watching Popeye and the Lone Ranger. “I had a bad leg at one time and I remember a friend of mines carrying me to Grianan Fort and back again.” Moving forward, Tony would simply like to see people use the page in a positive way. “There are no real rules, we’re just asking people to keep it clean and to refrain from any insults. “Everyone is finding it funny going through all the old photos and that’s what it’s all about.” With that said Tony was off to the attic to unearth a few more boxes of photographic treasures from his boyhood.  ‘Heroes’ Peggy McCourt has lived in Creggan Heights for sixty-two years, asked what the estate means to him, he proclaimed: “Creggan means community.” He explained: “It was tight-knit no one had very much but what they had they shared be it a cup of milk to a drop of sugar, or can you lend me ma three slices of bread. “We all grew up in the Creggan, most of the families came from the Springtown Camp so hardship was a way of le but they made sure their wains were fed and watered, even going without themselves. “Then came the civil rights movement, then a full-blown war on the streets but again the Creggan community rallied around those who were affected by the conflict. “So many young people were first interned just because they were Catholic, many were arrested, put though interrogation centres and ended up in prison.” Peggy continued: “The hunger strikes took their toll on many families but no matter what went on Creggan grew into the best estate in Derry – in the world. “Growing up was hard at the time we lost so many friends and family members but it was a fun place to grow up, friendships formed that still last to this day. The friends I had sixty odd years ago are as strong as when we first met.  “No video games, all street games, football, rounders, even cricket, hopscotch, all these plus many more sitting out till  or  telling ghost stories, then you ran home the living day lights scared out of you. “Creggan is more than a council estate, its a way of le, its in your blood, we don’t even have to look anywhere for heroes, Creggan is full of them they are called ma’s and da’s.”   If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

With  minutes gone in the second-half Claudy led by a point. With their defence beginning to get the upper hand the momentum was turning in their favour. Then everything changed. The Claudy bench asked referee Mickey McCarron for clarication on the scoreline. The reported - to - was instantly changed on the scoreboard to the officials - to -, in the Monaghan sides favour. googletag.cmd.push The winning margin was more than the two point swing and there was ample time for the Derry men to recover but the remaining theme of the story was of uncertainty. The young Claudy players lost their focus at a critical conjuncture and by the time Matthew Marrons nd minute penalty hit the net, their grip on the cup was almost gone. After the game, Brian Rainey hailed his sides spirit and although they battled back against the odds. For the most part, it was a terric contest between two well matched teams but Claudy will always look back on this game with regret. They will ponder how the game wouldve panned out had the score not been changed during their spell of dominance. googletag.cmd.push When you have team of young lads fighting for every inch of the game, they look up at the scoreboard and they have been docked two points, it is hard for those young cubs to take, Rainey commented after the game. Still, they battled on and still they gave everything. Unfortunately, that decision, which wasnt explained - I dont know how it happened or how it came about - I am just very frustrated that something like that can affect the game in such a way. Claudy carried the underdogs tag but a ninth minute goal from Niall McGonagle gave them the perfect confidence boost. Oisin Kearns-Madden won a kick-out and it was Tiarnan OConnors high ball that found McGonagle on the edge of the square before he slotted home. Matthew Marron, who finished with -, notched two early Blayney points but it was Claudy who held the upper hand and were full value for their - to - lead after  minutes. A mark, called by referee McCarron, saw Niall Rice reply for the Monaghan men who swtly scored again after McGonagle spilled a kick-out and Joseph McMahon passed to Rice for another score. An energised Castleblayney side were level though Marron before centre-back Liam Martin put them into the lead for the first time after  minutes. However, it was Claudy who finished the half strongly. McGonagle, who played at midfield for the second quarter, floated a perfect ball to OConnor who cleverly snaked inside the Blayney cover before firing to the roof of the net, helping his side go in at the break - to - ahead. Like he did at the start of the first-half, OConnor won the breaking ball from the throw-in but Claudys move broke down. It was Blayney who hit the first two scores of the second-half, from Rice and Marron. A touch of McGonagle magic from an acute angle saw him squeeze over a point before the Monaghan men hit the net. Dylan McKenna made the catch at midfield and at the end of the move, Rice raced clear. Despite the clutches of Ben Cooke, he blasted to the net, giving goalkeeper McCormick no chance. In the next play, Claudy almost found the net and couldve had a penalty. Adam Murphy passed to Niall Barr who squared the ball for the in-rushing Keelin Hasson who was impeded by goalkeeper McCully in the goalmouth. Play continued before Claudy were awarded a free in and Hasson was replaced with a head injury. McGonagles free tied the game once again. The Dungiven man then slotted over the bar, with a hint of goal on, and Claudy were back in the lead. Or so they thought. After the score was changed, Claudy were shell-shocked and Castleblayney took full advantage. Marron slotted home a penalty, with defenders Nathan and Zachary McArdle chipping in with points. McGonagle had a close range free blocked by a wall of Blayney players and OConnor saw a late shot blocked by keeper McCully as the brave Claudy fightback came up short.

The le we share together is precious and I value this every day. There came a point for me personally, where I had reached that feeling of fulfilment and happiness and these feelings are what I embrace and evoke everyday in le. Drawing on my previous experiences and knowledge of The Secret as well as the process of le which had led me to this point, spurred me on to find my true passion in le. Helping others. I thought, whatI can pass on these feelings that I’m feeling  WhatI can help others to feel joy, hope and happiness whatever their environment or circumstance  So, in , alongside my business partner Chiara I set up a company Joy In The Workplace whose sole aim was to bring and implement productivity and joy into the workplace. This was my fit. The gratication and sense of fulfilment in helping others became a part of me. I knew I could do this, loved doing it and I did not want to stop here. I knew that feeling of being in a corporate environment and feeling stressed, overworked and unfulfilled and being able to approach and work with iniduals and groups who were in the same position and offer them a road to productivity and happiness in their role was le changing. I wanted to do more. In the Secret Bob Proctor was the clear definitive practitioner for me. I got in touch with the Proctor Gallagher Institute and trained in becoming a PGI Consultant The programmes set by Bob Proctor and Sandy Gallagher are some of the most effective and efficient I have ever seen and I was thrilled to become a part of it and be able to offer coaching to clients in both the U.S and Ireland. I recently was promoted within this company to Senior Coach and Account Executive which now enables me to offer some of the most elite personal development programmes PGI has to offer. Working alongside these esteemed colleagues has been a huge ambition of mine and I have learned so many invaluable skills and ideologies that I cannot wait to share with more and more clients whether personal or in a group setting. As my journey to date describes, I have achieved some great things and I am still achieving and believing every day. But there has been for quite some time, a feeling of wanting to offer something back home. I often would hear stories in the news, and reports from my hometown Derry in Ireland of the suicide epidemic which has been playing on my mind for quite some time. It is with such sadness and despair that I have felt the strong urge to help in some way. Derry is such a beautul town steeped in wonderful facts of history and monument but there is a huge cry for help and I simply cannot and will not ignore this. In understanding these facts, I have purchased a building in the city and will be hosting mindset workshops for both adults and children in the near future. It is never too early to implement positivity and to teach the importance of le and its value. In addition to this my foundation for suicide prevention is well underway as I have been working constructively with a team of like minded professionals from the city in order to structure and further develop and implement this project which I know in my heart will instil a new light of positivity and hope for those going through tough times and needing some guidance. My connection to Derry has been growing as of lately and I have found myself travelling back and forward trying to help in ious ways. Myself alongside Catrina Crillyhave set up “Bee Me LTD” which is the first children’s personal development company of its kind. We will be launching a child friendly app and host Bee Me Camps which will have a fun and friendly environment where children will learn about self-image, empowerment, positivity and how thoughts create things. We’re excited about this project and cannot wait to see it develop. My journey has come with its teachings, its blessings and its le changing moments and I for one would not change any of it. I am at this point in my le where I am seeing my dreams come to reality. I am helping others to see THEIR dreams and make them a reality. My work is not work for me anymore, it is my passion and I feel incredibly lucky to wake up everyday to the le I have and to be able to share my teachings that will help my clients achieve the le they too want. It is my pleasure and my honour. The world is ours and we can think it into whatever we want it to be. And together, we are making it happen.

It’s not an easy thing to do but the plan is on February  and  from pm to pm in the Nerve Centre there will be a photography exhibition, short film showcases and, obviously, a gig. The event will be a creative arts festival following the completion of the Education Authority’s CADi scheme that provides young people with qualications and key skills in the creative arts such as film, live sound, photography, graphic design and events management. Live sound is underlined because, obviously, it’s the most important thing in the world.The festival will contain an exhibition of photography, showcase of short films and two days of music including  bands highlighting the musical talent throughout Northern Ireland. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: Megan Watton and Oisin Clenaghan. This celebration of youth culture has been completely organised by the young people involved with the CADi project to showcase youth within the arts. This should be just about enough to keep the adults interested.Featured acts include Villa in FranceGrace Mullan,Vanilla Days, Meeks, Wasted Wild,Juno Hasson and Aimee Tourish, a bit of trad from Jordan Lively and songstress Maya Patterson, all who have been paving their way through the music scene across the north coast and Derry and in recent months.I spoke to one of the organisers, Megan Watton, and first asked what does CADi mean and what made you all want to do it in the first place  “Well, I joined three years ago it stands for Creative And Digital Innovation.“The course is one year and you get an OCN level one, two or three, depending on what age you are which is the equivalent to an A level or GCSE. “I, personally, wanted to do it because it would give me new skills and quality’s I could use in the future. It has been a programme run by the education Authority for three years and the numbers grow each year The Nerve Centre has been a fantastic help as they provide the tutors of each discipline events management, film, photography, graphic design and sound.They also have connections in the music scene which helps when booking bands,” she added. “Just that this programme has aided so many young people with their mental health and self-confidence and the out of school conditions helps. Without CADiI wouldn’t have gotten into my tech course.” Ethan Martin, who also helped organise it, said: “CADi means working with others in a small group to achieve the same goal. It’s been hard as we had to learn how to run an event, the Nerve Centre has been a huge help.”Events manager team member Clodagh McKenna, said: “The CADi Youth Takeover is an event for young people by young people. “It’s a chance to show how talented the youth of Northern Ireland is particularly in its music scene which has so many hidden gems. It also contains amazing work from the photographers, and film makers from the CADi programme.“CADi is a cross community programme aimed to give young people aged - the opportunity to gain skills in areas they wouldn’t usually get an opportunity to within school. “These include photography, graphic design, live sound , film and events management. The bulk of the programme consists of three residential weekends which lead up to the final event.“We’ve worked hard over the past couple of months to produce an event we hope the public will love. CADi really is like a second family to lots of us and you can see that when we come together. “We’ve created friends and memories that will last a letime.” AdultMarty Coyle said: “The CADi courses are a fantastic opportunity for young people to get some real-le experience in arts related subjects whilst gaining a qualication at the same time. “The upcoming two-day event at Nerve Centre will showcase the hard work they have put in throughout the course, showcase their own work as well as presenting a broad demographic of their peers within the arts throughout Northern Ireland”.

The grounds of the Gwyn’s Institute orphanage became Brooke Park - ‘the People’s Park’ - in . Since then the tree, which is located on the main avenue in the park, has aged and developed its familiar large squat trunk and its rough knobbly bark.Mayor Michaela Boyle joined the local pupils from Rosemount Primary School, St Eugene’s Primary School, St Anne’s Primary School and the Model Primary School to plant three new types of trees, which she hopes will receive the same recognition in years to come.“The Council are delighted with our prize from the Woodland Trust and in celebration of our Knobbly Tree we have planted three new specimen trees in Brooke Park - a Davidia Involucrate Vilmoriniana, a Magnolia Loebneri ‘Merrill’ and a Zelkova Serrata. Hopefully in years to come these three new trees will become as loved and as celebrated as our Knobbly Tree.“Brooke Park is one of the most beautul spots in the city, and our award-winning tree is a big part of that landscape.”Colin Kennedy, parks development manager, said it was a great honour to receive the runners-up position.“We were delighted that the Knobbly Tree in Brooke Park was nominated for the Woodland Trust’s ‘Tree of the Year’ as it’s a competition which aims to highlight and celebrate remarkable trees in the community and the stories behind them,” he said. “We were particularly thrilled given that it was the public themselves who had their say and deemed the Knobbly Tree worthy of a tree care award from the Woodland Trust. It’s a prestigious prize and something we are very proud of.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It has been downgraded to a Type II emergency unit which we believe is not sufficient. The Downe was only one of two hospitals in the past  years which had had its needs fully assessed before it was built.ldquoThere is a clearly established case for a -hour emergency service in Downpatrick operating seven days a week and nothing has happened at the Department of Health or anywhere  to suggest otherwise. Service changes were made in the past due to staffing issues, nothing .Mr McGrady also revealed that changes are planned at the Downe with surveyors visiting the hospital recently to examine where the proposed new MRI scanner will be located.He said the provision of the scanner will result in an extension being built and also open the door to allow the hospital to do so much more in terms of diagnostics and other opportunities,Campaigners also insisted at last weekrsquos meeting that space is needed to reopen  beds closed in the same week of the new Downersquos official opening in , highlighting the need for everyone mdash including politicians and Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash to work together on this particular issue and that it was time for the ldquoinjustices of the past in terms of local health care provision to be addressed.Mrs Anne Trainor highlighted the lack of investment in local hospital services in the past and said it was time that the Downe Hospital was firmly on the ldquolips of the decision makers and that the local area got its fair share of funding.Looking to the future, she saidthe Downe does become a centre of excellence for the elderly, this will pave the way for other new services to add to those already in place.She also backed calls for more beds to be provided in the Downpatrick hospital and is keen to see the local council taking an active role on health and working alongside campaigners.ldquoHealth is the single most important issue and we have been hammering home this message for years, she declared.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Council needs to play a serious role in the delivery of healthcare. The former Down Council put its hands in its pocket to help the hospital campaign but its successor has been lacking in this regard.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoWe want a fully ing hospital that provides this community with the services it needs. We already have an excellent hospital and fantastic staff, but the community deserves what everyone  has.ldquoWe also need to to engage with local medical providers who are the experts.

In addition to her work with children, Laura is also keen to show her support for the work carried out by the charity.Explaining the nature of her work, Laura said that it centres around helping children deal with emotional behavioural problems through play.She has a dedicated toolkit to help which includes sand trays, miniature toys, stuffed toys, hand puppets and books containing therapeutic stories to help deliver the so-called Play  Grow project.A qualied play therapist who is registered with Play Therapy UK, Laura has been working with children since  and previously spent time working in Downpatrick where she did her voluntary placement with Action for Children based at the Ballymote Centre.She explained that the opportunity to set up her new service came about as a result of her volunteering work with Le Change Changes Lives, with her work focusing on children aged between four and .ldquoI work with children who have emotional behavioural problems, those dealing with bereavement and loss or who have separated or orced parents, Laura continued.ldquoI also work with those who have anger of anxiety issues, those who may have become withdrawn, have communication problems or have suffered forms of abuse or nightmares. I also work with those who are being bullied or who are bullies themselves.Laura, who offers a free consultation with parents, said children can release their inner feelings through play.She explained that play is a childrsquos natural medium of self expression, highlighting the number of times children ask their parents to play with them and have a chat. Laura said children feel most comfortable in this environment.ldquoAs play is what children are comfortable with, it makes sense that you would use this method to help them through a dficult time. This is particularly effective for children who cannot or who do not want to talk about their problems.ldquoThey can play out their feelings and problems anda child wants to talk to me here of course they can do that. Some children say that they do not want to talk about whatever trauma is in their lives and I say to them that is great because they do not have to.ldquoHowever, they will still express those feelings through play and may in fact not be aware that this is what they are doing. The metaphor is very powerful in the play therapy room and children can hide behind a mask to demonstrate their feelings and using a puppet is a very good example of that.Laura said her work is a method of helping children with behavioural and emotional problems to help themselves, explaining that is the children do all the work.ldquoI am just here as a facilitator, she said. ldquoPlay therapy is not always fun and sometimes the children will encounter dficult feelings. I adopt a child-centred approach where the child leads the way and the therapist follows which is non directive.ldquoOne of the most important aspects of play therapy is the element of control. For some children when something has happened in their le or environment it is a thing which they cannot control which causes trauma. When they come here, this is the one place they can come in and say lsquoright we are doing this my wayrsquo and it can take back control.Laura described play therapy is ldquonon judgemental and said children know they are in a safe environment and can express themselves in any way in which they will be accepted or who they are.She added: ldquoThe children will learn that while here they can be themselves and they will feel comfortable to be themselves.Laura can be contacted on   or via her social media page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th January 2020 New.jpg","title":"New minister at Lissara church  ","story":"A NEW chapter in the history of Lissara Presbyterian Church opened last weekend with the installation of the Rev Alan Burke.A large congregation attended last Friday eveningrsquos service in Crossgar with the new minister looking forward to his time working in the area.For the past two and a half years, Mr Burke was assistant minister at the Loanends and Killead churches near Aldergrove.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They each received weekly book vouchers, provided by Egmont, to spend at Grfin Books, and coffee shop vouchers donated by local businesses.In , the families committed to reading with their children for  minutes per day.The bookshoprsquos owner, Mel Grfin, said:\"We were delighted to be selected to participate in this exciting project. The idea was to encourage children to experience the joy of reading for pleasure, rather than seeing it as just something they have to do for school\"Research shows that being able to choose their own books, as well as sitting down regularly to read with a parent, makes a real dference to childrens enjoyment of reading. This in turn benefits their schoolwork across the whole curriculum, not just in literacy.\"We are also grateful to the local businesses who generously donated the coffee shop vouchers to help make this happen.ldquoThe contributions of local businesses show once again what great community spirit we have here in Penarth!\"In total,  local businesses donated coffee shop vouchers.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world.

What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit.

I stressed my view that companies responsible for defects in construction must take full responsibility and urgently recty them at their own cost.Some of these housing issues are devolved, and I paid tribute to work the Welsh Government has done around fire safety, with the ground-breaking law on sprinklers in , and the ban this week on using combustible cladding on high-rise buildings.

Who they are will have a real influence on Welsh Labourrsquos prospects in  and beyond. We are the most successful part of the UK Labour family over the last decade in terms of winning elections and running a national government. However, that cannot be taken for granted. An unpopular UK leader could make our task much harder next May.The first and most important attribute the next UK leader must have is the ability to fulfil the mission of our party - to become a party of government again across the UK, not just a party of protest. I want someone who can implement our labour values in government, not just talk about them.That requires some honesty about why we took such a beating at the general election, together with the willingness and strength to do something about it. Offering more of the same would be a betrayal of people who need a UK Labour government and will condemn the UK [or what is left of it] to a further decade of the Tories.We didnrsquot get hammered in  for one reason alone - there were a number of them. Agreeing to the election in the first place when we plainly were not prepared. Agreeing to an election certain to be dominated by Brexit. Our vacillation on Brexit when people wanted certainty and leadership. The factional infighting. The demonisation of the last UK Labour government, asthat would encourage people to vote for us. I grew up with  Tory years in power and I know that things really did get better following Labourrsquos victory in .An overloaded manesto with some popular policies but without a key central message. A costed manesto that then had a huge extra spending pledge added to it, meaning that people didnrsquot believe that we were serious or credible one even the policies they liked. A staggeringly inept UK campaign that wasted the amazing dedication of our volunteers, prepared to go out in the cold and rain to campaign. Our abject failure on anti-Semitism. This and much more.Many people recognised that Boris Johnson is a dishonest man who is completely out of touch with most peoplersquos lives. Lots of people still voted for him or refused to vote Labour because they could not trust and support us. Our own people - long term Labour voters - struggled to support us. Our leader was undeniably part of the reason why. Blaming our defeat solely on the mainstream media or whichever side of the Brexit ide we favour isnt honest and will not help us to win in the future.I donrsquot much care whether someone claims they are from the left, soft left, centre or old right of the Labour Party. We all have a stake in our party and the countries of the UK. These are serious times and we need a serious figure who can nail the Tories and the clown in number ten.Irsquove been interested in what Lisa Nandy has to say and believe that Lisa and many other figures have a key role to play in rebuilding our party ndash first as a credible opposition, then as a credible alternative government at the next UK General Election.However, I think the person best placed to win the argument, and even more importantly to help us win an election, is Keir Starmer. Itrsquos not the protesting, or the taking part that counts. Itrsquos the winning and the decisions you get to make in government that can change peoplesrsquo lives and change the country for the better. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There are things being said by many that we need to listen to.But, after speaking to many of the candidates personally, and asking them all tough questions - I am backing Keir Starmer for Leader. I think hersquos got what it takes to hold this government immediately and robustly to account to build a team of all the talents and crucially that he has the vision, ideas and credibility to win again.Keir joined me on the streets of Penarth speaking to voters and local businesses during the election campaign ndash and it was clear by the warmth of the reception he received that he is someone who has the immediate credibility and credentials to be our future prime minister, and would work in partnership with Welsh Labour.He has crucial experience of public service and confronting powerful vested interests for the good of the country. He acted to prosecute MPs who had abused expenses and Murdoch journalists in the phone-hacking scandal when he was Director of Public Prosecutions.We need to win back these voters that we lost in the last general election. It was heart-breaking on election night, to see Labour lose places like Wrexham and Bridgend.The UK Labour Party must get back to being a party that votersrsquo can trust. That means we cannot just have a ldquoone more heave approach. We need someone who can speak to the whole of our country, not just one region or subset of voters, with the values and vision to win.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
