Far more people understand and accept the reality of anthropogenic climate change, and yet we seem paralysed by despair, caught in a spell of inertia, even as the most lurid of predictions – floods, fires, plagues – come to pass. I say we, but the generation born into the reality of global heating are refusing to accept this lethal status quo. The testimonies of these teens and early twenty-somethings are humbling and often thrilling. By setting up a student bank based on recycling waste, José Adolfo Quisocala single-handedly changed child poverty and environmental pollution in his town in Peru. Though their projects vary widely, these young activists have a strikingly shared sense of what must be changed, from education and the foregrounding of indigenous voices to making people appreciate the value of nature. As Hilda Flavia Nakabuye, an activist from Uganda, says: “We are a generation of scared people. But we are very persistent. And very united.” This is the kind of vision and ambition necessary from the delegates at COP26. The stakes could not be higher. If only our leaders had the courage of these kids. Olivia Laing It was in November 2013 that the urgency of the climate crisis became clear to Marinel Ubaldo. A typhoon had been forecast in the Philippines and it was due to hit the peaceful village in Eastern Visayas where she lived with her family. Initially, she wasn’t especially worried. “We had been living with typhoons all our lives – it was not new to us,” she remembers. Her father, a fisherman, told her to go to a nearby shelter that was on higher ground. It was the right decision: Haiyan hit the Philippines with winds up to 195mph, one of the world’s strongest ever typhoons. Buildings that Ubaldo had thought were strong were ripped apart in seconds. More than 7,360 people were killed or went missing and at least 4 million were displaced. The disaster dramatically altered the way Ubaldo saw the planet. “It gave me a new perspective on what the future could be,” she says. Two years later, Ubaldo won a scholarship to study social work in Tacloban, a city devastated by the typhoon, working alongside studying so that she could help her family, who had lost everything as a result of the typhoon. Increasingly, she devoted her time to fighting the climate crisis.  Ubaldo has since protested at Shell’s Manila headquarters, in front of the Wall Street Bull in New York, and helped organise the first climate youth strike in Eastern Visayas. Her proudest moment, she says, was testifying as a community witness to the Philippines Commission on Human Rights as part of their investigation into corporate responsibility for climate change. In 2019, the commission found that 47 major oil, coal, cement and mining companies could be held liable for the impact of their operations on Filipino citizens. The landmark ruling illustrated “the power of people”, says Ubaldo. “Even if you are poor, or just only one, or from a remote community, you have power. You can always call out corporations and leaders who are fuelling climate change.” Ubaldo, who now works full time on climate issues, focuses on supporting grassroots initiatives. She co-founded the group Youth Leaders for Environmental Action Federation, is a climate justice youth adviser for Greenpeace Philippines and also works with Living Laudato Si’ Philippines, an interfaith movement that advocates for the estment of coal. Her work is high risk. According to Global Witness, 29 activists were killed last year in the Philippines. It is common for activists to receive threats or be subject to “red tagging” – labelled by the state as communists or terrorists. Last year, four activists and a journalist from Tacloban were arrested for possession of firearms following an illegal raid. It has been claimed that security forces had falsified evidence and Amnesty International has called for an investigation. At the time of the raid, Ubaldo received a message suggesting she too would be arrested and moved to stay with a friend as a precaution. “The thing is,” she says, “they don’t just come for you, they come for your family, for your friends… That worries me more than my own safety.” But the threats, she says, are at least a sign that those in power are hearing your voice.“This is very personal for me. If I do not continue fighting I will feel that I am betraying the people who perished because of climatic disasters. Because they are not just numbers, they are not just climate statistics.” Who is your climate villain? “The corporations, all of them. They are profiting from our suffering.” If you had the power to make one change to combat the climate crisis, large or small, what would it be? “I would go to the community and ask them what they want and support their own grassroots climate actions. And I would let the fossil fuels stay in the ground.” Rebecca Ratcliffe Not many 17-year-olds have ground-breaking judicial decisions named after them, but as lead litigant in Sharma and others v Minister for the Environment, Anjali Sharma achieved that world first when Judge Bromberg ruled in May this year that the minister did have a duty of care not to harm children. Sharma became involved in School Strike 4 Climate in 2019 after hearing about the impact climate change had on relatives who are farmers in India. “This stuff drives people to anxiety, it drives people to tears because it’s just so real for us right now,” she says. Plenty is happening for Sharma. First, the Australian government is appealing against the duty of care ruling later this month, then she has exams. She’s also focused on her twin passions of music and netball. “At school everyone knows me as ‘that kid’. It’s completely different when I go to netball where I can be a normal teenage girl – because that’s what I am.” If you could make one change… “I’d cut all Australian government ties with mining companies such as Origin and Santos, which have constantly procured grants for new fossil fuel exploration projects and influenced Australia’s climate policy due to their Australian political connections. Instead I’d have our climate policy influenced by our First Nations people and those on the frontlines. These are the people who have a true connection and love for the land.” Meg Keneally For years, twice a day Aadya Joshi walked past a scrapyard in her neighbourhood of south Mumbai on her way to and from school. Originally meant to be the garden of the local police station, it had become an overgrown, toxic eyesore with a decade’s waste festering in the heat. When she was 15, in her summer holidays, Joshi decided to do something about it. “I walked in to the police station and was like, ‘Can I please clean your garden?’” recalls Joshi. “It took three or four weeks of me just being like, ‘Please, please, please, please, please,’ and coming back every day, rain or shine. I had to convince them that I was not going to flake halfway and leave them with more work.” The plot of land is long and thin: about the dimensions of a cricket wicket. But, over the course of four Sundays in the summer, with help from local residents, Joshi did more than clear it. She replanted it with native Indian plants and trees. It was gruelling but rewarding work: “When I say toxic I really mean it,” says Joshi. “The first day that we cleaned up I made the mistake of not wearing gloves and I was sick for two weeks.” The idea for native planting came from Joshi’s reading on the Miyawaki method of afforestation and the work of University of Delaware ecologist Douglas Tallamy. These both argue that planting the right trees can have a significant impact on restoring insect and animal bioersity. The results in Mumbai were pretty well instantaneous: monkeys now hang out at the police station, and butterflies and birds have made the garden their home. “It’s definitely difficult being a kid telling adults what to do,” says Joshi. “Not everyone is always receptive, but I think there’s a benefit with having actual science to back up what you’re saying.” After creating the garden, Joshi developed a database of 2,000 plants indigenous to the Indian subcontinent and last year was awarded the annual Children’s Climate prize, founded by Swedish energy company Telge Energi. She also began planning larger projects, but these were curtailed first by Covid, and now because she has just started as an undergraduate on the Earth Systems Program at Stanford University. Her advice for others looking to follow in her footsteps is to start small. “If you bite off more than you can chew in the beginning, you stagnate and you lose motivation,” she says. “But something small, like your neighbourhood police station, it’s very manageable.” Who is your climate hero? “Dr Douglas Tallamy. His book Bringing Nature Home is all about how native plants preserve bioersity. The whole point was to take that research and put it into a local context for India.” How do you relax? “A good book. Recently Indica: A Deep Natural History of the Indian Subcontinent by Pranay Lal and In the Kingdom of Ice by Hampton Sides. It’s very depressing, but it’s very good.” If you could make one change… “It would be to plant native everywhere.” Tim Lewis “Your beds may be comfortable for now but not for long,” Hilda Flavia Nakabuye told the 2019 World Mayors Summit in Copenhagen. “You will soon feel the same heat we feel every day.” As a child, Nakabuye watched heavy rains, strong winds and drought gradually devastate her grandparents’ farm. Cassava, matoke and potato gardens withered livestock died and eventually her family was forced to sell off the land.  “We are a generation of scared people,” she says, “but we are very persistent. And very united.” If you could make one change… “Haha, that sounds like a lot of power! Within one hour I would shut down all fossil fuel industries.” Sarah Donaldson Yusuf Baluch became an activist last year in the wake of a massive forest fire near his home town of Gwadar, southwest Pakistan, though he says the climate crisis has shadowed his life since childhood. Now he spends much of his time organising for Fridays for Future and engaging in school strikes, despite the threat of arrest from Pakistan’s military. “Giving up is not an option,” he says. “I have to fight on.” If you could make one change… “There should be climate clubs and centres everywhere, at a local level, so people can get educated – so we can fight this together.” Killian Fox Vic Barrett does not speak Polish. The tattoo artist he met did not have much English. But, during some downtime at the 2018 United Nations climate change conference in Katowice, Barrett presented his arm to him along with a rough sketch of a geometric design featuring the number “370”, the “greater than” sign and two diamonds. “We still had a pretty good time,” says the 22-year-old Barrett now, laughing. “And it was a special trip and it just felt right to somehow commemorate it.” The 370 in the tattoo refers to a measurement in parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: this was the level it was at when Barrett was born in 1999. It’s now more than 400ppm, which most scientists agree is a hazardous indicator of human-made climate change. Barrett turns serious: “The tattoo is a reminder to myself and to others that there are generations of young people who have been born into a world that we know scientifically is incapable of sustaining them,” he says. “It’s highlighting this unique experience of being a young person on the planet right now.” Barrett’s awakening to the climate emergency came in 2012, when Hurricane Sandy tore up the east coast of North America. He was living in New York and while the damage was widespread – around 650,000 homes were destroyed 8.5 million people were stranded without power – he noticed that the devastation was especially severe for low and middle-income people, whose homes were more likely to be built in flood-prone areas and who were less likely to have insurance. Aged 14, Barrett, who has black and indigenous Honduran heritage, began working with the nonprofit Global Kids and ed deep into “environmental racism”. In 2015, Barrett was one of a group of 21 young people who sued the US government for violating their fifth and ninth amendment rights by encouraging the use of fossil fuels since the 1960s. Juliana v United States has now been in the courts for a quarter of Barrett’s life and the case continues to rumble on. Much of the past six years has clearly been thrilling: speaking at the UN, hanging out with Greta Thunberg, becoming a powerful voice of youth activism. But Barrett hopes that the next generation will not have to follow his path. “I don’t really want my kids to have to sue the US federal government or to have to be environmental activists in school, to speak at the UN,” he says. “I’m sure that would be awesome for them, but I don’t want them to have to fight the way we did.” Who is your climate hero? “Berta Cáceres. She’s a Honduran water protector, who ended up being killed for fighting against a dam that was going to harm the indigenous people of her community.” And your climate villain? “Hypocritical politicians. In the US now we have an administration that claims to have more progressive values, but, for example, there are still pipelines being built through indigenous-treaty territories.” If you had the power to make one change to help solve the climate crisis what would it be? “I want to see a better version of the United Nations framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) process. Right now it’s all hired negotiators from different countries and their whole job is to negotiate. I would like to see more indigenous leaders included, more black leaders included, more leaders from the global south included.” How do you relax? “I like to go kayaking, hang out with my friends, go out to the bar sometimes, play video games. Regular kiddo stuff.” TL When he was seven, José Adolfo Quisocala created a bank for school friends in his home town of Arequipa, Peru, to save money to buy books, stationery and uniforms. Now, nine years later, the Bartselana Student Bank has 6,700 clients, all aged under 18. As well as saving, children can earn money by bringing plastic and paper to recycle at school drop-offs – the money is automatically credited to their bank accounts. Every month, the bank recycles between 15 and 16 tonnes of paper and plastic through local companies. The idea came to Quisocala when he saw children begging at traffic lights and wondered how he could help them and their families earn and save, as well as recycle household rubbish that would otherwise become litter or go into landfill. He missed out on school to pursue his idea, but it was worth it, he says. “In my town, I was able to considerably reduce the level of child poverty, the school drop-out rate and environmental pollution.” Quisocala also helped create the Bartselana Foundation, which converts donations of recyclable waste from local companies into funds to combat child hunger and improve education. Since the onset of the pandemic, the foundation has been making free online educational videos – explaining, for example, how to distinguish different types of plastics and paper for recycling – which it puts out via social media. “This is such important and relevant information that is not taught in school, that we had to make it public and free to watch,” says Quisocala. Now 16, he plans to hand over the running of the bank to a new (also young) CEO in order to go to university. He intends to continue his social activism, working with the “least-favoured or forgotten groups in Latin America” and helping them profit by carrying out environmental services. If you could make one change… “I would teach children, the young, adults and senior citizens what awaits us in the future if we continue living the way we are now. The climate plays a role in every aspect of our lives our money, our health, agriculture, our flora and fauna. With education, people can take small steps to improve the relationship between humans and nature.” Dan Collyns It was a school lesson on Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King that made sisters Melati and Isabel Wijsen think about how they could change the world and in 2013, aged 10 and 12, they launched Bye Bye Plastic Bags, an initiative to stop single-use bags which is now active in 30 countries. “It organically started to grow,” explains Melati, now 20. “Young people could see a real-life example of what was possible.” The girls’ campaign was exemplary. They started making educational booklets to explain the dangers of marine pollution and set up a pilot scheme for a plastic-free village. Next came a how-to video on making a river barrier from recycled material to prevent rubbish reaching the sea and a social enterprise scheme employing local women to make reusable bags. In 2018 they resorted to hunger strike when the governor of Bali wouldn’t meet and discuss government policy. He caved in two days later and by 2019, single-use plastic bags were banned from the island. Now the Wijsens have launched an online learning platform called Youthopia. “It has masterclasses, workshops and mentorship. We want it to become the world’s HQ for young change-makers.” It’s hard to imagine they won’t make it happen. If you could make one change… “I would adapt the education system to teach about these problems and create spaces for innovation. Young people are not given the tools or the guidance to think big and create new systems.” Alice Fisher Scarlett Westbrook is a 17-year-old with an open expression, friendly smile and plaits like bell-pulls. It would be natural to assume – had you never heard her speak – that she was an ordinary schoolgirl and not the formidable climate justice activist she is. But by the age of 10, Scarlett was already going on marches and canvassing for local elections (at the time, she was “really into” Ed Miliband’s climate policies). She has grown up in inner-city Birmingham and her encouraging parents – not in any political party themselves – would tag along with her as she knocked on doors. It must have been clear then that Scarlett was not born to be one of life’s passengers. At 13, she distinguished herself by passing an A-level in government and politics – the youngest person ever to do so. She taught herself in seven months. Her speciality was climate and education which was what, in part, led to her later work as a member of the UK Student Climate Network (UKSCN). Neither her parents nor her teachers believed Scarlett when she told them she intended to sit the A-level, so Westbrook emailed the exam board… “I kept arguing until I got my way!” (A useful talent in an activist.) Westbrook has been one of the leading organisers of the school strikes in Birmingham and is the youngest known “regular policy writer” in parliamentary history. She won the Women of the Future Young Star award in 2020 and the Diana award this year, for humanitarian work. Scarlett is invariably modest about her achievements – not wishing to distract from what matters most to her. She now heads up Teach the Future, the impressive student-led campaign founded by her friend Joe Brindle, which aims to transform the British education system by putting the climate at its centre. It is responsible for “the first ever student bill, the English Climate Emergency Education Act” and for holding a parliamentary reception, organised and led by Westbrook, for more than 100 MPs and Lords. (It has secured cross-party support from everyone except the DUP.) She argues that climate should be “woven like a golden thread into every single subject”. And her own thinking proves impressively joined up: she talks eloquently about climate crisis in relation to capitalism, colonialism, gender inequality and pandemics. How do you relax? “It often feels like the weight of the future is on our shoulders so it is really important to wind down and spend time with people you care about to maintain your capacity to act, and your wellbeing.” Solar or nuclear? “Solar!” If you could make one change… “I would implement an international Green New Deal, which would aim not only to decarbonise the economy through a 10-year, government-led mobilisation but also to create jobs and to bridge the inequality ide through investment in the areas that need it most.” Kate Kellaway “My two loves are exploring and inventing,” says 20-year-old Fionn Ferreira, who won the top global award at the 2019 Google Science Fair for his work on reducing plastic pollution in water. It was while kayaking around the coast of West Cork, where he grew up, that Ferreira became keenly aware of the problem – not just large plastics bobbing on the waves but microplastics pervading the water around him. Aged 15, he designed his own spectrometer to measure the amount of microplastics in local water – the readings were so high that at first he thought the machine was broken. Then he set about finding a way to remove them. “I thought, what’s plastic made of? It’s made of crude oil. And why does crude oil float on top of water? Because the polarity is different.” By adding magnetite to oil, he discovered that he could attract the microplastics in a sample of water and remove the vast majority of them with a magnet. Winning awards and backing at such a young age has given Ferreira a sense that youth should not be a barrier to effecting real change. “I feel like we need more people involved in innovation and invention at a small level, because every idea has the power to make a difference,” he says. If you could make one change… “We need to get everybody to fall in love with the environment and be really, really angry about what’s happening to it. Because only with everybody on board, doing their bit, can we create change.” KF Mya-Rose Craig was nine days old when she first went birdwatching near her home in Bristol. “My parents and my older sister were massive birdwatchers. I can’t remember a time when I didn’t love birds,” she says. She has been blogging about birds as Birdgirl since she was 11 and posting on Twitter as @BirdgirlUK since the age of 12. “That was when I started becoming passionate about environmental issues, especially climate change,” she says. It was also around this time she started noticing something about outdoor spaces. “My mum is Bangladeshi and my sister and I are half Bangladeshi and I became aware that I never saw anyone who looked like us out in the countryside. As I looked into it, I realised this wasn’t a superficial thing, it was systemic exclusion linked to the racial make-up of conservation bodies and the costs of getting into nature, among other things. Conversations with my cousins made me aware that birding and being in the outdoors are seen by non-white people as really white hobbies.” Craig set up Black2Nature, a non-profit organisation that campaigns for equal access to nature for all, runs nature camps and activities for people traditionally excluded from the countryside and campaigns to make the nature conservation and environmental sectors ethnically erse. Her activism has won her a platform on television (Springwatch, Countryfile) and radio (Start the Week) and a doctorate in science from the University of Bristol. Now 19 and studying at Cambridge University, Craig has just published We Have a Dream (Magic Cat), a book of interviews with 30 young environmental activists of colour – “people who weren’t getting the platform from the media that they deserve”.  If you could make one change…. “I’d get genuine action from our leaders, right now.” Lisa O’Kelly Dubbed “France’s Greta Thunberg” by the French media, Iris Duquesne was 16 when she joined 15 other teenage climate activists, including Thunberg, in late 2019 to bring a landmark legal complaint to the United Nations against France, Brazil, Germany, Turkey and Argentina. Their charge – that these countries were violating their rights as children by not taking sufficient measures against climate change – resonated around the globe. Last week the UN declared it was unable to rule on the case, saying the young people must first bring lawsuits in each of the five state’s national courts, despite tomes of case law showing that no such procedures would succeed. Speaking through her legal team at the non-profit Earthjustice, Duquesne said: “We are all very disappointed but unfortunately not surprised. We have seen governments and officials ignore the climate crisis over and over again and today was no exception. The fight for climate justice is not over, and we will keep pushing with or without the Committee’s help.” If you could make one change…. “I’d use education worldwide to instil a real sense of climate responsibility in the next generation.” LO’K Jakob Blasel’s blond curls have been a regular sight at Fridays for Future protests in Germany since the then 18-year-old organised the country’s first climate strike, outside the regional parliament in Kiel in December 2018. He proved a canny organiser and passionate motivator, rallying students through WhatsApp chat groups or by spraying messages on the pavement outside their schools. “From day one it was very important to me that Fridays for Future wasn’t just made up of kids who already cared about environmental issues,” he says. “It was about starting a movement that spoke to an entire generation.” Three years later, Blasel is knocking on the doors of the Bundestag in Berlin: as a Green party candidate in his home constituency in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany’s northernmost state, he gained 23,831 votes at September’s federal elections, only narrowly missing out on a parliamentary seat via the party’s list. The eldest of three brothers, Blasel says he was vaguely aware of climate change as a child. “But it wasn’t until I was 15-16 that the climate crisis became something that caused me distress.” In 2017 he watched a Norwegian documentary about the global textile industry. “How could it be, I asked myself, that my teenage peers and I were wearing clothes that were produced under inhumane conditions in the global south? From that, I moved on to thinking about how clothes could be produced in a way that was not just socially fairer, but also more environmentally sustainable.” The teenager started wearing more secondhand clothes, and he convinced his parents to switch to get their electricity from renewable providers. “But there was a point where that approach reached a limit: even if I change my behaviour as a consumer, we’re still headed for an ecological and societal crisis. If I really cared about making a difference, I realised, I needed to take a political approach.” In his campaign and on social media, Blasel describes himself as an “1.5C ultra”, claiming a term usually employed by fanatical football supporters. “Maybe that’s a little bit of a joke,” he says, “but in terms of real politics, it means I am convinced that every possible effort needs to be made to limit global warming to 1.5C. “Now I see a lot of politicians realising that we need to have more ambitious climate targets. But they are still telling fairytales about how we will get there: that technology will magically solve climate change, that we just need to leave it up to the markets. We already have these technologies, we just need to use them. And at the moment that’s not happening to the right extent.” Blasel says his run for the Bundestag has made him understand better why the political debate on the climate crisis has got stuck, and how it could be made to start moving again. “Being an activist means constantly pushing your own interest to the foreground, while the art of being a politician lies in reconciling different interests.” The German Green party could hold a key role in the next government, as one of three coalition partners in a liberal-left power-sharing deal. Blasel says he’s planning to slip back into his old activist roles to remind his party of its promises while coalition talks are ongoing. “I will keep on giving my best to fight the climate crisis. Whether I do that from parliament or as an activist is almost irrelevant.” Who is your climate hero? “Stefan Rahmstorf, the German climatologist who was one of the earliest scientists to lay bare the dramatic extent of the climate crisis.” Solar or nuclear? “Solar. People don’t feel safe around nuclear power plants. I don’t think most people who are still evangelising about nuclear power have thought their position through.” If you had the power to make one change to help solve the climate crisis what would it be? “The switch to renewable energy has to be the basis for every step we take to address the crisis.” Philip Oltermann Disha Ravi experienced climate change growing up in rural India long before she knew what it was. “My grandparents are farmers and faced water shortages my mother had to carry water from the common well before she left for school and none of us realised that this was the result of the climate crisis. Only when I was 18 did I understand it – and the inaction from our leaders.” Ravi co-founded the Indian branch of Fridays for Future (FFF) in 2019 and spent two years organising workshops, local clean-ups and tree planting. She is also the family breadwinner, with her job at a vegan food company in Bengaluru, where she lives with her mother. One campaign close to her heart was the 2020–2021 Indian farmers protest when a set of farm bills that seemed to favour corporations over farmers sparked huge outcry in India, especially over minimum prices for produce. When Greta Thunberg tweeted about the campaign in February, it was Ravi who made international headlines. She was arrested for sedition and criminal conspiracy and taken to Delhi where she was held for 10 days. Police said a social media toolkit Ravi had edited for the campaign had caused disaffection and disinformation. Ravi is unable to discuss her ongoing legal case but her campaigning spirit is undiminished. “I have seen my own house fill with water in a landlocked city, trees cut to grow the GDP, and poison released in rivers as businesses push off responsibility. I refuse to let this continue for others.” If you could make one change… “People in India face the climate crisis on a daily basis, but access to the latest science around the environment is still limited to elite private schools. Education will bring about awareness and the climate action we need.” AF Lesein Mutunkei was 12 when he decided that for every football goal he scored, he’d plant a tree. He realised the idea could go big – after all, “the climate crisis is a universal problem and football is a universal game”. He got his school in Nairobi signed up and started Trees for Goals as a movement. In 2019, aged 14, he went to the Kenyan Ministry of Environment and the scheme became national. This year he’s a Children’s Climate prize finalist. If you could make one change… “I would ensure Fifa, all leagues, clubs and schools and 3.5 billion fans across the world took up Trees for Goals and use the power of football to tackle deforestation, which is the second biggest contributor to climate change.” AF Amy and Ella Meek founded Kids Against Plastic in 2016 after finding out for the first time about the effects of plastic pollution. The sisters were being home schooled and their parents, both teachers, decided they should learn about the UN’s global goals for sustainable development. The goal that piqued their interest was number 14: Life below water. “We started seeing all these images of sea creatures tangled up in plastic,” says Amy, now 18. “It was just heartbreaking to see and really shocking.” “Plastic pollution wasn’t so much in the news then, so we were completely unaware of how the plastic we were using and throwing away was having such a negative impact,” says Ella, 16. “We realised that a lot of other ordinary people were probably unaware of it too, so we decided to take action.” Their campaign against plastic waste had small beginnings. “We were quite young, only 10 and 12, so we started off by litter picking. As soon as we started picking up plastic we saw how quickly it was being replaced and that was really motivating,” says Ella. In the five years since the sisters have picked up a massive 96,685 pieces of single-use plastic. Their target is 100,000, because that is the number of sea mammals that die each year as a result of being trapped in plastic or eating it. They have also given hundreds of talks at schools and festivals, including a TEDx talk, and launched nationwide “Plastic Clever” schemes to help UK schools, restaurants, businesses, festivals and councils to reduce the amount of single-use plastic they use. How do you both relax? “We’re just normal teenagers so if we’re not campaigning we’ll spend time together, watch TV, read books, talk to our friends.” Lab beef or grass-fed? “We’re vegan!” If you could make one change… “We’d make sure people with the power to take action take on board advice from young people.” LO’K In 2019, Noga Levy-Rapoport, just 17 at the time, was instrumental in organising the massive 20 September climate strikes across the UK. This involved “months of tireless work – emails, backroom meetings, travelling from school to workplace to company HQs to persuade as many as we could to join us on the streets”.

If you could make one change… “I’d ensure governments and global leaders put an end to the greenwashing that corporations are constantly using. Greenwashing places all responsibility for an international, terrifyingly huge crisis on us as consumers, rather than on fossil fuel companies for taking advantage of our people and planet. Corporations like BP and Shell, responsible for so much damage to our environment, know that a decarbonised world is possible, a sustainable future and equitable society is possible, but for that to exist we have to end the unregulated power they have over our energy, jobs, and livelihoods.” KF A Colombian-American from Seattle, Margolin founded the coalition Zero Hour in 2017, which led the Youth Climate March the following July. She was one of 13 children who sued the state of Washington in 2018 for infringing their constitutional rights by “actively worsening the climate crisis”. She now studies film-making at NYU, continuing to campaign climate matters and queer rights. If you could make one change… “I would halt all deforestation and destruction of natural places.” KF “I was eight years old and attending a water ceremony in a First Nations community not far from mine,” says Autumn Peltier, recalling the moment that spurred her to become a clean-water advocate. “I went to the bathroom and all along the hallways there were signs that read ‘Do not drink the water’ and ‘Boil water advisory in effect’.” Quizzing her mother afterwards, she learned that the drinking water in this community, in northern Ontario, Canada, had been contaminated for 24 years. Now, aged just 17, Peltier is chief water commissioner for the Anishinabek Nation. She first attracted attention when, at the Assembly of First Nations in 2017, she told prime minister Justin Trudeau that she was “very unhappy” with his record on water protection and oil pipeline projects. The following year, she addressed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on the subject of water pollution. “Those platforms tell me that my message is being heard and Canada has to answer at that level,” she says. “It shows me I’m being effective for the water, the children and our rights as indigenous people of this land.” If you could make one change… “I would encourage any new member of parliament to spend a week on the land and in a community that can’t drink water and live in the houses that need repairing.

Photograph: iStockThe most important step in introducing carbon budgets in Ireland and applying CO2 limits across the economy will be triggered in coming days when the Climate Change Advisory Council (CCAC) issues its key recommendations to the Government.It is understood the council is set to have a meeting to finalise its recommendations on maximum CO2 levels that should be consistent with an already-adopted legally-binding cut of 51 per cent by 2030 – for the first two five-yearly budgets.This initial recommendation will be brought before the Oireachtas and will be incorporated into a new climate action plan to be announced by the Government later this month. It is then required to set out how the “carbon budget pie” is to be ided across sectors before final approval by the Oireachtas. It will have to add up to a reduction of more than 30 million tonnes of CO2 based on current annual generation of 62 million tonnes to stick within Paris Agreement limits.Sources have confirmed CCAC experts are evaluating likely greenhouse gas emission reductions based on specific ranged limits. As anticipated, the electricity sector will have to do most heavy lifting by cutting emissions by 70-80 per cent under the terms of two carbon budgets over the next 10 years with a 2018 baseline – as increased electrification will be the critical driver in decarbonising the economy over coming decades. Agriculture faces an emissions cut of 21-30 per cent but a Government commitment to reduce levels of “superwarming” methane gas under an international EU-US pact means decarbonisation in the sector will have to be at, or close to, the higher figure.Transport and housing have been set target ranges of 45-55 per cent, while carbon-intensive industry will need to cut emissions by 40-50 per cent.Government departments are obliged to prepare detailed sectoral carbon budgets based on the CCAC’s headline recommendations and its technical analysis, which will then have to be approved in the Dáil. These will include demanding targets for households, farmers, manufacturing and businesses.Land use and the forestry sector will be separate to agriculture, ie given its own targets for carbon removals through planting trees and rewetting of peatlands. It is understood land use proved to be the most challenging issue for the council in recent months, mainly because it is a significant net source of emissions, generating 5 million tonnes of CO2 a year, and it is difficult to establish that permanent carbon removals have taken place.‘Best practice’Meanwhile, an independent review of the new Climate Act has questioned the independence and resourcing of the council. Revisions to the previous act, which is the Government’s main policy instrument on climate action, puts Ireland “in the realm of international best practice”, though there are shortcomings, concludes Dr Diarmuid Torney of DCU Centre for Climate and Society.The 2021 Act is reinforced by strengthened targets, notably the commitment to “climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest”, the review commissioned by Friends of the Earth (FoE) adds.The main weaknesses, Dr Torney identifies, relate to the independence and resourcing of the CCAC, and particularly the role of Teagasc on the council.“Given it took a 14-year campaign to get this climate law, it is good to see the study finds it is broadly in line with international best practice,” said FoE director Oisín Coghlan.“The one place where the study finds the Irish law is an outlier is having the heads of state agencies like Teagasc on the CCAC, where it creates questions over the independence of the Council. As the Council is currently deliberating on momentous decisions about the carbon budget its independence is crucial and it will need to demonstrate it is free from the influence of any vested interest,” he added.“And the study makes clear that the climate law is just the framework for action. Now the real work begins as the Government agrees the Carbon Budgets and the measures for every part of the economy and society to be supported to do its fair share to live within those budgets,” Mr Coghlan underlined.The Council has been given a strong advisory role in the setting of carbon budgets, and by extension will play a stronger watchdog role in monitoring compliance with those budgets, Dr Torney acknowledges. “In comparison with other jurisdictions, however, the CCAC remains an outlier regarding its composition, which could undermine its perceived independence. These concerns remain unaddressed in the 2021 Act. Concerns persist also regarding resourcing of the CCAC, potentially undermining its ability to fulfil its remit fully, he adds.Climate action at the scale and speed required to meet the State’s international obligations is much more than a technocratic exercise, Dr Torney says. “It requires sustained cross-party consensus on the direction and speed of travel, though of course parties may well continue to disagree on specific policy details. It also needs buy-in from societal stakeholdersand citizens,” he notes.While it represents an important development, the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 “should be viewed as the beginning and only the beginning of a new chapter in the story of Ireland’s climate action”."},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker how many people have been inoculated in ireland","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

Worryingly, it is rising again.To take a local example, Waterford has the highest vaccination rate in the State, at 99.9 per cent, yet it also has the highest incidence of any county.None of this means that vaccines are not effective, as Prof Cillian de Gascun, director of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, pointed out at the weekend. (Though it clearly shows they are not completely effective.)Prof de Gascun explained the current vaccination uptake is not enough on its own to suppress or eliminate the virus.He highlighted the areas of weakness. We have 88 per cent of over-12s vaccinated, but that translates to only 75-80 per cent of the overall population.Then, there is the effectiveness of the vaccine, which he estimates at no more than 75 per cent.Reproduction numberAgainst this, the delta variant has an estimated reproduction number of between five and eight, meaning on average one case will pass the virus on to between five and eight others.To end the pandemic, we need to ensure sufficient people are protected against the virus, either through natural or vaccine-induced immunity. This proportion of the population is necessarily higher because this variant is so transmissible.Prof de Gascun reckons we need to reach a community-level protection threshold – a term he prefers over “herd immunity” – of 80-88 per cent in order to be able to eliminate the virus. His assessment is that we are unlikely to reach this threshold using the current first generation of vaccines alone – that is, without additional measures.Smallpox and measles have been eradicated or eliminated here, he notes, because this threshold has been reached. In contrast, mumps is still a scourge, largely because of the reduced effectiveness of the mumps component of the MMR vaccine.But why are other European countries faring better than us at present? Rates in much of continental Europe and Scandinavia are a fraction of Ireland’s.“We started at a disadvantage compared to most of western Europe,” another Nphet member, Prof Philip Nolan, contended in a weekend Twitter thread. “We were hit by a very large wave of delta infections in July, with most of the population under 50 not yet vaccinated, driving daily cases from 300 to 1,800 per day between June and August.”At the start of July, Ireland had the same incidence as Sweden – maskless Sweden – but today our rate is six times higher.For a time, that didn’t matter too much, as most of the cases were among younger people, and mild. Even the return to school was weathered, with cases among young children rising, and then falling again, in line with predictions.But then older, more vulnerable people were infected, resulting in more hospital admissions – 60 per cent of ICU patients at present are over 65.Proximity to UKIt still isn’t clear why our figures are so bad relative to other countries. Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has pointed the finger at our proximity to the UK, and the graphs for cases for the two countries over the last six months are similar.One theory is that mildly infected children are bringing the virus home in greater numbers, now that routine contact tracing in schools has ended. Others emphasise the waning effectiveness of vaccines – though this would surely impact on our European neighbours as well.Prof Nolan believes the increase in cases is most likely due to a mix of increased mobility and social contact since late September, slippage on transmission prevention measures, and more social mixing indoors.Even allowing for the first and third points here being essentially the same, other countries have gone down the same road without the same outcome. Denmark, for instance, completely removed restrictions over a month ago, and does not seem too bothered about the subsequent rise in cases.One difference between Ireland and some of the more successful countries in Europe is the minimal role assigned to rapid antigen testing here. On the other hand, the UK has spent three times more than any other country on antigen testing, and it has the worst Covid figures in Europe.The situation is complex, and the future hard to ine. It was easier to predict trends earlier in the pandemic, but there are more moving parts to the equation than before. It is perfectly possible to suffer outbreaks and surges that affect particular groups (such as the unvaccinated) and areas, while the rest of society continues relatively unaltered. We may have to get used to that situation.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"budget 2022 main points what s in it for you","story":" journalists look at the political and economic impact of the multi-billion-euro Budget 2022.

Photograph: Nick BradshawFormer Stormont first minister Peter Robinson has accused the EU of “irrational political prejudice” and warned that it must “go back to the drawing board” over the Northern Ireland Protocol. The ex-DUP leader described reforms to the post-Brexit arrangements outlined by European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic on Wednesday as an “upgrade” but insisted “much more movement will be required” to bring unionists on board.He suggested triggering the contentious Article 16 of the protocol - which allows the EU or UK to unilaterally suspend aspects of its operations if either side considers them to be causing “economic, societal or environmental difficulties” - may be necessary “to achieve that goal”. Mr Robinson also accuses the SDLP, Alliance and Sinn Féin of a “grovelling endorsement” of the EU’s proposed reforms, which would scrap most checks on goods moving between Britain and the North.The de facto Irish Sea border was erected under the protocol, agreed by London and Brussels, to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and protect the EU single market after the UK pulled out of the bloc. “What gets me most is the irrational political prejudice and overbearing haughtiness of the EU, who think that it is a greater priority to ensure there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland than between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom of which we are part,” Mr Robinson wrote in his weekly column for The Newsletter. Favoured by nationalistsHe alleged that Mr Sefcovic was only interested in protecting gains from the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement which are favoured by nationalists. The 1998 peace deal was “damaging” and “it is heresy for any unionist, especially with the benefit of hindsight, to praise” it, he wrote. Mr Robinson said the agreement “threw the jail gates open for terrorists to flood out, destroyed the RUC, allowed Sinn Féin into government while republicans held on to their bombs and guns, continued murdering, relentlessly persisted with their criminality, while refusing to support the police or recognise the authority of the courts”.He said he was “unimpressed” by the SDLP, Sinn Féin and the Alliance party offering a “grovelling endorsement of the EU proposals”. “These parties welcomed the protocol in its original form and there would have been no change if it had been left to them,” he wrote. “They are content to maintain the denial of democratic accountability for laws that will be made by the EU and imposed in Northern Ireland. They accept that the EU should be both advocate and judge in its own cause when there is a dispute about trading matters.‘Sleight of hand’“They endorse the constitutional sleight of hand that declares Great Britain to be a ‘third country’ in relation to Northern Ireland trade and they applaud maintaining checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain.”Mr Robinson said the EU was also completely ignoring “ the constitutional, legal, and democratic implications of the protocol and seems to think it is only the trading element of the protocol that needs to be considered.”“Even in that narrow perspective they fall short. If the problem was limited to the costly compliance requirements and time-consuming checking of goods within the United Kingdom the answer is the removal of those checks, not a reduction in their number,” he wrote. Reacting to Mr Robinson’s comments about the Belfast Agreement, Taoiseach Micheál Martin on Friday said: “I am surprised at that language but I haven’t heard that sentiment. “I met with all of the political parties last Friday, all of them articulated to me a desire to maintain the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, the Assembly and the Executive to ensure the continuation of political stability.”Mr Martin also defended the latest set of proposals from Mr Sefcovic and the EU, pointing out that Mr Sefcovic had very carefully and very deliberately gone to Northern Ireland to hear from all shades of political opinion there before coming up with his latest proposals.“First of all,Maros Sefcovic went to the North, he met with all the political parties and he met with all of the representatives of business and industry in Northern Ireland and he listened at first hand. I would have met him before he went to the North, his objectives are genuine and sincere in trying to make the protocol work for all of the people of Northern Ireland,” said Mr Martin.Mr Martin said he recalled a conversation with Mr Robinson some years ago when Mr Robinson lamented the fact that Northern Ireland did not have the equivalent of the IDA to attract in foreign investment as the agency was doing in the Republic.“I believe having access to the Single European Market is a huge advantage to jobs and to business and to industry in Northern Ireland and the measures brought forward by the commission this week through Maros Sefcovic really advance that agenda in terms of inward investment into the North but also allowing businesses in the North to grow through exports to the European Union market,” said Mr Martin.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Growing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed schools get pupils every russell group university","story":"When parents are deciding which school to send their child to, there are a number of factors they will want to consider.

though critics question if it offers value for money.Recommitting to announcing new funding by the end of this parliament would mean that a decision must be taken before May 2024, the latest point the general election can be held.Government financing could take the form of guaranteed fixed price for each unit of energy produced at the site - as happened with Hinkley Point - rather than only direct investment.A government spokesman said: “Nuclear power has a key role to play as we work to build a strong, home-grown energy sector to further reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and exposure to volatile global gas prices.“We are seeking to approve at least one more large-scale nuclear project in the next few years to strengthen energy security and create thousands of jobs.”The push to fund a new nuclear power plant is only one strand of the renewed focus inside the Government at growing Britain’s nuclear industry.Boris Johnson is understood to view the lack of expansion in the UK civil nuclear industry over the past decade as regrettable.The Prime Minister named “advancing nuclear as a clean energy source” as one of the 10 points in his “green industrial revolution” plan published in November 2020.For years, there has been an interest within the Government about funding the next generation of nuclear power technology, specifically small modular reactors.Mr Johnson’s Government has been holding talks with Rolls-Royce about taxpayer money going to help the company’s push towards such technology.However, it is understood there is frustration within parts of Downing Street that the company has not moved at a quicker pace on the project.Some £385 million is already available from the Government through the “Advanced Nuclear Fund”, with up to £215 million set to be spent on smaller-scale power plant technology.Discussions about nuclear power have been complicated by the involvement of Chinese companies in the construction of plants within the UK in the past. In the last half decade, the mood in Parliament and within the Government has become more critical of Beijing’s increasing economic might and influence on the world stage.Critics have questioned the involvement of the Chinese state-owned China General Nuclear Power Group in building Hinkley Point C, the plant in Somerset that was approved in 2016.The Net Zero strategy is one of several government announcements on energy and climate change targets expected in the next fortnight.Another document set to be published shortly is the Heat and Buildings Strategy, which is expected to ban the sale of new gas boilers by 2035 and urge the use of heat pumps instead.Cop26 is seen as a major international test of Mr Johnson’s leadership. It lasts for a fortnight, starting at the end of this month, with world leaders attending the opening days.More from NewsBus services in crisis as drivers lured away to fill lorry vacanciesBritain faces ‘wave of terror attacks plotted by bedroom radicals’Sir David Amess murder suspect had considered killing other MPs, the  understandsFather of alleged jihadi suspected of killing Sir David Amess had himself faced Islamist threatsWe have been in denial about the violent sickness in British societyRoyal College of Paediatrics head calls for an end to Covid testing in schoolsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"have denial violent sickness british society","story":"As everybody debates the security of MPs and the tenor of our politics, we are in danger of missing a broader point. For we ought to be asking ourselves: what sort of society have we become?The suspect in the murder of Sir David Amess has been detained under the Terrorism Act and police have said that early investigations suggested a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism. We may not know the full details of this terrible crime for some time, but sadly, by then, our attention will probably have moved on.After the conviction of Wayne Couzens, for example, the police officer who murdered Sarah Everard, the country agreed the police had to change. Yet last week it emerged that West Midlands Police refused to answer Freedom of Information requests asking how many serving officers had been charged with rape. The answer, when it was dragged out of them, was three – in just one force – in the last three years alone.The examples go on. Five years ago, Jo Cox was murdered by a neo-Nazi, but the threat of violence from the extreme Right is growing. And this is not even our greatest danger. In Cox’s former constituency, Batley and Spen, a teacher remains in hiding after showing depictions of the Prophet Mohamed in a lesson, and the recent by-election there was marred by sectarian campaigning.We are in denial about the sickness of our society. We choose not to accept the reality before us – that hate, extremism and violence are commonplace – because that reality is scary, and confronting it is complex and hard. For many politicians, it means grasping issues that they find embarrassing, and saying what they lack the bravery to admit.This is especially apparent when it comes to hatred and violence perpetrated in the name of Islam. After so many plots and attacks, we have become inured to bloodshed. The pattern is always the same: we have a brief period of anguished conversation before returning quickly to normal.Commentators raise economic and social exclusion, but the perpetrators are often educated and well-off. Some raise foreign policy, as though extremism is caused by the wars of the last 20 years, rather than the other way round. Some blame our imperial history, as though Britain, uniquely, is targeted for crimes we committed, uniquely, centuries ago. Tell that to the people of Norway, who suffered their own terrorist atrocity last week.In other criminal contexts, we call this victim blaming. Instead, we need an honest conversation about why the attacks keep happening. After all, the danger mostly comes from citizens born and raised in Britain, educated in accordance with liberal and pluralistic values, and given all the opportunities of an open, modern economy.Over the last decade or so we have started to recognise the role played by extremist ideology. Where once we focused only on the sharp end – investigating terror plots, trying to stop bombs – we understand better the need to tackle the ideology behind the threat: the ideas of Sayyid Qutb, the Muslim Brotherhood and the iniduals and organisations related to them.But this is faint praise. We were foolish to tolerate this ideology for so many years. Even now, politicians and the public sector engage, sometimes deliberately, sometimes through ignorance, with people and organisations to whom they should be giving the cold shoulder. As they do so, they confer legitimacy and perceived power to extremists, and weaken those who would stand up to them. Without continuing political leadership, the public sector will keep falling into this trap, often from fear of being labelled an Islamophobe.Yet even focusing on ideology gives us false comfort. It is reassuring to say that we distinguish between the ideology of Islamism and the great religion of Islam. But people who are not Islamists can perpetuate extremist beliefs.Hardline attitudes and behaviour among some “community leaders” are often tolerated by those who would be first to condemn them in almost any other context. Barely disguised homophobia, misogyny and anti-Semitism, discrimination against others based on their race, religion or lifestyle, and the threat of violence towards apostates and atheists, is all too common, yet all too rarely confronted.This cultural extremism is if anything as dangerous as the ideology. It is more prevalent and easier to excuse. And it creates an environment in which ideological and violent extremism can grow. In addition to Batley, we have seen the intimidation of teachers who educate pupils about homosexual relationships, isive community politics in places like Tower Hamlets, and the Trojan Horse plot in Birmingham, where hardliners took over secular state schools.Extremists wrongly claim that Islam and the West are fundamentally at odds, and say any criticism of their beliefs is a criticism of Islam and all Muslims. But the real ide is not between Muslim and non-Muslim, it is between those of us who accept the principles of living in a pluralistic society – and the norms and institutions that make it possible – and those who do not.To live in a pluralistic society is to accept a fundamental deal, in which you accept responsibilities, not just rights. You cannot just live how you choose to live, you have to respect others’ right to do so, too. And you have to respect our values, institutions and way of life: the rule of law, democracy, equality, free speech and respect for minorities.This is the real ide, and it must determine our response to extremism. We need a positive and self-confident account of our national story. And we need to accept that an “us-and-them” ide does exist, but we must decide where to draw the line. Choose the right side, choose pluralism and tolerance, we should say, and we will support you with everything we have. But choose hatred and intolerance and we will come down on you like a ton of bricks.Nothing about this problem is easy. Turning these principles into action, and making our society resilient in response to extremism, will be tough. But the first step is surely honesty about the sickness of our society.This time we must not retreat, in an absence of courage and thought, into complacency. We must admit and confront the very serious dangers we face.More from NewsBus services in crisis as drivers lured away to fill lorry vacanciesBritain faces ‘wave of terror attacks plotted by bedroom radicals’Sir David Amess murder suspect had considered killing other MPs, the  understandsFather of alleged jihadi suspected of killing Sir David Amess had himself faced Islamist threatsExclusive: Government to fund new nuclear power station as part of Net Zero driveRoyal College of Paediatrics head calls for an end to Covid testing in schoolsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"royal college paediatrics head calls end covid testing schools","story":"Covid testing in schools should be brought to an end for the sake of children\u0027s education, the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has urged.The current regime in secondary schools - where pupils are told to take two lateral flow tests each week - is causing “unnecessary chaos”, according to Dr Camilla Kingdon, president of the RCPCH.She told The  that children, who are not at risk from the virus, should not be forced to “carry the burden” of the pandemic.Headteachers have been told by ministers that many of the restrictions that were in place in the last academic year are no longer necessary. Children are now only meant to self-isolate if they have tested positive with a PCR test or have symptoms.But after detecting a rise in cases, schools and local councils across the country have started to step up measures like asking children to go back to wearing face masks and bringing in new self-isolation rules such as telling children to stay at home if a sibling has tested positive.It comes as Tory MPs are warning that the Government failed to publish the results of a review of mass testing in schools by the end of September.Miriam Cates, MP for Penistone and Stocksbridge, said that mass testing in schools is “utterly pointless” and “just another example of treating children as second class citizens”.She said it is having a “huge impact” on pupils’ attendance, adding: In my constituency, absence rates are considerably higher than normal. Not all those children are actually ill but because they have had a positive test they are not allowed in school for ten days.“There is absolutely no reason to continue with mass testing children. All it’s doing is prolonging the disruption and prolonging the fear.”This week it emerged that Eton College has gone into lockdown with some pupils confined to their boarding house for 48 hours after a rise in cases.There are also concerns about the number of false positives arising from lateral flow tests, with the latest official data showing that they are on the rise among school children. This week the UK Health Security Agency said it was looking into why this might be.Steve Brine, the Conservative MP for Winchester, said that constantly asking children to take Covid tests is “hammering” away at their mental health.“We can\u0027t carry on with this mass asymptomatic testing forever,” he said. “The country is looking the other way, many people have moved on from the pandemic. But in the world of education it is still a pandemic. What happened to the end of September review, what evidence was put to ministers?”He said there are a “heck of a lot” of MPs who want to see testing in schools wound down, adding: “I simply don’t understand what the strategy is any more. I thought it was to project the vulnerable. We have long ago done that and are now well progressed in booster jabs. It seems to me that ‘Zero Covid’ strategy is alive and well.”Karl McCartney, MP for Lincoln, said tests are causing needless disruption in schools. “More and more parents across the country are beginning to say that it’s not a nice thing to have to do and certainly not twice a week. It’s an imposition on their lives and freedoms, and it’s treating them differently to adults.”Many parents feel it is “unconscionable” to impose a greater burden on children than the rest of society, according to Molly Kingsley, co-founder of the parent campaign group UsForThem.“The general feeling from parents is that this has just gone on for too long,” she said. “These measures are not benign, we shouldn’t be disrupting children’s education, save in the most exceptional of cases.”Prof Allyson Pollock, an expert in public health at Nottingham University, said the biggest problem with lateral flow testing in schools is that there has been no evaluation of its effectiveness.“The whole purpose of a test is to try and stop transmission and infection,” she said. “We have no evidence to show that mass testing in schools will do that.”The RCPCH has called on the Government to allow schools to “rethink” their approach to managing Covid, saying: “Children and teenagers need to focus on their education and school attendance must be encouraged without being interrupted by routine testing of asymptomatic children and teenagers.”A Government spokesperson said that mass testing in schools was reviewed as part of the Winter Plan, which concluded that it was a “valuable tool in minimising disruption” and should continue until the Christmas holidays.“We strongly encourage older students and staff to test twice a week and report the results to help reduce the spread of the virus and keep more students in the classroom, the very best place for them to learn,” a spokesman said.More from NewsBus services in crisis as drivers lured away to fill lorry vacanciesBritain faces ‘wave of terror attacks plotted by bedroom radicals’Sir David Amess murder suspect had considered killing other MPs, the  understandsFather of alleged jihadi suspected of killing Sir David Amess had himself faced Islamist threatsExclusive: Government to fund new nuclear power station as part of Net Zero driveWe have been in denial about the violent sickness in British societyMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"scientists prove mothers already knew glass milk best good nights","story":"A warm glass of milk has long been used by parents to settle their toddlers before bed. Now new research has suggested that it is not just an old wives’ tale and the bedtime drink really does help ensure a good night’s sleep.It is estimated that more than a third of Britons struggle to get to sleep. Sedatives such as benzodiazepines and zolpidem are commonly prescribed to treat insomnia, while sales of cannabis oils as a natural remedy have surged over the past year.However, many of these sedatives come with side-effects including memory problems, confusion and muscle weakness, as well as being highly addictive for some users.The medications work by activating the GABA receptor, a protein in the brain that suppresses nerve signalling and slows brain activity.In an attempt to find alternatives, scientists, funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, discovered that naturally sourced peptides in milk caused the same effect of drowsiness by binding the GABA receptor.Cow’s milk contains tryptophan and other peptides called casein tryptic hydrolysate (CTH) that relieve stress and encourage sleep. Together with a digestive enzyme called trypsin, they create a highly effective mixture of sleep-enhancing peptides.Within this milky mixture, scientists discovered that a specific peptide, known as α-casozepine, could be responsible for causing these effects.The team also identified other bioactive properties released from the CTH mixture when the milk was swallowed and digested.While observing the digestion process, the scientists virtually screened the peptides when they bound to the GABA receptor and the researchers watched for their ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.In tests upon mice, the researchers observed a specific natural peptide called YPVEPF, which increased the number of mice that fell asleep quickly by about 25 per cent, while improving their sleep duration by more than a staggering 400 per cent, compared to the control group.This promising peptide confirmed that other properties of the CTH mixture should be explored to enhance sleep using natural pathways instead of medicated ones, the scientists said.The study’s findings were published in the ACS’ Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry.Rhiannon Lambert, Harley Street nutritionist, said the findings showed the importance of diet and nutrition in producing the hormones that regulate our circadian rhythms and sleeping patterns.“A large amount of the happy hormone serotonin is produced in our gut – and much of it comes from our diets. Serotonin has an active role in the production of melatonin, which regulates our sleeping patterns,” she told the .“It’s derived from carbohydrates and an amino acid which forms a protein called tryptophan – so certain carbohydrates and tryptophan-rich foods absolutely have a role to play in promoting better sleep.“As a result, a lot of the time I find that people who are under-eating or who follow a low-carb or low-energy diet don’t sleep as well or find it harder to switch off. Many people just aren’t aware of the role food and gut health has to play in regulating sleep, and the fact that food – and carbohydrates in particular – can be a vital sleep aid.”More from NewsBus services in crisis as drivers lured away to fill lorry vacanciesBritain faces ‘wave of terror attacks plotted by bedroom radicals’Sir David Amess murder suspect had considered killing other MPs, the  understandsFather of alleged jihadi suspected of killing Sir David Amess had himself faced Islamist threatsExclusive: Government to fund new nuclear power station as part of Net Zero driveWe have been in denial about the violent sickness in British societyMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk must pound table return imperial measures northern ireland","story":"The Northern Ireland Protocol must allow pounds and ounces to be used in the province to prevent a “two-speed UK”, Tory Brexiteers have warned ahead of treaty talks with the EU.Imperial measurements will not be returning to Northern Ireland under government plans to slash EU red tape because of the Brexit deal to stop a hard Irish border.Traders in Britain will be able to sell exclusively in pounds and ounces as part of the bonfire of Brussels rules but Northern Irish shops and stalls will still have to display grams and kilograms. The Northern Ireland Protocol means the province follows some EU rules, including on measurements.Lord Frost begins negotiations with Brussels on Monday over the treaty, which grants Northern Ireland access to the Single Market but the UK argues disrupts trade with Britain.Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, put Lord Frost under pressure to secure changes that would prevent a “two-speed UK”, saying Northern Ireland must be able to make the same reforms as the rest of Britain.After Brexit, the Government ordered a review of inherited EU rules. The Taskforce on Innovation, Growth and Regulatory Reform (TIGRR) report calls for EU measurement rules to be repealed so that traders can sell exclusively in imperial again.The EU weights and measures directive, which requires the use of metric for the sale of fresh produce, came into force in 2000 in the UK. Traders could still use imperial but only alongside metric, which had to be as prominent.A group of small traders known as the “metric martyrs” were prosecuted for selling in imperial measures in the early 2000s. The legal battle that followed is credited with sowing the seeds of Brexit and the campaign to pardon the “metric martyrs” continues to this day.“We can see why the EU would want to insist on goods exported from Britain to the EU following their labelling rules,” said Warwick Cairns, from advocacy group the British Weights and Measures Association.“But when it comes to how people buy, sell and measure goods within the UK, we can’t see how it affects them or why they would expect to set the rules.”Sir Iain, an author of the TIGGR report, said: “All of the things we do here in the UK, on the GB side, must also be relevant to those who live in the United Kingdom on the Northern Ireland side.”“On that basis, the TIGRR report is aimed at the whole of the United Kingdom, and not just GB. And I made that point, obviously, to Lord Frost,” he said.Northern Irish farmers will be unable to benefit from British plans to introduce gene-editing in crops, because it is effectively banned in the EU and treated as genetically modified food.A more risk-based approach for chemicals regulation, nutraceutical supplements and animal feed nutrients would also be impossible, under the terms of the treaty, which was signed in 2019.Lord Frost will demand in the upcoming talks that Brussels allow the return of free movement of British pets in Northern Ireland, which is limited because the province follows EU animal health rules.The European Commission has offered to dramatically reduce Irish Sea border checks but nothing to curb onerous and expensive travel of dogs, cats and other pets.The UK wants the European Court of Justice stripped of its role in Northern Ireland but Brussels insists it is a prerequisite for Single Market access.More from NewsBus services in crisis as drivers lured away to fill lorry vacanciesBritain faces ‘wave of terror attacks plotted by bedroom radicals’Sir David Amess murder suspect had considered killing other MPs, the  understandsFather of alleged jihadi suspected of killing Sir David Amess had himself faced Islamist threatsExclusive: Government to fund new nuclear power station as part of Net Zero driveWe have been in denial about the violent sickness in British societyMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"want child get ahead britains strictest headteacher has harsh","story":"Her belief that “tough love” brings out the best in children has earned her a reputation as “Britain’s strictest headteacher”.The outspoken head of Michaela Community School in north London is notorious for her “no excuses” policy that means pupils can earn a detention for offences ranging from turning up to class without a ruler to breaching the silence policy by speaking in corridors.Now Katharine Birbalsingh has vowed to bring the same principles to social mobility after being appointed as the Government’s new tsar.In her first interview since being named as the new chairman of the Social Mobility Commission, she explained that one of her main priorities will be tackling bad parenting. “This idea that the state should look after your child’s schooling is ridiculous,” she told The Sunday . “Honestly, I think it’s ridiculous.”Ms Birbalsingh, 48, said she believed that parents failing to play an active role in their children’s education was one of the biggest obstacles to social mobility.“I have spent my life trying to improve schooling for children,” she said. “But all parents should be teaching their children all the time, from the moment when they are born to at least 16.“You know that your role as a parent is to feed them. You know that your role is to make sure they get bathed. You know that you need to hold their hand when they cross the street. You understand that instinctively. We need families to understand that part of their role as parents is to teach their child.”Ms Birbalsingh, who was made a CBE last year, rose to prominence at the Tory party conference in 2010 where she delivered an impassioned speech about how schools have been “blinded by Leftist ideology”, leading to a lack of discipline and bad behaviour.She earned a standing ovation for her scathing attack on a “culture of excuses” and the dumbing down of standards in schools, which she said had driven her from being a Marxist to voting Tory for the first time that year.But such was the furore sparked by her speech that shortly afterwards she parted ways with the south London academy where she was deputy head. With the backing of the then education secretary Michael Gove, she got to work setting up her own free school, which opened in 2014.Founded on strict disciplinary principles and a traditional teaching ethos, Ms Birbalsingh’s approach appeared to be vindicated when the first cohort of pupils’ GCSE results were four times the national average.Speaking to The Sunday  at her school in Brent, Ms Birbalsingh said everyone was so preoccupied with what was happening in the education system that the role of the family in education had been overlooked.“I think too often we concentrate too much on what the state is doing,” she said. “I think that focus on families is rarely made by the media, by anyone really. I think it’s because parenting is hard and everyone knows it and no one dares say that we all need to get better at parenting. But I think we do.”Not only were many parents unaware of the importance of reading to their children when they were toddlers, she explained, they were also in the dark about the detrimental effects of early exposure to technology.“These days, tech is seen as a bit of a babysitter and parents don’t realise the damage they are doing to their children,” Ms Birbalsingh said. “It is very hard for a child to like reading if the alternative is a phone. A phone has lots of colours, flashes, things jumping out at you - a book is flat and black and white, it cannot compete. By the time they’re older the child then doesn’t read.”Parents needed to be taught about the danger of allowing their children unsupervised access to the internet, she explained, adding that youngsters can easily be led astray by gang members or targeted by pedophiles.Unsurprisingly, she believes parents - like teachers - should be in a position of authority over their children, rather than trying to be their friends. “That doesn’t mean you don’t have a loving relationship, of course you do. But your child should admire and respect you, they shouldn’t think of you as their mate,” she said.“You need to be in charge. Sometimes parents end up going down the route of trying to be too friendly with their child. People think that in order to be a good parent you need to be really friendly, in order to be a good teacher you need to be super soft. In fact being a good teacher and a good parent means holding the line.”Ms Birbalsingh grew up in Canada before moving the UK with her family when she was 15. Her mother is Jamaican and father is Indo-Guyanese. She read French and Philosophy at Oxford and went on to teach French at a series of inner city London schools, writing about her experiences in an anonymous blog which was later turned into a book titled To Miss with Love.Another frustration for Ms Birbalsingh is the lack of options for children after they leave school other than university. She said some youngsters end up “wasting time” on useless degrees simply because “there is nowhere else to go”.“People tend to think there are lots of apprenticeships out there. Well, there just aren’t,” she said. “There is very little for children who wouldn’t go on to university. Not everyone needs to be able to go to university to be hugely successful. There are all kinds of jobs out there that you can do without going to university - there aren’t many routes for that and there ought to be.”Ms Birbalsingh intends to use her new role as social mobility tsar to encourage more schools to return to the traditional approach to teaching that she has pioneered. Pointing to a folder of laminated letters of gratitude from fellow headteachers, she said she already had around 600 visitors each year who come to Michaela Community School and see first hand how their approach works in practice.“Being strict just means keeping your standards high,” she explained, adding that handing out detentions for seemingly small transgressions - such as turning up to class without a pen - would benefit children in the long run. If teachers let these things slide, disadvantaged children would fall further and further behind. But if children can be taught good habits - such as turning up on time, dressing smartly and remembering the right equipment - they will grow into successful adults.“So our role as teachers is to support children in developing the kinds of habits that will make them into successful adults,” she said. “All these ideas, when it comes to schools, I would want to try and get happening across the country.”More from NewsBus services in crisis as drivers lured away to fill lorry vacanciesBritain faces ‘wave of terror attacks plotted by bedroom radicals’Sir David Amess murder suspect had considered killing other MPs, the  understandsFather of alleged jihadi suspected of killing Sir David Amess had himself faced Islamist threatsExclusive: Government to fund new nuclear power station as part of Net Zero driveWe have been in denial about the violent sickness in British societyMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"british muslims like detest islamist","story":"British Muslims like me detest Islamist extremists who prey on our communitiesThe overwhelming majority of British Muslims like me detest Islamist extremism and the vast majority are not Islamists, writes the founder of Faith MattersThe much-loved MP was stabbed  timesopinionByFiyaz Mughal:,  Oct | commentsThe suspect in the killing is -year-old Ali Harbi Ali who allegedly stabbed the much-loved MP  times then waited for the police to arrest or shoot him at the scene.

The overwhelming majority of British Muslims like me detest Islamist extremism. Islamists are dferent to Muslims. The former seek to politicise Islam, stamp its superiority into state structures, and place Sharia laws within the heart of institutions. Whereas Muslims seek to practise their faith on a personal basis and within the secular framework of our society. The vast majority of British Muslims are not Islamists.  Islamists should be viewed as preying like wolves on British Muslim communities, looking for the vulnerable and the marginalised, to inculcate them with their poisonous rhetoric. Sadly, in the past two to three years there has been little work done by this Government on tackling Islamist extremism. There has been no community-focused work tackling Islamist networks online or in small but vocal sections of Muslim communities. There needs to be a rapid and hard change of tack.

And those in Muslim communities who want to speak out against such extremism need to be actively supported. Time and time again, when brave British Muslims have spoken out against Islamism, they have been targeted and smeared by such networks. This cannot be allowed to continue. There are many British Muslims willing to stand up for our country’s values and its collective safety and security. The best message the Government can send to those who seek to harm and ide us, is there are Muslims willing to reclaim their faith from the twisted rhetoric of extremists.

It comes as the brutal murder of Sir David Amess, who was stabbed while at a constituency surgery at a church in Leigh-on-Sea on Friday, sparks fresh concern over the security of MPs. The killing follows the death of Jo Cox in . Speaking to Times Radio, Sir Lindsay said: We should also know who is putting up on social media. We should know the person behind it. These fake accounts, when we donapost know who they are. Offshore accounts being used as well, for threats and intimidation.  When somebody threatened to put a bomb under my car, just recently, that was done from an offshore account. He added: Recently, Iaposve had a couple of death threats. Maybe itaposs because Iaposve got a higher profile of being the Speaker. People then they take exception and they think the answer is that thereaposs others to inspire to murder me and the threats being out there. These things happen. But what it wonapost do, it wonapost stop me carrying out the job Iaposm elected to, whether thataposs the MP for Chorley and the Speaker of the House of Commons. He saidsocial media companies fail to take action on online hate, then MPs should legislate. He said: We have got to take it seriously. The companies have got one chance. If it was up to me and I was in charge of legislation, I would have done something. We are working very closely with them, some arenapost working as well as they should do and they need to get their act together, he added. Home Secretary Priti Patel did not rule out scrapping online anonymity in an interview with broadcasters on Sunday. She said: “I want us to look at everything.  “There is work taking place already. We have an Online Harms Bill that will come to Parliament, there is working taking place on it right now. “I’ve done a lot of work on social media s, mainly around encryption and areas of that nature. “But we can’t carry on like this. I spend too much time with communities who have been under attack, basically who have had all sorts of postings online and it is a struggle to get those posts taken down. “We want to make some big changes on that.” Since Sir David’s death, MPs have been sharing their day-to-day experience of the threats they face.Senior Labour MP Ms Nandy, asked whether she felt safe doing her job in her constituency, replied: “No, not reallyI’m honest.”The representative for Wigan said she backed the idea of MPs being able to ask for police protection at public meetings.  “I’m not sure that we can ever eliminate the risk but there are other things that can be done to reduce the risk,” the shadow foreign secretary told Trevor Phillips during an interview on Sky News. “I think the suggestion from the Speaker about ensuring that anyone who wants or needs security at surgeries is a good idea, not least because people often know, evenwe don’t advertise them, that they are happening, so they can become a magnet for people who want to come and cause trouble.” Andrew Rosindell, the Tory MP for Romford, said MPs were “a little bit” frightened after Friday’s tragic events and that he would recommend not publicising constituency surgeries online. Speaking to PA in Leigh-on-Sea, he said: “The problem with social media is that it can be picked up by anybody anywhere. A bad person can see it and can suddenly turn up and this is clearly what happened with David.” Sir David had publicised his surgery at the church on Twitter several days before the attack.

Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown said: We must say to Members of Parliament: be careful where you hold your constituency surgeries in a place that is protected but, at the same time,you need police protection that is going to be available. It need not be obtrusive, it need not be so obvious, but I think the protection has got to be made available now to Members of Parliament who feel that there is a risk to what they are doing. I think that will be introduced in the next few days.  The former Labour leader said that “the answer cannot be less democracy”. He went on: “The answer when you come across a terrorist incident is we donapost blink, we donapost shirk, we donapost flinch, we donapost show weakness and we stand up for what we believe. And, of course, we will increase the security that is available to Members of Parliament and councillors when theyaposre doing their surgeries, and that is something that must happen immediately. But itaposs true also to say that we must not allow our democracy to be diminished because a terrorist attack has occurred.

Britain is braced for a double whammy of fresh austerity measures and tax hikes, with the Institute for Fiscal Studies predicting the Treasury will cut billions of pounds from the budgets from Whitehall department budgets. But as Mr Sunak bids to take the UK economy out of deep freeze, his in-tray is bursting with urgent calls for new cash, from Boris Johnsonaposs numerous levelling up pledges to the UKaposs transition to zero carbon by . Here are all the problems the Chancellor is being asked to fix. The cost of living crisis Calls are intensying for the Chancellor to do more to support those on the lowest incomes as a perfect storm is brewing for poor households. The global gas crisis is expected to see energy bills shoot up, with charity National Energy Action predicting . million to . million more people pushed into fuel poverty.Add to those pressures the biggest tax burden since the war, a possible inflation shock pushing up food prices and the end of the £ uplt in Universal Credit.A Labour study of Office for National Statistics data found almost two million more people from working families were living in poverty - deemed to be below % of average household income after housing costs.Mr Sunak will be under pressure to boost the minimum wage and to extend help for those at the sharp end. Separately, Mr Sunak is expected to lt the public sector pay freeze in April, which has hit . million teachers, police and civil servants. Recovering from Covid The budget deficit high a peacetime high of % in the year to March and economists predict that a further six monthsapos funding furlough and other Covid restrictions mean an even heavier toll. In the first year of the pandemic, April  to , the Government borrowed £bn . While Mr Sunak is expected to say the Government will borrow less in the current year, April  to , the figure could still be more than £bn and economists believe the deficit may have grown to % of GDP.  The Treasury has already frozen income tax thresholds and announced a manesto-busting hike in National Insurance. Corporation tax will also rise from % to % from April , but Mr Sunak will be under pressure to do more to put the economy on a more sustainable footing. The IFS believes the budgets for education, local government and justice could be facing £bn cuts. But with a backlog of , crown court trials, a crisis in town hallsapos childrenaposs services and a generation of young people hit by lost learning during the pandemic, the Chancellor will struggle to justy more austerity. Or as the IFS put it: “These budgets were cut substantially in the s, and a further round of cuts would be dficult to reconcile with the government’s stated objectives – particularly around ‘levelling up. Backbench fury over foreign aid cuts Charities and MPs have already voiced anger that the Treasury has slashed overseas aid spending from .% to .% of national income. Mr Sunak has been told he could further damage Britainaposs international reputation after it emerged he plans to save cash by recycling aid money to help the worldaposs poorest. This would mean the Government saves some of a £bn windfall from the International Monetary Fund- intended to help developing countries cope with the Covid pandemic - by counting the cash as aid.  Most countries who get assets via the IMFaposs special drawing rightsuse them on top of pledged extra cash pumped into their planned foreign aid budget. But the Government has not denied reports the UK will reuse % of its allocation in order to save the Treasury up to £bn in the coming years. The move will leave backbenchers, including Conservatives, fuming. Levelling up Boris Johnson is expected to publish the Governmentaposs flagship Levelling Up White Paper soon.The drive is central to the Toriesapos appeal to so-called Red Wall voters but its definition is vague, apparently covering everything from empowering local government to transport cash and boosting public services.  Given the Northern Powerhouse Rail project, which would see new lines and upgrades connecting northern cities, would cost £bn alone, Mr Sunak is under a lot of pressure to splash the cash. The Chancellor was accused of a stitch-up over the £.bn Levelling Up Fund unveiled in March, which saw some deprived areas overlooked and cash overwhelmingly skewed toward Tory-held constituencies, so his spending review will be watched closely for signs of a similar pork barrel politics approach. High streets Research by the Local Data Company found that more than , chain stores closed on British high streets in the first six months of the year - an average of -a-day. Tory backbenchers, the CBI and Labour have been calling on the Chancellor to reform business rates to offer retailers more support in the wake of the pandemic, but the Government is delaying a review of the levies. Mr Sunak will be under pressure to do more. Climate change At his speech at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester earlier this month, the Chancellor did not mention climate change once. The UK will host the UN COP climate change summit in Glasgow later this month and the pressure is on the Government to show leadership.The UK has targets to cut CO  emissions by % by  and reach net zero by , but reports suggest Mr Sunak is holding back. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves, meanwhile, has committed Labour to providing an extra £ billion-a-year green investment. The Heating and Boiler strategy is expected to be announced, which will be aimed at making electricity cheaper and gas more expensive over the course of the next  years. Mr Johnson will ban the installation of new gas boilers after , with Brits handed subsidies of between £, and £, for electric heat pumps, and surcharges will be put on to polluting gas rather than electricity, which will push up gas bills by £. How much help Mr Sunak will offer Brits saddled with the cost of retrofitting, which is as high as £,, will be key.

That is the overwhelming verdict of his grieving constituents who one by one had turned to the politician in their hour of need. A former homeless couple, an elderly war heroine and a woman denied fertility treatment are among the many to have benefited from the slain MP’s unstinting desire to offer a hand. And today, in every corner of the Sir David’s constituency, normal folk lined up to heap praise on the member of Parliament who was never too busy to listen. One told how he helped one of the few British women to see active service in Germany during World War II obtain her war medals  years on.  Samantha McDonald, , contacted the MP five years ago after learning the elderly war heroine had been demobbed without ever receiving her promised and deserved accolades. Samantha said: “David got straight onto the local military representative for the British legion. “They worked together with armed forces to contact whoever they needed to, to get the medals. She received them within three months.  “He went out of his way to make it happen. She was over the moon.” The pensioner Sir David helped is now understood to be more than  years old and is living in a care home. Another woman revealed the MP had given her a chance to become a mother after he intervened in a fertility treatment battle with the NHS.  She wrote online: “Sir David stepped in at the most devastating time in my le. “This man changed my future forever. “I now have the chance to be a mum.” Volunteers at Saint Vincent’s Centre are considering naming their allotment after Sir David, who visited their premises just a fortnight ago. Former homeless couple Darren Bailey and Emma Hayter recalled how he took time to listen.  Darren, , told the MP he had spent two months living in a tent in Southend last winter, but had managed to gain support to find housing through the Saint Vincent de Paul Society, backed by Sir David. He said: “I told him how it had been really scary being on my own, and at times I didn’t want to be here any more as I had no purpose.  “He was a great listener. It really helped to have someone of his level encourage me and take the time to hear my story.” Emma, , who became homeless after a relationship broke down, but now lives with Darren in Southend, said Sir David inspired them to continue working towards “a positive future”. The charity’s director Dan Cauchi, , told how the MP stepped helped him get his pension sorted.  He added: “He was an amazing man. I bawled when I heard what happened to him.” The animal-loving MP previously backed the Sunday Mirror’s campaign to end cruel trophy hunting after we exposed how tourists could book holidays dedicated to killing animals. One local, Karla Syrett, said he would often stop to pet his constituents’ dogs. The -year-old was one of dozens to pay tribute outside the Belfairs Methodist Church where Sir David was attacked.  She wept as she laid flowers at the scene and told the Sunday Mirror: “He used to stop and stroke my shih tzu, Duke. “I talked to him about loads of stuff. He told me he was lucky to have such a nice family. “My husband worked on the paint section in Homebase and David used to chat when he came in to buy decorating stuff. He was such a lovely guy.”  Members or the Muslim community also left flowers. Ruhul Shamsuddim said: “For him to have his le cut short like this is so distressing. He was so kind to our community. He was always smiling.” Audrey Martin described her MP as “an absolute gentleman” who “dedicated his whole le to his constituents”. And proud socialist Bee Middlemast-Neal remembered him fondly, despite their political dferences.  She said: “On two occasions he successfully intervened on my behalf, when I had problems with the Department of Work and Pensions and Appeals and Tribunals service.” Abigail Mkhize remembered how the MP helped her with her Employment and Support Allowance benefit problems. She said: “Six years ago I was having chemotherapy and, as I was working as an agency nurse, I had problems with getting the help with ESA, so I went and saw him. “He said, ‘This is not right, you’ve been here for so long and you don’t deserve this – I will sort it out.’ And he did.” Ms Mkhize added: “He was the father of all nations, that’s how we can describe him. “Whether you were black, white, irrespective of where you come from, he gave that love, affection, kindness, caring.” Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON David AmessPoliticsSunday Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A note from cousins Moira and Pat left near the church where the -year-old was stabbed to death also read: “Can’t believe this has actually ­happened. Will always love you.” It came as it emerged Sir David had admitted his family “paid a big price” for his career in a clip filmed a decade before he died doing the job he loved. He made the comments in an amateur documentary filmed by then sixth-former Alex Bright for an A-level project in . Generously giving his time to the youngster’s film, Sir David revealed the “impact on one’s private le” of is “very, very tough indeed.”  The MP for Southend West in Essex, who was first elected in , said: “All I will say is, my family has paid a big price for me being a member of Parliament, that bears no doubt.” Sir David was stabbed multiple times at his constituency surgery on Friday and died at the scene. Last night, a -year-old British man believed to be of Somalian heritage, who was arrested at the scene, remained in police custody as officers searched two addresses in London. Counter-terrorism officials are examining possible links to jihadism.  The intelligence services also believe he may have been a “lone wolf” with no links to any major terrorist groups. Alex, who went on to work closely with Sir David as a councillor, was struck by the MP’s comments as he unearthed the clip exclusively for the Sunday People. “That quote really stood out – looking back on what has just happened, it’s evident this was true,” Alex said. “He was kind enough to let me interview him and talk about the role of an MP, what’s demanded of an MP and what’s expected of an MP. He really cared. This feels so surreal, like a nightmare. Sir David was such a nice and gentle person, you can’t fathom why anyone would do this.” In another part of the film, titled Are MPs Worth their Salary , Sir David observes: “I could have earned a great deal more money, had a private le, without what being a member of parliament entails. I’m not asking for any sympathy though, because it’s up to you whether you want to run for office.” PR professional Richard Hillgrove shared a Zoom call with Sir David just three minutes before he was stabbed. He said the MP had been “firing on all cylinders, full of buzz” as they discussed the Children’s Parliament, where Richard’s -year-old daughter Lola had been matched with Sir David. Their call ended at .pm, so Sir David could host his surgery at Belfairs Methodist Church in Leigh-on-Sea. At .pm, he was attacked Richard “was absolutely horried” when he heard what had happened”. He said: “Every minute that passed seemed like an hour. The longer it went, the more concerning it got. “I was honoured to have known him. He was such an inspiration, his engagement was incredible. He made sense of a crazy world.” This morning, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour Leader Keir Starmer made a joint visit to pay their respects at the church. They laid flowers outside the building and stood in a united moment of reflection. They were joined by Home Secretary Priti Patel, who has called for an ­immediate review of security measures for MPs in light ofthe tragedy.Speaking outside Southend Police Station, Ms Patel said it is “right and proper” that MPs are accessible to the public and stressed that politicians’ safety and an open democracy “can absolutely be balanced”. Her comments came as a spokesperson for the National Police Chiefs’ Council confirmed every parliamentarian will be contacted about their ­security by a chief constable as part of a review. As Sir David’s community reeled from his death, Muslim leaders in Southend slammed the attack as an “indefensible atrocity”, adding: “We condemn it in the strongest possible terms. A joint statement from representatives of local mosques continued: “This act was committed in the name of blind hatred and we look forward to the perpetrator being brought to justice.” Members or the Muslim community also left flowers at the scene. Ruhul Shamsuddim said: “He was so kind to our community. He was always smiling. We send our best ­wishes to his family.”  Former homeless couple Darren Bailey and Emma Hayter spoke of how Sir David took the time to listen to their stories two weeks ago. Recalling the meeting on September , Darren, , said: “I told him how it had been really scary being on my own, and at times I didn’t want to be here any more as I had no purpose. “He was a great listener. It really helped to have someone of his level encourage me.” Greg Myers, , a former host of Basildon Hospital Radio, said: “He was an incredibly supportive character... He would never say that anything was impossible.” Sir David, a Brexiteer and pro-le advocate, had represented Southend West since . Prior to that, he was MP for nearby Basildon from . The animal rights campaigner voted against fox hunting and championed awareness of endometriosis. A keen follower of Middle East affairs, he was a critic of the Iranian regime and chairman of the UK’s Qatar All Party Parliamentary Group. He was also a former member of Conservative Friends of Israel,which said it was “deeply saddened” by his death.For Alex, there is a “big sense of grief” at the loss of a man who, despite his many interests, worked tirelessly to make his constituents’ lives better. He said: “I saw him at church services, military parades, all sorts of things. What stood out was that no event was too small or insignicant, no matter what it was. Sir David made people feel important.” Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Priti PatelBoris JohnsonDavid AmessSunday People\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The former Prime Minister piled pressure on western nations to export surplus doses, as he blasted a lack of coordination in helping other countries inoculate populations against Covid-. A report due out tomorrow suggests about  million vaccines are sitting in Europe and the US which are unlikely to be used for months, he revealed. Mr Brown said the West has got to take action immediately to use these unused vaccines to save lives”. Many of them may go to waste - and that would be criminal - which could immediately be airlted out to those countries where the level of vaccination is so low that not even the nurses and doctors are protected - and certainly not the elderly and vulnerable,” the ex-Labour leader told Sky News. Boris Johnson promised at the G that he was going to vaccinate the whole world. He made this bold announcement that, by next year, everybody would be vaccinated who was an adult in the developing world as well as the developed world. But since then, so little has happened that we now face the possibility of every target being missed.”Experts have warned that leaving developing countries with far lower rates of vaccination than richer nations risked creating the conditions for mutant coronavirus strains - which could undermine the effectiveness of jabs.Challenged about his suggestion of criminality, Mr Brown said: “I was talking about neglect. “I do think that this is a lack of co-ordination. “IfPresident Biden, Boris Johnson, Ursula von der Leyen – the president of the European Union –Justin Trudeau came together, they would find that they had these unused vaccines that are not going to be used. “Even after all the boosters, there are excess vaccines that are not going to be used and they should get them out as quickly as possible.” He also suggested that Mr Johnson had missed a meeting, hosted by Mr Biden, to discuss getting vaccines sent to developing countries and said the PM should answer to the House of Commons about what role he played in that summit. A Downing Street source has said that the Prime Minister did miss his speaking slot, but said it was because the meeting was running late and he was due to attend a wreath-laying event at Arlington Cemetery in Washington DC.

I had to leave him there on the road. “My son has really struggled, he’s getting upset at school. He gets nightmares about it. “I want people to know what it was like. I know these stories come out all the time - it’s just people are not slowing down. There’s no care for other human beings. “It upsets me and it used to upset my dad - he would say ‘I donapost know why people have got to rush, they wouldn’t have tothey just left earlier.’” The single mum said her dad was helping her raise her two boys - now aged  and  - and was a “great role model”.

And since stepping down as a senior royal last year, sheaposs gone back to holding ious roles after she and Harry signed several multi-million dollar business deals. In fact, just this week, it was revealed that the couple were entering the world of finance and becoming impact partners and investors of a sustainable investment firm called Ethic. And previously, in , Meghan offered her advice to women wanting to get ahead in the workplace and her biggest tips for becoming a girl boss.  She told InStyle magazine: I think the biggest part of being a girl boss in the office, at home, or anywhere you go is just knowing your value As you get older, you become more comfortable in your skin and comfortable in saying aposnoapos to things. Rachel is an example of that on television, and as The Tig has grown as a brand, I’ve also learned that saying aposnoapos is just as valuable as saying aposyes.apos  Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. It’s something that, I think, comes with age and really having a sense of your self-worth. And then you make choices based on that. In the same interview, Meghan also gave her workplace fashion tips saying you should have a power piece in your wardrobe. She also advised staying out of office drama, explaining: I think in le and in the office, it’s best to stay out of the drama. You’ll be endlessly happier for it.  Harry and Meghan have signed a string of business deals since stepping down as senior royals and leaving the UK to head to Calornia.One is with Netflix, which they will work with to create content that informs but also gives hope.It is unknown exactly how much the deal is worth but it has been reported it could be worth  million. The couple has also signed a deal with Spoty, said to be worth £million to produce podcasts that promote “erse and inspiring voices” under the coupleaposs brand Archewell Audio. Meanwhile, last year, Meghan enlisted the help of her billionaire chat show friend Oprah Winfrey to help sell a vegan brand of coffee she had invested in. The Duchess backed the firm Clevr Blends – a start-up that makes instant oat-milk lattes – as she reportedly “begins to build a portfolio of startup investments”. However, the value of the deal is unknown.

Solihull Council told grieving Courtney Barnes, , that her sons Lorenzo and Jacksonaposs graves faced being disturbed when turf would be laid at Woodlands Cemetery.The local authority said the work would begin this autumn in accordance with cemetery regulations - just a year after the funeral, reports Birmingham Live. Courtney, from Chelmsley Wood, along with mum Tracy, , launched a petition after being given just four days notice to remove handmade decorations laid down for tots Lorenzo and Jackson.The -year-old, who on Friday miraculously gave birth to twin boys once again, had been told the family risked losing itemsthey were not removed in time.Mum Tracy claimed they would now only be allowed decorations on a small slab where the twinsapos headstone will eventually sit. When approached by BirminghamLive, Solihull Council apologised unreservedly for any distress caused and promised to give families more time to prepare.The original letter from the council, which has now been retracted, read: I am writing to advise you that your plot at Woodlands Cemetery will have new turf laid upon it this autumn in accordance with the cemetery regulations.The ground preparation will start on October ,  with the turfing commencing on October  which is scheduled to take  weeks to allow for any delays caused by the weather.To enable the grounds staff to carry out the works and to safeguard any decorations you have placed onto the grave mound, would you please remove these October  . Decorations can be placed upon the slabs, concrete or gravelled area at the head of the grave.  If you are not able to remove the decorations yourself the grounds staff will move smaller items to the head of the grave. Any grave frames in place will be disposed of as we do not have sufficient space to store them. Please be aware that we cannot take responsibility for any damage, loss or breakages soyou are concerned about the welfare of any item it is advisable that you remove this yourself. Once the turf has been laid items of any time will not be permitted on the grassed area of the grave. This includes frames surrounding the grave. Unfortunately we are not able to supply exact dates for when turf will be laid on a particular plot as the laying of the turf is dependent on weather conditions. Over the past two months, she said, they had worked hard to prepare a forever bed without knowing it would all be for nothing.  The grave currently includes fencing, stones, angels and a cross - all of which will have to be removedthey cannot fit on the narrow slab. She added: To me it is heart-breaking. We donapost want to go and destroy something that we have worked hard to do. Iaposve spent hours and hours in the garden painting things, everything on their grave is made by me. I didnapost buy anything from anyone, I made every item on there and it took me a long time. They are saying we can put things on the stone but the stone is about a foot wide. Tracey went on: Itaposs just passed  months since they were buried. Christmas is coming now. We usually put a little Christmas tree and stuff there. We canapost do anything. We canapost put anything on the grave.  The petition said families had been left mentally distressed - with Tracy and Courtney adding they just wanted to make the childrenaposs forever beds look beautul. This place brings me and other parents great comfort,the petition read. To be told they will remove [items]we do not is causing so much upset and pain. Have we not gone though enough  A spokesperson for Solihull Council said: “We would like to apologise unreservedly for the distress that this letter has caused. “The graves need to be turfed but we recognise that families need more time to prepare. We will give families at each cemetery four weeks in turn to move tributes and other items before work begins. “We anticipate this work will take approximately a month at each cemetery, subject to the weather.  “We would also like to reassure families that anything, apart from grave frames, that hasn’t been moved in time will be stored safely for a month and will be available for collection during that time. Unfortunately, we do not have the capacity to store grave frames. “We will be writing again to all the families who were mistakenly sent these letters to both apologise and outline the correct timeline and procedures.” Comment MORE ON TwinsArtChristmas treesFunerals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She says shes embarrassed to talk about the infestationThe house is infested with rats Image: birminghammailByKelly-Ann MillsReporterZoe Chamberlain:,  Oct Updated:,  Oct A mum claims says she has been living with the aposstench of deathapos due to a rat infestation after moving into her council house two years ago. The woman said had been made homeless at the age of  when her private landlord told her he wanted to sell her rented home. Birmingham City Council moved her into a hotel, then into a temporary accommodation apartment, where she remained for three years. The grandmother-of-three was eventually offered a permanent house near to Birmingham city centre, but was gutted to find she had inherited a rat problem.She told Birmingham Live she has pleaded with the council, been to the ombudsman and even instructed solicitors to try to resolve the issue but the vermin continues to plague her on a daily basis. She said: The pest control officers from the council have been out and have said thereaposs a dead rat trapped behind my kitchen cupboard where I keep all my food supplies, thataposs whataposs causing the stench. They also found a bag of rice bran that had been bitten open and there were droppings all around it, which shows that the rats are still active in my kitchen, eating my food. I broke down in tears whilst they were here. I feel like I donapost want to tell anyone about my rat problem because I think they wonapost want to come round again. Itaposs been two years of hell living here. I inherited these problems when I moved in. Initially, she ordered glue traps, poison and bait traps online and put them down herself but it didnapost solve the problem. She went to her local councillor, who advised her to check for cracks and holes and to fill them in, which she has done.  She added: I think thataposs just cemented the infestation in. I am now living with the stench of death and decomposition in my home. Iaposve found four or five dead rats. The council came and took one away and I put the others in the bin. One got into the radiator and when the council came for an inspection, it dropped down onto the floor. She added: Iaposm  and I live on my own. Itaposs a constant battle to keep the house clean when the rats are around all the time. Itaposs embarrassing. It makes you feel like you are being judged by society, you feel like people are wonderingyouaposve done something to cause it. But I think the rats are coming from underground outside the property. There are three sofas, bags and suitcases that have been dumped outside, thataposs not helping. The council has put poison down in the kitchen and the bathroom but the rats are still here. I just want it all to stop. I want to be rid of the rats completely. A Birmingham City Council spokesman said: As there is currently an ongoing legal case in respect of the issues raised, we therefore are not in a position to comment any further. However, it is worth emphasising that any tenant with a rat problem can request a free visit from a council pest control officer.

Grant and Sharon Jones, both , have moved to the Isle of Lewis, where they plan to run a smallholding. They described how a year and a half ago they were ready to make an offer on a croft down the road when a twist of fate made them bump into Tommy McLean. He was the nephew of the former owner of the plot they have bought - a fantastic, th century farm they plan to become modern crofters on. Talking to the Daily Record, Grant said: We were looking at crofts and we were about to put an offer on one down the road when we saw this guy coming up the road on his old  tractor and that was Tommy McLean, the nephew of the former owner.What are your thoughts on this  Let us know in the comments below  “We were speaking to him and we said, we’re looking to buy a croft and he said aposwell I have one that I’ll sell to youapos. If it wasn’t for bumping into him on his tractor, this might never have happened. Looking to integrate themselves into the local community and avoid contributing to the islandaposs housing shortage, theyaposre going to build their own home. The couple got married at an ancient stone circle, Calanais, on the island in  while living in Glasgow, then moved to Nairn, Highlands, before selling their house and moving to a more remote spot, the Daily Record reports. They are now living out of a caravan while they reuse and recycle the ruins of a derelict croft into a new road and a new eco-home. They also plan to fertilise the land with kelp to grow vegetables as well as rearing Hebridean sheep. Grant and Sharon, who is from Edinburgh, were keen not to have a detrimental impact on the quality of le of islanders - as a boom in second home ownership has made it harder for young people to afford properties.  Grant said: “Part of the reason we’re building a house is that we didn’t want to buy an existing home because there are lot of people coming to the islands and doing that and a lot of holiday lets. There is still a drain on the island in that respect and things are getting more expensive here, as they are everywhere.” Chairman of the Scottish Crofting Federation Donald MacKinnon, warned earlier this month that the market for crofts was “completely out of control”. The runaway price resulting as a result is in turn putting the plots of land well out of the reach of young people. Part of Grant and Sharon’s long-term plans include aspirations to eventually open their land up as a mentoring space for others to learn the ways of crofting - and they have just welcomed their first chickens. They are living in a caravan while contractors work on the croft, which dates back to  when it was first used as a smallholding. They hope to feed themselves in part with fruit and vegetables, including kale, potatoes, cabbage, leeks and onions, as well as eggs from their hens, grown on-site, in the manner of traditional crofters.  Grant worked on a dairy farm in his younger days in England and has experience growing grapes and passionfruit as well as sheep shearing from living in the Australian Outback. He was drawn to the “history and mystery” of the standing stones near their new home. Grant said: “It was fantastic, these stones dating back  years and no one really knowing why they are there or what they were there for. “Everyone has their theory but no one really knows. “The timeless landscape of Lewis always draws you back and the many moods on the island, the beautul light. “You can stand up at the stones there and look out southwest and the landscape pretty much hasn’t changed for hundreds of years.  “We always wanted to move and we spent a lot of time here but we never imagined that we would actually pluck up the courage to. The ruined house is being dismantled to make way for their new home, and relics from it are being recycled and reused - including an old tub where sheep were once gutted by former owner Donald McLean, whose family owned the croft from  until now. Stones from the old house have been used to build a road and beams from the roof will be made into planters for growing produce. A new, well-insulated,  square-metre, two-bedroom structure will house the couple and will be warmed by a source heat pump, an eco-friendly heating system. Grant said: “We’d been thinking of doing this for years, before adding they hope to get everything finished by spring timeweaposre lucky. “It’ll be done when it’s done. As regards the croft, that is going to take a long time. Vegetables are being grown in a polytunnel but without modern pesticides and the couple hope to be rearing native black Hebridean sheep by next year.

So rather than seeing  types of pasta you might see ten. “Or they might decide they don’t need nearly as much bottled water which is bulky and large in the shop. “It’s a tough and evolving situation and hard to say what will happen right now.  It comes after transport secretary Grant Shapps said the Government would relax cabotage rules on the number of deliveries EU drivers can make to an unlimited amount over a -day period. Ministers announced earlier this month that overseas drivers can take up six-month visas and plan to have the two-week unlimited deliveries scheme in place for December. Just  foreign drivers have so far been issued, the Government has said, as gaps remain in supermarkets and containers are left waiting at ports due to the staffing crisis.  But Rod McKenzie, managing director of policy and public affairs at the Road Haulage Association, accused the Government of pulling the lever marked ‘uncontrolled immigration’ as he claimed the scheme will lead to EU drivers undercutting UK workers. “The Government clearly wants to save Christmas and be seen to be saving Christmas, and extra drivers will clearly help Christmas deliveries, so, from a simple, populist point of view, you can see what they’re doing,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme. “But there are consequences for hardworking UK hauliers who are suffering under a weight of staff shortages, poor roadside facilities, ridiculous waiting times to load and unload, and this simply doesn’t help UK haulage.  “We don’t want cabotage to sabotage our industry.” He added RHA members were appalled at the emergency scheme, adding that ridiculous, pathetic, gobsmacked had been some of their more broadcastable comments. He said: “The Government has been talking about a high-wage, high-skill economy and not pulling the lever marked ‘uncontrolled immigration’, and to them this is exactly what it looks like. “Allowing overseas companies and drivers to come over for perhaps up to six months on a fortnightly basis to do unlimited work at low rates, undercutting UK hauliers. “So this is about taking work from British operators and drivers and giving it to Europeans who don’t pay tax here and pay peanuts to their drivers.” A Government source hit back at the intervention by the RHA, telling the Mirror: Itaposs a bit rich coming from the RHA which has consistently lobbied for theof cheap European drivers.

Donapost f*****g smile. The woman can be seen smiling, but it is not clear what she says in response. He can then be heard shouting at her again saying: Donapost taunt me or Iaposll knock you the f**k out you c***. The woman does not back down at his threats and refuses to cower, saying: If you call me a c*** Iaposll call you a c***. The man then walks towards the woman at speed and squares up to her, forcing her to back into the door of the carriage and press into the plastic ider. At this point a number of men who have been watching the incident unfold leap to their feet to pull him away from the woman and force him to leave the carriage.

The Met Office states: Sunny spells and showers for most areas at the start of this period with some places remaining dry. Feeling breezy at times especially along northern, eastern and southern coasts. Temperatures falling to below average for most, increasing the likelihood of snow over higher ground in the north. UK forecast for the next  days Today: Northern and central areas will have a mild day with low cloud and drizzle, perhaps some heavier rain at first. Northern Scotland will be brighter but cooler, and southern England and Wales will see warm sunshine once any fog clears. Tonight: Southern areas mostly fine. Clear spells leading to some fog especially for the southeast. Elsewhere, mostly cloudy with patchy drizzle and hill fog. Mild for most. Monday: Bright and fairly warm for a time in the southeast, but most areas cloudy with patchy rain and drizzle, and some hill fog especially later. Mild but breezier. Outlook for Tuesday to Thursday: Unsettled with showers or longer spells of rain for many areas, heaviest in the west. Very mild at night and warm by day at first but turning colder on Thursday.

The -year-old always saw the good in people, which meant she treated everyone she met like a friend.But it also made her vulnerable and prone to being hurt.In , Alexandria – known as Ally and originally from St Louis, Missouri – was studying for a marketing degree at the University of Mississippi, in the city of Oxford, USA.She also taught fitness classes on campus and had started a golf club. In her freshman year in , she had met business student Brandon Theesfeld. Although they had never officially been a couple, they had dated on and off over the years. Ally’s friends knew that she had fallen for Theesfeld, but that he didn’t treat her very well and could be emotionally abusive. She would show them texts of him blowing hot and cold with his affections – saying he loved her one minute and then denying it the next.Students said Theesfeld was arrogant and liked to brag about his family’s wealth. Some even called him a misogynist. He liked to play the field and wasn’t committed to Ally. But Ally had some news for him.In April, she messaged Theesfeld to say she thought she might be pregnant.She sent him a picture of an inconclusive home pregnancy test and told him they needed to talk.Theesfeld started to ignore her messages and rumours started to circulate around campus.Ally’s friends heard she might be pregnant and other students heard that Theesfeld wasn’t very happy about it and wanted her to have an abortion.He thought a baby would ruin his le and his future.Ally tearfully told her friends she didn’t want an abortion.She wanted Theesfeld to meet her but their communication was purely electronic for the next three months. Ally had no clue just how badly the potential baby news had gone down. Theesfeld’s internet history showed he was researching abortion pills and services. And he travelled home to Dallas, Texas, and posted a photo on social media of a Glock pistol his dad had bought. The caption read, “Finally taking my baby back to Oxford.”On  July, he started to research gun silencers, ammunition and tactical face masks. Theesfeld also looked into how serial killer Ted Bundy had lured his victims to their deaths.Occasionally, he would agree to meet Ally but cancel at the last minute or not show up. On  July, Ally was out for the evening. Surveillance footage captured her leaving a nightclub in Oxford before midnight.She walked along and was looking on her phone. After ing home, she slipped out again without her roommates noticing.Then, at around .am the next day, a routine police patrol discovered a body in the remote area around Sardis Lake – a popular place for students to hang out, about  miles from downtown Oxford. The body was identied as Ally.She had been shot eight times in the stomach and her purse was found dumped a mile away. Straight away, Theesfeld was the prime suspect. He had messaged Ally the night before, asking her to tell him when she was leaving the bar.His truck was seen heading to her home around am, then towards the lake. Gunshots were heard at around .am at the lake and Theesfeld’s phone placed him leaving the area  minutes later.The bullets used to kill Ally were also the type for the gun he’d bragged about on social media.On  July, Theesfeld was arrested at a petrol station in Tennessee and charged with capital murder.He had blood on his clothing and his gun was found in his truck. It was matched to the bullets that killed Ally.Investigators determined that he had lured Ally to meet him and killed her to stop her having the baby.Tragically, an autopsy found Ally had not been pregnant after all. Had she really believed she was  We will never know.Theesfeld was facing a death sentence on the capital murder charge, so he made a plea deal.This August, Theesfeld, , pleaded guilty to first-degree murder. The prosecution said he had been unhappy believing that Ally was pregnant. They spoke about a letter he had written to his family, which was found after his arrest.“I’m not a good person. It is not your fault,” he wrote. “Something in me just doesn’t work. I’ve always had terrible thoughts. I know I’m going to get caught.”The prosecution said Theesfeld had tried to pressure Ally into getting an abortion and he had messaged suggesting that he had “felt becoming a father at this point in his le would ruin his le”. So he had taken his gun and lured Ally to her death, driving her to the lake and repeatedly shooting her.Afterwards, he had even looked up “Sardis, Mississippi news” – presumably to seeher body had been found. The defence agreed after a mental evaluation that Theesfeld was sane and competent to face trial.But they claimed drugs and alcohol influenced his behaviour.In September this year, Theesfeld faced sentencing. He apologised to Ally’s family but had no explanation for his terrible crime.“My actions have forever changed your lives and my family’s lives,” he said.“I wish I could take it all back but I can’t. There is no excuse for my actions. I hope one day that you will find it in your hearts to forgive me.”Ally’s heartbroken mum, Cindy, had written a letter that was read out in court, describing Ally as “bright, compassionate, sweet and hardworking”.It went on, “I wish I could have kept her away from this evil, callous, scheming, ungrateful, sinister and violent and corrupt monster. He had every opportunity to do good in the world but he chose to do evil. “Brandon, you belong in jail each day for the rest of your le for the heinous act you committed to such a sweet soul in Ally. Every time your cell door slams shut, may it be a reminder for what you did and the le you took from us.”Theesfeld was sentenced to le in prison and will be eligible for parole when he is . The case that had rocked the university two years earlier had finally come to an end. Ally’s family, who had worn pink in her memory, asked the community to always remember her – to honour her the way she’d been committed to them.They want the way she lived her le to be remembered, not the terrible way she died.Ally had always tried to take the positive out of every situation and now her distraught family are trying their best to do the same.Comment MORE ON University of MississippiPregnancyLe sentenceMurder trialSerial killersCrimeAbortionSurveillance\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The house has been in Petersburg since the s, and although it appears to be made from plain old stone, it definitely isn’t. Weirdly, the house looks quite cosy and inviting, surrounded by pretty flowers and luscious green grass - but the walls tell a dferent story. The marble stones mark the grave sites of Union soldiers that died in the siege of Petersburg. They were used in an effort to recycle material from government-issued marble gravestones, which were used on the house and walkway. But what made the gravestones available  Well, during the Great Depression the government couldn’t pay for the upkeep of the gravestones. They were cut in half and the tops were placed flat on the ground, and the bottoms were auctioned off for  each. Oswald Young won these , gravestone halves and used them to build this very unique house, chimney and walkway.

Taking to Reddit, the woman shared her story - saying that she had wanted to honour her husband who died after the baby was conceived. She had promised to name the baby after him, but then when her son arrived she changed her mind as she felt like she was living in the past.Now her in-laws are furious and have called the woman aposdisrespectfulapos for not naming her son after her late husband, who passed away after contracting coronavirus.What do you think about the mumaposs decision  Let us know in the comments...Sharing her story anonymously, the woman said: I lost my husband due to covid when I was about three months pregnant. After he died my mother-in-law thought it would be a great idea to name the baby after himit was a boy. I agreed with it at the time because I was just so overwhelmed with emotion. She said it would be like heaposs still there in a way. When my son got here, even though I still wanted to honour him, Iaposm not so sure I wanted to name the baby after my husband. I feel like thataposs just sticking to the past, and that my baby should be his own person. So I gave him a dferent name on his birth certicate.The woman said that after her baby arrived, she announced his name on Facebook and soon after her mother-in-law was in contact.She continued: She called me a few hours later, asking why I had broken the promise. I told her my reasoning, and that I just wanted to move on in a healthy way. Now, she didnapost yell at me. But she did say how disrespectful it was to my husband to not include him in my sonaposs le in some way.

Thataposs when she raised her voice. Said she had been waiting all this time to meet her grandson and now she doesnapost even want to see him. I said that was fine and hung up. I do feel bad that I didnapost honour the promise but I feel like I donapost owe her or anyone anything. After sharing her story online, other Reddit users came forward to say that the woman had done nothing wrong and that it was her choice what she named her son - but could have handled the situation dferently. One said: I think your mother-in-law was wrong to try to influence your choice of name, and I think you were wrong not to let her know privately that you had changed your mind instead of letting her find out on Facebook. I hope she will change her mind about meeting her grandson, and when she does I hope you will be kind. She loved her baby just like you love yours. While a second user said: I feel like your husbandaposs family is trying to treat your son as a replacement for your dead husband and thataposs not fair to the child - but, she is also grieving. Not telling her about your decision to name him something dferent and telling her sheaposs aposjustapos your mother in law was probably extremely hurtful. Your child is also her sonaposs child. She doesnapost have the right to tell you what to name him, and you had no obligation to tell her about your decision, but it would have been the courteous thing to do so she wasnapost blindsided.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

You canapost really beat a chain which specialises in a good old Sunday dinner, can you  Or so you might think. According to TripAdvisor, many diners would disagree, with one particular branch of the restaurant chain taking a particular beating on the rating site.A Toby Carvery in Oldhamaposs Chadderton Park, in Greater Manchester, has been branded the worst place to eat ever, prompted the Manchester Evening Newsapos journalist Hana Kelly to go and check it out for herself.Food awful service even worse, worse place to eat ever, one review reads, while another diner wrote: Donapost have the Yorkshire puddings unless you want to lose a tooth or two. However, others tell of vastly dferent experiences as one reviewer writes: Amazing food, nice and warm, good service  good options. The server was fast and the food was cheap, but what did Hana think  Hereaposs her review.  What’s cooking  A delicious plate, full to bursting with fluffy yet crunchy roast potatoes, a Yorkshire pudding so crisp and rosy, it almost seems a shame to coat it in a thick, rich gravy. The veg should have a crunch, a sweet flavour to counteract the savoury deliciousness of the meat and the mix of trimmings, from stuffing to sauces should capture your senses before you’ve even taken a bite. At this Toby’s, the offering hit maybe % of this description. The Yorkshire pudding: truly faultless. It was golden with a crunch to match autumn leaves. The gravy: thick, flavourful, available in both meatysaurus and vegetarian options. The rest: Eh, acceptable. The turkey was dry. The kind of dry that meant when the carver was carving it, it cut not in slices but in small, frayed chunks like sawdust. The potatoes, in roasted form, were crisp on the outside and that’s that, no fluff, not much flavour. Meanwhile in mashed form, they were sweet and goopy. The vegetables were acceptable, certainly nothing worthy of review.  Are you being served  The enjoyment of post-Covid self service was definitely something missed by the patrons of the Chadderton Park Toby Carvery. One reviewer, who left one star on Tripadvisor, described the lack of self service during the pandemic as ‘not enjoyable at all’. They said: “The carvers throw it all on a plate on top of each other so it looks like a dogaposs dinner. But low and behold, self serve has ed, once your meat and Yorkshire are safely home on your plate, you can choose your own. A smiley waiter leads you to a table, takes your drink order and lets you know you may head for the carvery when ready. I sat for a few minutes contemplating what it meant to be ready before realising I just needed to get my dinner. However, this doesn’t mean there isn’t still confusion over the systems. One couple waited at their table for over  minutes wonderingthey’d been forgotten before flagging down a waiter and discovering they were meant to serve themselves. What’s the damage  If there’s one thing for certain, for a full roast the price is right. At a wonderfully affordable £., it is a good deal and great value for money. The verdict  As a Toby Carvery first timer, the meal was sadly disappointing. The staff were polite and relaxed, explaining the process, and serving drinks and the bill quickly. The atmosphere was warm and friendly, with laughter heard from many tables and tasty gravy smells wafting all throughout the pub. The queue at the carvery station was non-existent, meaning my food was still piping hot back at the table. There was ample parking, but the pothole ridden car park could have destroyed a caraposs suspension. But for a pub that sells itself on its roast, I’ve definitely cooked better.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

But, itaposs fair to say that couples probably should think about discussing their separate and joint spending before making the commitment of tying the knot. In the not-too-distant past, it wasnapost uncommon for the man of the house to control the spending, given that in many circumstances, he would be the one to go out and earn the money while the woman of the house was considered the aposhomemakerapos.

The man, known only as aposthe Mayorapos, has over , tapes in his home, many of which are extremely rare as they were withdrawn because ofissues. The aposirreplaceableapos collection stretches from floor to ceiling in his house in Liverpool, and one room is a faithful recreation of an old Blockbusters rental store, complete with illuminated sign. The Mayor has so many videos that heaposs now running out of space, but he says heaposll never give up his collection as finding rare tapes is his hobby and passion. What do you think about the Mayoraposs collection  Let us know in the commentsHe said: Iaposm always building it and building it. Itaposs a full-time occupation and I travel all over the country to get video collections. Iaposve also found some in a skip in Watford. There will always be a gem in there, a catalogue filler. I first started collecting in  when I went to a car boot sale. I wanted to own my video shop one day but then DVDs came out and ruined that idea.  I always buy ex-rental tapes because they were built to last longer on high-grade tape and the quality doesnapost degrade, unlike sell-thru retail videos. They only last around  plays and the quality in picture and sound would degrade, and they arenapost worth anything. When videos were dying out I still continued to collect ex-rental VHS tapes. I couldnapost see the point in buying films on DVD that I already owned and have to pay yet more money. They are arranged by date in catalogue order number. Even though there are so many, I can find any title pretty much instantly.  Many of the Mayoraposs videos are highly sought-after pre-certs - referring to the period in the early days of VHS tape when they did not require a certicate from the British Board of Film Classication.This all changed following the video nasty moral panic of the early s, when the market was flooded by cheaply made, gory horror films which anyone could buy or rent. Later, videos had to be given a certicate in the same way that cinema releases were.He has multiple copies of particular titles - such as Alien and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre - as the packaging was dferent each time it was released, depending on whether it was a apospre-certapos or apospost-certapos copy. The Mayor said: The collection as a whole is irreplaceable, and must be worth hundreds of thousands of pounds. Iaposm so glad that I never replaced my collection with DVDs because theyaposre worth nothing these days and yet again another format came out to replace DVD anyway. What gets me is how people still keep replacing their films with so-called better formats and keep wasting money, then a new format will come out of the same film they upgraded and off they go upgrading again. Absolutely mind-boggling! For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newslettershere.Everybody had VHS back in the day and itaposs made a huge comeback. My collection has grown massively in recent years, through buying ious job lots on eBay and other sources.I have no idea how many I actually own as it would be very hard to count, but there are absolutely thousands here and it must be one of the biggest in the country. But now Iaposm running out of room. I need to get my museum off the ground. Itaposs a fun passion, keeps me entertained and I donapost think I could ever sell them. I only sell my swaps but thataposs it. Every tape that Iaposve not got that comes in goes straight into the collection. If youaposre thinking of collecting tapes then be sure to only buy ex-rental as the retail tapes will near enough be unwatchable over time. If you have a collection of tapes make sure theyaposre not stored in a damp place as they can become mouldy, so avoid the garage or garden shed.Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

In the wake of the summer space race between Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, the world’s richest men are taking on a new challenge – immortality. Amazon boss Bezos, , is one of the main backers of Altos Labs, which has raised £million and just opened a new laboratory in Cambridge. But Bezos, worth £billion, is far from being the only one taking on the grim reaper. Google co-founder Sergey Brin, , has invested more than £million in a “longevity lab” called Calico.And Paypal founder Peter Thiel, , has pledged £million to the similarly-tasked SENS Research Foundation.  Meanwhile Russian tech mogul Yuri Milner,  – worth around £billion – has handed grants worth millions of pounds to the science of anti-ageing. Longevity expert Michael Rae, , from Calornia’s Bay Area, tells the Sunday People that the science of living forever is making huge leaps forward. As well as being backed by Thiel, his SENS group has also had meetings with Bezos. And with big-money backing, he is optimistic the secret to eternal le can be cracked by . Because the technology is so expensive to develop, it will be available only to the rich at first.  But scientists believe that once it is rolled out to the general population, le expectancy could be raised to around , years. They claim the only causes of death will then be bad luck – and stupid mistakes. Rae revealed: “Bezos is taking a gamble on a technology that is harder to realise – but it’s going to have a really big payoffthey can make it work. “Reprogramming technology is exciting because,we can wind the clock back and make our cells youthful again, that will help to finally break the link between age and death.  “Will this happen in five years or  years  Absolutely not. “But in a quarter of a century, quite possibly yes. “Especially now that there has been this large infusion of money and Bezos has so many talented scientists working for him.” Here, we look at the five main theories on achieving immortality – and how soon the phrase “within our letime” will cease to have any meaning. Stopping bodies ageing They say that death and taxes are the two things you cannot avoid. But the SENS Research Foundation, based in Mountain View, Calornia, believes ageing is a disease that can be tackled like any other. Its goal is to “comprehensively repair the damage that builds up in our bodies over time”.  One research strand is askingbackup copies of cells can be created to replace maling ones. The new cells would be implanted in our flesh so they can take over when our system starts to degrade. This would mean we can refurbish our bodies time and again – like we replace faulty chips in a computer. Michael Rae, , a science writer at the foundation, explains: “The Big Kahuna is when we get to the point that your le expectancy is no longer aof your age. “Right now, every year you live, you’re closer to your doom. Once you take away ageing, it becomes open-ended. That doesn’t mean you’re immortal – you can still be murdered or hit by a catastrophic infection like Ebola, or die in a plane crash. “But you are no longer going to be more vulnerable to disease and death. “At that point,you do the maths on how unlikely it is to die, it gives a le expectancy of about , years. “You can still die the next day, or live to , years. It becomes about what happens in your le.” Cryogenics and articial intelligence Some scientists believe that in the future a computer will store our DNA code and will send out warnings when we need gene therapy – warding off fatal diseases by removing genetic mutations. Implanted microchips would also alert doctors to the ageing of our cells. They even hope to back up our personalities online so thatwe die we could be downloaded to a robot or hologram, keeping us going well beyond our -year le expectancy.  Russian billionaire Dmitry Itskov is putting his money behind this idea and has founded a non-profit called the  Initiative to fund the research. Another aspect of the immortality industry – said to be worth £bn worldwide – is cryogenic freezing, storing corpses in liquid nitrogen at a temperature of -°C. Since , Alcor in Arizona has preserved  clients, including  Brits, at £, each… with the hope of bringing them back to le when technology advances enough. Anti-ageing drugs Longevity expert Michael Rae is hopeful that death from serious disease will plummet in the next decade as anti-ageing drugs currently in development hit the market. He said: “One rejuvenation technology I suspect is going to be coming pretty quickly, in the next  years, is with drugs called senolytics. “There are certain cells that stop reproducing themselves and become metabolically abnormal. “They start excreting all kinds of inflammatory factors that make them more prone to becoming cancerous. “Senolytic drugs selectively kill those cells – there’s evidence that the body becomes rejuvenated in a wide iety of ways when you use them. “These drugs should be effective in eliminating a number of age-related diseases, which is a big step forward. “The immune system can already remove these damaged cells – but it seems it either falls apart as we age or it’s just incomplete. “We’re working on a range of ways to make it easier for your immune system to clear those cells out. “One thing we’re looking at to do this is by using engineered cells that will do the job for you.” Are there any ethical concerns  It is hard to imagine a world where people live to , years old. The Earth is overpopulated already and headed for an environmental disaster. So what effect would a population explosion have, as living conditions become even more cramped and we consume record amounts of meat and fuel  Michael Rae bats aside these concerns.  He is more worried about the thousands who die every day from age-related issues. And he pleads for world leaders – and the public – to start donating to research centres such as SENS. He said: “The big concern I have about the research is that it’s not going fast enough because it’s not being funded adequately. “We’re not going half as fast as I’d like – every day that we’re delayed, we have another , people dead from this plague of ageing. “I watched my grandparents die. My grandfather was living on oxygen and had a hard time walking around by the time he passed. “My grandmother was almost blind and needed help getting out of bed. “I’ve done a iety of things to keep myself healthy, but I’m conscious the science is not developing as quickly as I would want. “Beyond that, yes there are concerns. If we unshackle people from the ageing process, the population is going to increase over time and that could pose certain ecological constraints.  “It’s certainly going to pose a need for rethinking things like retirement ages and pension plans – and the way we structure our lives around ageing and dying. “But one has to maintain a sense of proportion. These things have technical fixes. “We have to be better about using resources on all kinds of fronts because the world is already headed for an environmental disaster. “Are we really saying the solution to things like our ecological problems is that people have to keep dying of cancer and heart attacks ” Biological reprogramming technology Amazon boss Jeff Bezos is reported to be one of the main backers of Altos Labs, a collection of state-of-the-art research centres in Cambridge, Japan and Calornia headed by US scientist and cancer expert Richard Klausner. The scientists here are using £million of funding to develop something known as “biological reprogramming technology”. This will allow the cells in our body to be rejuvenated, turning back the clock and reversing the ageing process. There is also hope that the research will bring an end to le-changing conditions such as Parkinson’s, heart disease and cancer – as our cells will no longer degenerate and mutate. One new scientist on the team, Spaniard Manuel Serrano, says he was offered five times his salary to move to Cambridge to work for Altos Labs, showing the firm is recruiting the best and brightest in the business. Expert Michael Rae told us: “Reprogramming technology is taking a cell that has accumulated age-related changes that are dysal and winding the clock back. “You remove some of those abnormal changes, so it behaves like a youthful cell. “Once you’ve done that it starts ageing again. So eventually you will have to wind it back again and again – but that’s fine as long as you keep up with it. “In some ways that is even more exciting becauseyou are  years old and you can wind the clock back, you’ve done a lot for that person. “Bezos is in his s – so he has made a bet that’s going to pay out at a very good time for him.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON GooglePaypal Inc.Silicon Valley PLCScientic LaboratoriesElon MuskMichael RaeJeff BezosRichard BransonImmune systemLe expectancyBillionairesSunday People\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

especially when it comes to the impact of proposed sites on traditional fishing grounds # poor site maintenance and monitoring which can lead to instances of vessel entanglement and also the environmental impact of the sites on both commercial and non-commercial species.The group believes that while the sector has made many advances over the past decade, increased transparency and oversight are needed to ensure the aquaculture sector can better co-exist with the fishing industry.The initial aim of the group would be to ensure that there is a proper analysis of localised fishing and follow up with clear and sensible communication between the two sectors to ensure that with expansion does not come conflict.It is a timeous idea, which will hopefully reassure fishermen that they will not simply be displaced by fish farming but will be respected for their own produce.The group will cement a policy to assist the fishing industry deal realistically with the fish farming industry and the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation.Simon Macdonald, chair RIFG Aquaculture Work GroupSir,NFU Scotland is calling on the UK Government to address the nation’s growing labour crisis, which is undermining all parts of the food and drink supply chain, leading to signicant losses on some Scottish farms and resulting in a growing number of empty shop shelves.Last week#s #BackBritishFarmingDay on September  came as a UK Government announcement of a free trade #agreement in principle# between the UK and New Zealand is believed to be imminent.Having agreed in June to provide unfettered access in the future to Australia, the cumulative impact of another deal with a major exporting nation has huge signicance for Scottish farmers and crofters.With so much to celebrate about the quality and standards of our food and drink, #BackBritishFarmingDay was a fantastic opportunity to thank the nation for their incredible support throughout Brexit and Covid-.NFU Scotland, both independently and in conjunction with the Scottish food and drink industry, has written several times to UK Government calling for measures that address the shortfall in both seasonal and permanent staff.Should it fail to do so, I have absolutely no doubt that the situation will deteriorate further.It is galling to hear that the UK Government is on the verge of signing up to another free trade deal that will permit a growing level of imports while delivering very little to our food and drink sector in .The blunt fact is that neither deal has been afforded any kind of proper parliamentary scrutiny as the government’s promised Statutory Trade and Agriculture Commission has yet to be established.Safeguards against market disruption are also promised, but the cumulative impact of these deals will be profound for UK farming.If handled badly, these may make it impossible for some of our family farming businesses to continue to compete with high levels of low-cost imports produced to standards that would not be allowed here.Martin Kennedy, president, NFU ScotlandSir,National audits of diabetic services have shown that only around  per cent of people with type one or two diabetes have nine key annual checks to help prevent long-term diabetic complications.The pandemic has made this situation dficult because many routine checks and face-to-face appointments have not been available.The InDependent Diabetes Trusthas published a free new booklet which explains the nine key tests.It helps people look after their health by ensuring that they know what checks they need from health professionals.Get your copy of Diabetes care #

Yet we often treat them in a dismissive way.Let#s think about some insects.Take the bluebottle. How often has it outwitted us with its amazing flight paths, ducking and ing to avoid our threatening gestures.While we have developed some of the most sophisticated flying machines the world has known, none can match the bluebottle in its agility.We have mentioned pollination. What insect is more important than the bee as it goes about its business from flower to flower ensuring that the plants will produce seed for another year and giving us honey as a product of its labours.How beautul too are its colours and the structure of its body – a remarkable little insect.Then there is the humble moth and its gravity-defying antics walking across ceilings. It has a very fragile body but in its short le can nevertheless act out its own acrobatic skill in an amazing performance.Or we may think of the spider and the beauty of its web, perhaps seen on a frosty winter morning. A true work of art woven with such delicacy.In the bible we read this: #Go watch the ants, you lazy person. Watch what they do and be wise. Ants have no commander, no leader or ruler, but they store up food in the summer and gather their supplies at harvest.# From this we can learn four things helpful to living: be diligent and hard-working have an #I can do it# attitude plan ahead remember teamwork is important."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader october 1 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowIt#s a strange one, the fuel situation.There seems to be no one reason for it but, for whatever reason, a sort of mass hysteria seems to have taken hold where in the UK.

We are exceptionally grateful for their continued support and determined to repay that commitment on the pitch whist working closely with them in the wider Borders community.ldquoDuring lockdown we were able to continue to offer rugby activities for the younger children, and during April we were able to support a new Try It Out campaign aimed at children that wouldnrsquot typically have access to rugby or sporting activities because of social or economic barriers. We feel very strongly that the ability to pay shouldnrsquot prevent access to sport.ldquoParents and carers were offered the option to pay what they could, or in some cases nothing at all. Over  boys and girls joined in the fun sessions at the Melrose pitches, and the majority registered to stay on until the end of the summer season. The lting of restrictions has allowed the Southern Knights to launch their buddy scheme aligning some of their semi-professional players to the younger players to help encourage and develop their skills and to inspire children to play to the best of their ability.ldquoThis inclusive ethos is shared by CGI and the award winning Inspire Learning Programme developed in partnership with Scottish Borders Council for pupils from primary four to sixth year in high school throughout the area.ldquoThis uses iPads and an array of other tools to support learning and aims to benefit all children and teachers by raising attainment, support equity and inclusion, and to work towards preparing young people for a digital future. We are keen to continue to support these initiatives in conjunction with CGI over the coming months and years.Dominic Taddei, Chair of Southern Knights Super Board said: ldquoWe are delighted to continue to work a further term with our headline sponsor CGI. Their support through very dficult times has been phenomenal and we look forward to working with them as we get ready to approach the finals day, and to now have the ability to offer a wider audience for FOSROC Super with the fantastic news that was released by Scottish Rugby on rd June  that every Super Sunday fixture has been televised live on free-to-air television by new broadcast partner, FreeSports. The FOSROC Super finals weekend will take place on the weekend of    October, and we look forward to showcasing CGI as our headline sponsor at the finals event.The continuing partnership between CGI and the Southern Knights is not only a relationship supporting sport in the Scottish Borders but also Southern Knights players and coaches are working closely with CGI on community-based initiatives in Borders schools, delivering motivational and inspirational videos for the pupils. CGI employees will also benefit from the relationship with the option to join in fitness sessions at the Greenyards and receiving motivational and leadership messages from the coaches."},{"url":null,"title":"minor-change-clovenfords-consistency-boundary-review","story":"A BORDERS MP has commented on the proposed constituency boundary changes which could come into force as part of the  Review.The Boundary Commission of Scotland published its proposals yesterdaywhich outlined new boundary lines for UK constituencies in Scotland.As part of the review there has been a \"minor change\" to Clovenfords and Caddonfoot in the Berwickshire, Roxburgh, and Selkirk constituency ndash as part of the  review they will be brought into the Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale constituency.:Two cars involved in lsquocollisionrsquo on road near Borders town, according to policeBerwickshire, Roxburgh, and Selkirk MP John Lamont, who represents the Conservatives, said: \"I have always been of the view that during any boundary review the Borders communities within the existing constituency of Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk should remain in one constituency.\"Although there are minor changes around Clovenfords, I am pleased to see that principle recognised in the Commissions initial proposals.\"Under this review, Berwickshire, Roxburgh, and Selkirk will have an electorate of ,, and Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale will have an electorate of ,.:Committee \"chuffed\" with turnout as Borders community shop officially opensThere will now be an eight-week-long consultation process for constituents to have their say on the proposed boundary changes across Scotlands  constituencies.Mr Lamont added: ldquoAs we now enter an eight week consultation period, I would encourage local residents to take part in the consultation as it is vital that views from Borderers are heard.\"I look forward to the outcome of this process.To view the existing and proposed boundaries, and take part in the consultation, visit: www.bcomm-scotland.independent.gov.uk "},{"url":null,"title":"jedburgh-man-admitted-shoplifting-offence-given-unpaid-work","story":"A BORDERS man who admitted theft by shoplting has been ordered to carry out  hours of unpaid work at Selkirk Sherf Court.Forty-six-year-old Paul Crowe, of Jedburgh, pleaded guilty to stealing pound worth of items.The items were fully recovered."},{"url":null,"title":"hawick-man-drove-almost-four-times-legal-alcohol-limit","story":"A BORDERS man who drove while almost four times the legal alcohol limit has been banned from the road for two years.Fty-six-year-old Allan Knox, of Hawicks Twirlees Terrace, pleaded guilty to the offence which happened in Mart Street, Hawick, on March .Joanne Waller, prosecuting, told Jedburgh Sherf Court that two witnesses saw the accused in Morrisons car park walking towards them in possession of a bottle of wine.They thought he appeared unsteady on his feet and askedhe was drunk or unwell but he replied he was depressed and was slurring his words.He then drove off in towards Linden Crescent and was followed by the witnesses.Ms Waller said Knox ed to the car park and was found by the police asleep in his vehicle with the keys in the ignition.He was arrested and taken to Hawick Police Station where he was cautioned and charged .Knox initially told officers he had not been driven but had earlier gone to Morrisons for a bottle of wine.He pleaded guilty to a charge of driving with a breath alcohol count of  microgrammes ndash the legal limit being .Defence lawyer Ross Dow said his client had been struggling with depression following the end of his -year marriage.Sherf Valerie Johnston noted a previous conviction for drink driving and said as a result the minimumof ban was two years.In addition he was fined pound, reduced from pound due to the guilty plea, and a pound Victim Surcharge was imposed."},{"url":null,"title":"first-class-stamp-honours-first-class-player","story":"BORDERS rugby legend Roy Laidlaw is to feature in a new set of stamps issued by the Royal Mail.The eight stamps in the set mark the th anniversary of the first international rugby match, staged between Scotland and England at Raeburn Place in Edinburgh in .Scrum-half Laidlaw, whose two first-half tries against Ireland at Lansdowne Road in Dublin, in , were instrumental in Scotland winning their first Triple Crown since , will feature.The former Jed-Forest star, who was capped -times for his country, recounted: ldquoI remember Ireland won the toss and decided to play against the wind in the first-half.

forest, of course, but a very small strip of ancient woodland, east of Innerwick, that clings to the steep slopes of the glen by Crowhill. The woodland is a nature reserve currently managed by the Scottish Wildle Trust.The upper path takes you to Innerwick Castle. This path is narrow in places, although quite well trodden so easy to follow.But it is sided by a steep decline into the gorge that demands you take care when walking. The castle, built in the th century, is perched dramatically atop a sandstone outcrop looking over the glen. It is picturesque now but a crumbling ruin in such a precarious condition that itrsquos not recommended to venture inside.I wrote of its history on this page over seven years ago, and will touch on it again here, but the purpose of this visit was mainly to explore the gorge below the castle, which Irsquod never managed to do.Irsquoll give a warning here too: the lower path that takes you closer to the burn, although marked, doesnrsquot seem to be maintained and is in parts very muddy and slippery. It can become an adventure rather than a woodland walk. But thatrsquos what we wanted.We were immersed in native woodland as we descended, embraced by ash and oak trees. The burn ran with some confidence through the glen, carrying the rainfall of previous days. Touches of autumn were everywhere, yet the summer canopy was still intact. It was a perfect combination.As the path heads deeper up the glen, the trunk of a massive fallen tree make it an obstacle course, but also an opportunity to sit and just take in the beauty of the place and soak up the birdsong.In those moments, it was possible to forget that we were, in fact, in a landscape dominated by agriculture and open fields. The steep sides of the gorge hide the fact that the wood is just a very narrow strip. The eye is deceived, the imagination lit and the senses lted.I was determined to make it to the water. The short scramble down to the burn from the path was a drama of mud.I know, Irsquom not selling this place so well, am I, but it was the challenge to reach the burn that made it feel so remote and wild once we got there.Then one of my kids, in between complaining about muddy shoes, said something that lit up the day for me.ldquoWow, you know, it almost feels like we are in a world of fairytale make believe, you know because we are in a wood that feels like itrsquos mysterious and magical at the same time.She summed up my feelings as I sat by the burn, listening to the water tumble over the rocks.I really wanted to walk up the burn to the point below the castle.Wersquod earlier peered down at the burn from the base of the rock on which the castle is built at least a ft-fall, I reckoned.It was far too dangerous to descend at that point, although I had wanted to it was where a Scots soldier from the castle leapt for his le in  when the castle was besieged by English hakbutters, an early kind of musketeer.He was desperate his comrades had been picked off by the gunfire, so he took the chance to escape.Miraculously, he survived the initial fall and was allowed to run to safety. Sadly, he made the fatal decision to run upstream, towards Thornton Castle, where he was seen and shot by a dferent group of English soldiers who knew nothing of his daring feat.The incident was recorded by an English eyewitness, but we have no name for the man who met his end so tragically in this gorge ndash just another nameless victim of a brutal war that became known later as the lsquoRough Wooingrsquo.Later, the castle was used as a base by moss troopers in  in their attacks on Cromwellrsquos supply route, but thatrsquos another story.The melancholy of the glenrsquos history didnrsquot diminish its beauty for me and I made my way carefully along the burn, jumping from stone to stone, getting my boots muddy and soaked in the process. It really was a magical experience in which my inner child felt free.However, I had a dferent kind of gunfire to contend with as I ventured upstream. Irsquod insisted my kids stay in a safer place and my we Kate was happy to be with them and keep her feet dry. But the children showered me with a volley of distant shouts and yells that they wanted to come too, which I felt would have been too hazardous for the youngest.So I was compelled to abandon my exploration in case they broke ranks you see, they donrsquot always do as they are told, especially when their dad is doing something they want to experience as well!But I will I can find the time in the winter, with perhaps just one of the kids: my own inner child."},{"url":null,"title":"public-say-future-20mph-speed-limits-east-lothian","story":"Speed limits throughout towns and villages ndash

Major supermarkets are now committing to targets around food waste, sustainable food production and plastics. But more progress is needed in coming up with new ways of producing and consuming foodwe are to feed our everndashgrowing population in a sustainable way.As part of Greenbankrsquos research into sustainable food production back in , we found that although % of people wanted to buy local food, only % actually did. The price premium of organic and local food put shoppers off. A lot has changed since then as consumers, producers and investors now recognise the impossible demands we have been making on our planet. We all want to produce food in a more sustainable way but itrsquos hard to know where to start and what exactly lsquogoodrsquo looks like. Last year, the UK charity Food Foundation produced Plating Up Progress , a report which assesses the food industryrsquos progress in transitioning to a healthy and sustainable food system. By combining the best practices within each type of food retailer, the report identies the gap between the average profile and the leadership profile .These inidual company scorecards make it easy to compare businesses and set the benchmark for what we could expect all companies to achieve today. Since we first researched this subject  years ago, public awareness has soared and, according to PUP, itrsquos now the major supermarkets that are publishing more clearly defined targets and disclosing more performance data than other food retailers. This is a great example of responsible capitalism at work mdash companies taking a longndashterm view and finding the opportunities that are out there to generate better and more sustainable financial s while contributing to resolving some of the big problems facing our world.It isnrsquot just a question of how we produce food, the type of food we eat matters too. Itrsquos becoming increasingly dficult to meet the protein needs of a growing global population with food sourced from animals mdash such as meat, dairy products and eggs mdash and we need alternatives. Assuming the worldrsquos population reaches . billion by  as predicted, demand for animalndashbased food is expected to increase by % from  levels, with beef increasing by %.A May  study on the environmental impact of food production, published in the journal Science, declared that avoiding meat and dairy products was the single biggest thing an inidual could do to help reduce environmental harm mdash more than reducing air travel or buying an electric car. Consumers are paying attention and changing their eating habits. The rise in popularity of Veganuary is evidence of this growing trend for meatndash and dairyndashfree diets. According to a  report from Waitrose, a third of UK consumers said they had deliberately reduced the amount of meat they eat or removed it from their diet entirely. One in eight Britons surveyed at the time were vegetarian or vegan and a further % said they were flexitarian.As well as the personal health benefits of reducing red meat and dairy consumption, there are concerns about the impacts of industrial meat production on wider consumer health. Transmissible bacterial infections, such as salmonella and campylobacter from contaminated poultry can quickly spread through large farms, while intensive livestock production has been implicated in a series of global health scares. Antibiotic resistance is also a risk, with intensive livestockndashrearing reliant on routine doses of antibiotics to prevent diseases. The overuse and misuse of antibiotics in cattle farminghas contributed to the development of antimicrobial resistance, or AMR for more on the fight against AMR and related opportunities, see our first Planet Papers: A responsible recovery.Green packagingIt isnrsquot just what we eat and how we produce it that matter, but how itrsquos packaged too. Plastic packaging is everywhere, because it is cheap, lightweight and durable, and serves a wide range of important s. But the plastic we use to package our food disperses through our environment, leading to contaminated ocean habitats and stricken marine le. What role can consumers and businesses play in solving this pressing issue for our planet Plastic waste will impact our environment for generations to come. Research in the July  edition of the journal Science Advances showed that the vast majority of synthetic plastic produced from the early s to  mdash . billion of a total . billion tonnes mdash was highly durable waste. UK consumers alone were discarding about  million plastic bottles a year, which will take an estimated  years at least to degrade. But solving this problem isnrsquot simply a case of avoiding companies with any kind of exposure to plastic mdash plastic use is a complex issue and focusing too narrowly on the product could simply replace one problem with another. As an example, plastic wrapping on a cucumber extends product le from three days to . Removing plastic in this scenario would therefore generate an offsetting increase in food waste. There are nevertheless many cases where we can identy and challenge unnecessary or excessive packaging.Singlendashuse plastics, such as disposable coffee cups and plastic cutlery, are all common sources of waste. Governments are stepping in mdash plastic straws are now banned in the UK mdash and we can all encourage companies to eliminate the unnecessary use of plastic and ensure that reusable, recyclable, or compostable alternatives are used wherever possible. Most importantly, we need to look at how all these dferent agents are interacting to promote or obstruct a more circular economy for plastic. We can encourage companies to think more holistically about their inputs and outputs, embrace innovation in business models and resource management, and support regulation that promotes better outcomes for the environment, society and, ultimately, for business.Consumers have a big role to play in the fight against plastic and theyrsquore already taking action. Greenbankrsquos research from December  showed that % of people had reduced their consumption of singlendash use plastic in the last  months, and % are trying to buy fewer consumer products. Many are now taking steps to ensure their actions as a consumer are having a positive impact and this means making more sustainable choices about where they spend and invest their money. When choosing products or services, over one in said they have made efforts in the last year to only buy econdashfriendly brands where possible. This growing awareness of the power of the consumer is having a direct impact on the businesses serving them. Of those surveyed, roughly a quarter said that investing in companies having a positive impact would be an important route to recovery for more on how changing consumer attitudes are leading to more sustainable business, see our previous Planet Papers: A brand new world.A reduction in consumption could especially help where wersquove gone into lsquooverdraftrsquo in terms of climate change, bioersity loss, land conversion and agricultural expansion. If we continue to live beyond our planetary means, these environmental risks will inevitably translate into financial and social risks. Consequently, there are huge opportunities for reducing this risk and improving the outlook for longndashterm social and financial s through innovation. One big challenge is finding alternatives to plastics. Very little of the plastic packaging produced in Europe is reused and only around % is collected for recycling. A report published in  by DS Smithin partnership with White Space Strategy found that . million tonnes of plasticcould be replaced each year from just five areas of supermarket packaging across Europe. Replacing plastic punnets for fruit and vegetables with paperndashbased alternatives alone represents an annual pound billion market opportunity.Of course, increased use of paper could present another set of problems, unless the extra supply can be sourced from recycled materials or through sustainable forest management. Increasing consumer demand is a crucial factor in encouraging businesses to make the transition to more sustainable practices, and for that we need to be patient. Deeply ingrained habits will take time to change. As investors we need to relieve pressure on companies to deliver quick s and maximise shortndashterm profits. Businesses, policymakers, investors and consumers need to work together to develop a system that relies less on physical resources, better serves the needs of all stakeholders and takes responsibility for the full lecycle of what it produces. There are opportunities for companies that react quickly and lead the way in sustainable food production and packaging, resulting in a healthy bottom line and a healthy planet. And together we can take a bite out of climate change.Find out more athttps:www.rathbones andwww.rathbones financial-awareness-for-young-people"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13091007.jpg?type=article-full","title":"library-fragile-history-andrew-pettegree-arthur-der-weduwen-review-alan-taylor","story":"Andrew Pettegree and Arthur der WeduwenProfile Books, poundReview by Alan TaylorIn another existence ndash and another millennium ndash I was a librarian. It is a mark on my curriculum vitae that I am proud to share with Casanova, Mao Tse-Tung and J Edgar Hoover. My first job was in a branch library off Edinburghrsquos Leith Walk, which had a characterful clientele. Lodged in my memory is an elderly woman called Daisy Miller who turned up more or less daily for a fix of Netta Muskett and Catherine Cookson, the latter being the then mainstay of the public library.Later, once I had acquired the necessary certicates, I was to be found in the reference department of the Carnegie-funded Central Library on George IV Bridge. It was a magnicent room and the collection was no less impressive. All and sundry flocked through its portals, some simply to seek shelter, others in search of information or ersion. It was the most democratic of institutions, free at the point of use, the embodiment of an enlightened, civilised society. That anyone could question its worth seemed to me a definition of philistinism.Some did, of course, such as the Fe-based ldquothink tank, the Adam Smith Institute, which proposed introducing fees. We were in the era of Thatcher and everything upon which cohesive communities were built was vulnerable.In The Library: A Fragile History, Andrew Pettegree and Arthur der Weduwen, both of the University of St Andrews, make no mention of the ideologues on their doorstep but do acknowledge that ldquothe economic tribulation of the s and s squeezed public finances and brought about ldquothe first sustained downturn in the fortunes of the public library. They argue ndash persuasively ndash that a consequence of this was the evolution of libraries ldquofrom an essential institution for the promotion of learning and civilising values, to a branch of the social services. Sensing the direction of travel, and having no desire to be a social worker, I threw my toys out of the pram and metamorphosed into a journalist. It could have been worse, I suppose I could have become director of the FBI.The key word in Pettegree and Weduwenrsquos subtitle is ldquofragile. As they demonstrate, libraries have, since time immemorial, been subject to forces outwith their custodiansrsquo control and have often been the hapless victims of war, fire, flood, pestilence, theft, neglect, the vagaries of inheritance and the invasiveness of nature, ignorance and prejudice.They begin with the fabled library of Alexandria , which is believed to have existed around the third century BC. No-one knows exactly the extent of its collection but estimates suggest it housed around , scrolls there may have been as many as half a million. Even by modern standards these were phenomenal accumulations, requiring organised accessioning, systematic cataloguing and a cadre of talented scholars engaged as librarians. What happened to the library is lost in the mists of time. Pettegree and Wedukenrsquos best guess is that it was destroyed during a Roman invasion.Over the centuries since, libraries became the preserve of the rich and powerful who, in the medieval heyday of illuminated manuscripts, were intent on outdoing rivals and impressing visitors. The libraries which they built were often as ornate as churches and galleries but little provision was made for those who wanted to read and study in them. Such are the vanities of the rich. Access to the libraries amassed by American millionaires in the th century, for example, was restricted to ldquogentleman scholars. The oil magnate Henry Folger was just one among several who refused to pander to the great unwashed, never allowing anyone to inspect his unrivalled collection of Shakespeare First Folios. Only after his death in  was the peerless Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington DC inaugurated.Scotland has, library-wise, a laudable history. As far back as the early years of the th century, James Kirkwood, a Presbyterian minister driven by a desire to replace Catholic Mass books, founded  libraries open to the public across the Highlands and Islands. What scuppered further expansion was the reluctance of the local population to submit to Protestant indoctrination.Andrew CarnegieMuch better known is the movement inspired by Andrew Carnegie whose vast wealth allowed him to endow thousands of libraries in the UK and US. An adept deal-maker, he offered seed money in exchange for a commitment by local authorities to run libraries. Reprehensible as some of his business practices may have been, his contribution to the growth of libraries is immeasurable.As is made clear in The Library, the fortunes of libraries cannot be orced from those of the book. In the eighth century, Charlemagne encouraged monks to reproduce popular texts. Thus, libraries were needed to accommodate them. In the s, the invention of printing by moveable type by Gutenberg suddenly made books affordable to many more people and the number of private libraries grew exponentially.Pettegree and Weduken describe - as ldquothe great age of the public library, and it would be churlish to disagree, despite the damage done to them by two world wars and the determined efforts of prudes to exorcise books in which sex was detected. The lting of the ban on Lady Chatterleyrsquos Lover in  was a watershed, not only for British society and the reading public but also for public libraries. Change, however, came dropping slow. When I first worked in libraries, DH Lawrencersquos novel was kept in a locked glass case alongside car manuals and guides to tropical fish, not, as I was assured, to prevent it reaching the mitts of impressionable readers but to thwart thieves. For all I know it is still there.It is a reminder of the bookrsquos ability to endure, as it has done for centuries, seeing off along the way, as the authors triumphantly write, ldquomany of the technological pall-bearers sent to conduct it to the crematorium. Few inventions can claim such longevity. And where there are books, there will be libraries, of that we can be assured.Pettegrew and Wedukenrsquos handsome book, which is lucidly written, mercully free of jargon and international in its ambition, ought to be in every one of them."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-indyref2-campaign-must-fought-tolerance-respect","story":"Mr Russell may also be shocked to know that a lady wearing a Better Together badge screamed abuse at my daughter and followed her theof Falkirk High Street as she pushed her pram, her toddler at her side, simply because she had politely told the lady that she was going to vote Yes.I witnessed no threatening behaviour from anyone at any polling station I visited, but I was astonished when one Better Together polling agent confided in me that as a Labour Party member hed felt obliged to toe the party line, but in the privacy of the polling booth, hed voted Yes. At another polling station, another person representing Better Together was also clearly unhappy about the position in which he found himself Im told he resigned from the Labour Party a few weeks later.Without doubt the upcoming independence referendum will be fought hard, and with passion and conviction it must also be fought with tolerance and respect from both sides of the constitutional question.Ruth Marr, Stirling.A MONOPOLY ON COMMON SENSE PETER A Russell claims to be among ldquothose who saved Scotland from ruin and who remain determined to stand up for rationality and common sense. Should we take from this that anyone who supports independence is ldquoirrational and lacking in ldquocommon sense Does Mr Russell claim the intellectual superiority to assume that he and his side simply have to be right  That around % of the electorate are ldquoirrational, lacking in ldquocommon sense and need protecting from themselves This is no basis for debate, indeed with their claimed, assumed rationality and monopoly of common sense, what need is there for debate Such unwillingness to even hold a debate is becoming the unionist mot. Mr Russell miscalls the  referendum as ldquomass hysteria and [a] national emotional spasm, when the Electoral Commission described it as having engaged the electorate to such a degree that at am polling staff found voters ldquokeen to express their preference on the referendum question. The day itself they described as ldquogood-natured throughout the day.Perhaps this gives some perspective to the description ldquofeartie , which hardly looms high in any list of insults. I can remember my own mother calling me a ldquobig feartie when, after dark, I was asked to go upstairs to collect something, but was unwilling to do so, afraid of the bogeyman who assuredly hid behind one of the doors. So, the use of ldquofeartie, the mildest of slights, is another opportunity to find fault with the Yes movement, confirming, asconfirmation were necessary, what the typical Yes supporter is like. Yetwe look at the evidence, after the referendum a Panelbase poll found that  per cent of those who had voted No had experienced online abuse, compared to % of those who had voted Yes.But when you start from the presumption not only that you are right, but must be right, evidence must be carefully selected, or avoided altogether.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.WE NEED INDY TO PROTECT FROM HARMMARTIN Williamsrsquos figures for the surge in fossil fuel use are UK-wide and there are no Scottish figures provided . Scotland produces more gas than it uses and renewables met % of Scotlandrsquos electricity demand in . Missing also is the fact that the Tories privatised the energy market, decided that the market would cope without gas storage and drove through a hard Brexit. We lost % of UK gas storage capacity in . The Tories withdrew from the EU energy market which helped control prices so after Brexit, we pay more.But as well as making a mess of gas management the Tories have no interest in addressing climate change, the most pressing issue in the energy field. The UK recently appointed someone who has repeatedly denied the reality of climate change as the international trade secretary. But any country which does not address climate change will face far worse economic consequences. Just one example given by Green co-leader Lorna Slater: without urgent action half of Glasgow could be underwater in a few decades as well as other coastal communities and millions made homeless.So Scotland needs to get independence to have full levers of power to protect the country from the present and future severe economic harm of Westminsterrsquos governance and address the issues of the day. Scotland can reduce consumption through insulating and building improvements and reduce dependence on fossil fuels while growing the very promising renewable sector including tidal energy which is not weather dependent. Scotlandrsquos oil and gas reserves can be properly managed by Scotland with an Oil Fund.Pol Yates, EdinburghMY PREDICTION FOR COPJOHN Milne accuses me of a \"relentless stream of negativity\" about climate change. If I may enlighten him with facts:The aim of COP is to achieve global net zero by  and restrict temperatures to .C above pre-industrial levels. Countries agreed to provide plans setting out how they would reduce their emissions ndash known as Nationally Determined Contributionsndash but China and the majority of the  countries failed to provide NDCs by the COP deadline. That COP was not an abject failure was the promise of a financial inducement . Developed countries promised to provide developing countries with a share of  billion every year. China, inexplicably classed as a developing country, has refused to submit plans for further emission cuts.Political realists have warned Boris Johnson that COP will be a flop. Prediction: At the last moment the .C goal will be dropped and the  billion climate cake will be dramatically increased. An embarrassing COP flop will be avoided but at enormous cost for UK taxpayers.Clark Cross, Linlithgow.FAITH OUGHT TO INFORM OUR POLITICSLORD Jim Wallace, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, tells us that Scottish faith leaders issued ldquoa joint statement in Challenge Poverty Week both highlighting the plight of many of our fellow citizens and urging action at all levels of government\" . This joint initiative is to be very much welcomed, there needing to be a spiritual input into the multitude of challenges currently facing humanity.Given the approach of COP it is particularly appropriate that the signatories call for an understanding that ldquomuch of the destructive impact of climate change falls on the worldrsquos poorest and most vulnerable communities. I would suggest that inidual members of the faith communities must hold to account the politicians responsible for a decade of austerity and its continuation under the current Government. In my opinion our faith ought to inform our politics.The Prime Minister will point to his strategy of levelling up, but what happens to those at the margins of society least able to cope meantime John Milne, Uddingston.HOW COULD POLICE CHIEF NOT KNOW WITHIN the context of Rhona Malones victimisation case citing Police Scotland being upheld, the evidence of her former line manager Inspector Keith Warhurst to the tribunal was described as being \"contradictory, confusing and ultimately incredible\" .

Women are not simply objects to be rented.Tackling this degrading idea requires shting our focus to the demand for sex ndash which fuels both prostitution and sex trafficking ndash and criminalising purchasers. Other countries have done this. It ought not to be controversial.Prostitution is inherently dangerous. It can never be made \"safe\". The Government recognises this in its ldquoEqually Safe strategy, which already describes prostitution as a form of male violence against women.We call on ministers to listen to the voice of victims of commercial sexual exploitation, womenrsquos groups and others who are demanding the \"Nordic Model Now\".Lauren Agnew, Human Trafficking Officer, CARE for Scotland, Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-search-cheap-fuel-put-precious-peatlands-brink-lost-forever","story":"The Flow Country is so special that moves are afoot to have its expanse of peatlands and wetlands confirmed as a World Heritage Site.While such is the importance of peat in carbon capture, that next monthrsquos COP delegates will be able to step inside a lsquoPeatland Pavilionrsquo, a giant hub where they can explore the story of peat in detail, discuss and negotiate its future.Yet  years ago this winter and just a stonersquos throw from the site of the climate crisis conference in the grime of a Clydebank engineering workshop, a major step forward had been taken towards using Scotlandrsquos huge peat reserves to fuel a new breed of electricity power stations.Had what now sounds like an alarming plan to remove up to  million tons of Scottish peat to burn in electricity power stations around the country proceeded, not only would Scotland have lost a highly efficient carbon sink, but immeasurable damage would have been done to countless rare plants, creatures and the environment.In the days long before concerns over a global climate crisis, the unveiling in December  of the worldrsquos first peat-burning gas turbine ndash effectively a modied jet engine - at John Brown  Corsquos Clydebank testing shop created huge excitement.The idea had originated in the post-war s, as attention turned to how to make the most of Scotlandrsquos vast areas of peatlands, with suggestions ranging from sending it to Americarsquos dust bowls to extracting oils, waxes and chemicals for a iety of products.The success of Scotlandrsquos new hydro-electricity plants, which overcame natural obstacles to harness the power of Highland water, and rising coal and oil costs provided inspiration to put peat to a previously unexplored use.By October , a pound, survey of Scotlandrsquos peat bogs was underway with the intention of determining peatrsquos suitability to be used as fuel, while Sir Edward MacColl, Deputy Chairman of the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board and the driving force behind successful hydro schemes, pushed ahead with plans for a new source of electric power.At shipbuilding giant John Brownrsquos in Clydebank, engineers and scientists were put to work figuring out how to reduce the moisture content of the waterlogged peat, and to develop a closed cycle turbine which could burn it and turn it into electricity.The result, unveiled in December , was an experimental  horsepower gas turbine, originally run on oil and equipped with a peat-burning air heater and peat-drying equipment ndash the first of its kind.Its development was, Sir Edward Appleton, chairman of the newly formed Scottish Peat Committee, an achievement ldquoto be compared with Stevensonrsquos Rocket and Henry Bellrsquos Comet.Enthusiasm was riding high: although peat has a lower caloric value than coal, total workable deposits were put at ,, tons ndash the equivalent to ,, tons of coal and enough to keep burning to ten years.Studies were carried out from Perthshire to Ayrshire, Lewis and the Flow Country of Caithness and Sutherland to find the best location for a new peat power station. One focused on Flanders Moss in west Stirlingshire, now a nature reserve and one of the largest remaining intact raised bogs in Britain. In existence for  years, highly regarded for its mosaic of sphagnum mosses and a haven for small creatures, it also narrowly avoided becoming a site for horticultural peat harvesting.The ldquomost notable findings of the survey, however, were found hundreds of miles north, within the , hectares of Flow country blanket bog.Surrounded by huge areas of moorland and with a population of just  people, Altnabreac in Caithness was barely known beyond the Caithness boundary.However, peat-fuelled electricity was set to put it on the map.In July , Scottish Secretary James Stuart, the MP for Moray and Nairn, announced the small community would be at the heart of a pound, plan for the UKrsquos first peat power station, and the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board set about commissioning a kW closed-cycle peat-fired gas turbine.If successful, the hope was to proceed with larger schemes ldquoin a number of suitable areas in the Highlands.There were plenty of reasons to push ahead: in Caithness and Sutherland alone, peat-fired power stations were said to have the potential to provide work for up to  men with up to , jobs across the country.And once drained, the once soggy peatland could become rich arable and pasture farmland, supporting dozens of new farms and workers.A nagging problem was peatrsquos soggy and fibrous nature, and whether the John Brown test turbine could work on a commercial scale.While hindsight would suggest an even bigger issue would be the loss of unspoiled peatlands and their effectiveness as a carbon sink, while the burning peat to make electricity would lead to more carbon dioxide emissions than natural gas and coal.That, however, would be for future generations to worry about.By  national and international eyes were on Altnabreacrsquos peat-fired Braehour power station and its innovative closed-cycle burner.But while it was a marvel of s technology, it turned out to be the peat power stationrsquos undoing.Work began in  with huge machines the like never seen before in the area, delivered by train and used to extract the first supplies of peat.But it was a slow process. A  AGM report to the North of Scotland Hydro Electric Board ndash which would later become part of energy business SSE ndash reported: ldquoPeat experiment at Altnabrea: the power station building is completed and erection of peat handling and pulversing plant is started. Steady progress has been made in harvesting peat over a working area of approximately  acres.The project was two years behind schedule by the time full-scale tests began in August . Luckily for Scotlandrsquos peatlands, they were less spectacular than had been hoped.Brown, fluffy ash created by the burning peat blocked up the heater passages, while the power consumed by the pulverisers and fans was far higher than had been expected, making the entire plant less efficient than originally hoped.Costs soared. A pound, investment needed to amend the gas turbine coincided with an influx of cheap oil imports and improved coal production.When it emerged a unit of peat-generated electricity would cost .d compared to .d for a diesel-generated unit, a rethink was inevitable.By , the dream of peat-fired electricity was over.What was a failure at the time, however, could scarcely have been better news for the environment. Scotlandrsquos peat avoided the fate that befell others in Ireland, Finland, Germany and Russia, where a dferent kind of turbine method had been adopted.There was, however, one benefactor from the electricity generated by Altnabreacrsquos peat-fuelled turbines.Transmitted a few miles north, electricity sparked by burning peat moulded by nature over thousands of years, was put to use in the construction of a dferent kind of power plant, at Dounreay.Professor Roxane Andersen of the Environmental Research Institute, UHI, said: \"We know now that our degraded peatlands in the UK contribute an estimated  million tons of COe yr-into the atmosphere, enough to switch our whole land use sector from a net sink to a net source.\"This perhaps exemplies the importance of keeping peatlands wet, and in good condition, and the role that peatland conservation and restoration can play in our current efforts to limit global climate change and bioersity declines.\"Global change wasnrsquot a reality back in the s and in subsequent decades, when peat was mostly considered a resource to be exploited, and peatlands as areas to target for land use conversion.\"If the plans for large-scale extractions had gone ahead, their legacy today would be higher emissions still, and most likely the loss of some wildle and peatland plant refugia.\"While our understanding and appreciation of peatlands is growing, it remains a challenge to convey the urgency with which we need to act to safeguard those peatlands that remains and the ones that need to be restored now."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13110353.jpg?type=article-full","title":"unique-glass-artwork-alasdair-gray-lost-local-authority","story":"A prolic artist, his remarkable murals, designs and illustrations are coveted by collectors, while museums including the National Gallery of Scotland and Glasgow Museums hold collections of his work.But now it appears a unique artwork created by Gray in a collaboration with leading Scottish glass artist Siobhan Healy has been lsquolostrsquo by the local authority which commissioned it.The brightly coloured stained-glass  was unveiled at Alloa Library in  as part of a major investment in Scottish artworks by Clackmannanshire Council and paid for using public funds.Designed by Gray and handcrafted by Ms Healy, whose glasswork has received international recognition, the work embraced the themes of migration and immigration, and showed the movement of people to and from Scotland surrounded by the phrase ldquoOutgoers and incomers made, make every land.The theme and design were particularly close to the lsquoLanarkrsquo authorrsquos heart ndash he later used the design as the cover of his book, Independence: An Argument for Home Rule, which set out his thoughts on Scottish independence in the run up to the  referendum.The design was also made into a rug by renowned Edinburgh tapestry studio, Dovecot.However, it has now emerged that the m square stained glass , understood to be the writer and artistrsquos only glass artwork, has vanished from a council shed where it had been stored following the libraryrsquos closure.A council spokesperson said extensive searches had failed to locate the , and that a senior officer from the authority would now be writing to Ms Healy to apologise for its loss.However, the artworkrsquos disappearance has angered glass artist Healy, who says she has made regular enquiries to the local authority questioning its whereabouts since Alloa Library closed in .She said: ldquoI dont understand why a senior officer would want to apologise to me about it.

And when that light hits the sky, itrsquos not just a call. Itrsquos a warning.Kravitz, who plays Catwoman Selina Kyle, makes a dramatic entrance as she is seen high-kicking someone in the head.Her character then asks Batman: ldquoMaybe wersquore not so dferent.

As in that political satire, the swearing in Succession has been raised to an art form.Characters are brutal towards each other, but since they are all such horrible people with zip in the way of redeeming qualities we do not carethe worst happens to them. Itrsquos gladiators v gladiators out there, not lions v Christians.Just as in The Thick of It, the cast are so comfortable with each other, and the writing so slick, the drama moves like a well-oiled farce.The actors donrsquot need to fight over the juiciest lines because there are enough for everybody. Where other comedy-dramas might have a miserly handful of zingers, the multiple Emmy-winning Succession throws them around like confetti.In an ensemble as good as this, it should be dficult to choose a favourite, but who are we ******* kidding here  Brian Coxrsquos swearmaster-in-chief commands every scene he is in.Logan, one of the most fascinating TV characters in years, is a charming psychopath who long ago wearied of the charming part of the deal.He is, as cousin Greg likes to say, ldquoall killer, no filler, a man who has clawed his way out of poverty in Scotland , a modern day robber baron who thinks tough love is the only kind that will equip his children to survive in this rotten world .Courtesy of Cox, Logan can make Daniel Day-Lewisrsquos oilman in There Will Be Blood look like Santa.The third series opener could have been a stop-start affair aiming to pick up new viewers who have heard the buzz about Succession and fancy seeing what the fuss is about.That Armstrong gives it the pace of a runaway train is a promising sign that he is not short of ideas about where to take the story and is in a hurry to get there.

I thought it might be fitting for the bell to be recommissioned and used again in remembrance of the  lives lost.”Towards the end of , Bill contacted a local craftsman and friend, Richard Wilson, and askedhe could help. It had been hoped to have the clapper made and fitted ready for the anniversary in , however plans had to be delayed due to the pandemic.In the meantime, Richard carried out online research and was eventually able to get inside the Cathedral to measure up, acquiring the bronze for the clapper proved dficult locally so he had to source it online.“It took me around a fortnight to make the clapper in my shed at home mostly using a hobby lathe and a CNC router,# said Richard.#I was a bit taken aback when Bill asked me to do this for him. Obviously, it is a great honour and a privilege for me to be asked considering the history of the ship and the lives lost during the sinking.#Hopefully this clapper will be around for years to come and will be used to commemorate the event each year.”However, this was only half the tale. The clapper needed a tassel — a rope that someone would actually hold to ring the bell.Fran Hollinrake is the visitor services officer and custodian at the cathedral.She said that, having attended several commemorations over the years, her and her husband Andy became friendly with a couple, John and Tracy Welch.John’s father, Stoker Petty Officer John Welch, was on board HMS Royal Oak the night she sank, but he survived.His son, John, was a rigger in the Tyneside dockyards, and spent much of his working le working with ropes, but ill-health prevented John from making the tassel.Instead he passed the job on to his former apprentice and friend Paul New.John and his we Tracy arrived in Orkney this week and were present at the unveiling.John said of his father#s experience on that fateful night: #The night of the sinking he was on deck having a cigarette when the explosion happened. He managed to get off the ship and into the water and was picked up by the Daisy II.#He said he had held on to another chap in the water who was in dficulty,  as he was an excellent swimmer and had medals for le saving and water polo, but when they were both pulled aboard by the crew of the Daisy unfortunately the other chap had died. He was lucky to escape with burns to his hands and face.#After medical attention I think a week or so later he was sent back to Portsmouth to join another ship.“As I far as I can remember he never ed to Orkney, but after the war attended the reunions in Portsmouth on a regular basis. As for his feelings about that night it wasn’t something he went into in great detail, but he did say thathe could get back on the ship he would know exactly where his gold lighter and cigarette case were.#Representing the council, who maintain the Cathedral on behalf of the people of Orkney, Councillor Stephen Clackson also has a personal connection to the Royal Oak, having tragically lost his uncle Ronald George Clackson when the ship went down.He said: “My Uncle Ronny was the closest sibling in age to my dad and his favourite brother. He was very technically minded and joined the Royal Navy on July , , aged ¾, for ‘  ’ years.#After training at the shore establishment HMS Victory, he was posted to the recommissioned HMS Royal Oak as an ordinary seaman on June , , when the ship was expected to be embarking on a -month tour of the Mediterranean.#Looming hostilities set the course of the battleship in another direction, and by August she was in Scapa Flow. My uncle was reported missing presumed killed when the Royal Oak was sunk by torpedoes from the U- in the early hours of October , just a week after his th birthday.#The news was devastating for my grandmother, whose brother had been killed on the Somme in World War I at the same age, and she never really got over it.

Butyou want people to travel dferently, then yoursquove got to remove the barriers, and secure parking comes up time and time again as an essential part of it.MrBoardman said it he would be ldquohappy to lobby Government to secure funding for more hangars in GreaterManchester, andbelievesthey should be rolled out nationwide.Anthony Lau, founder ofCyclehoop,thefirm which providesmany of the UKrsquos cyclehangars, said every time one is installed ldquodemand is created for two more units by word of mouth from new members.He defended their price, stating that ldquofor roughly the cost of a couple of coffees each month users getaccessiblecycle storageprotected from the elementsanddecrease the chance of theft andvandalism.Leo Murray, director of innovation at climate charity Possible,warned thatPrime Minister Boris Johnsonrsquos ambition for a ldquogolden age of cycling is at risk of failing because councils are not able tomeet ldquosoaring local demand for cycling infrastructure.Hesaid: ldquoThe prevailing lack of secure storage for bikes is routinely identied as one of the biggest barriers to increasing cycling uptake, particularly for low income andinner cityhouseholds for whom indoor space is at a premium.MrMurraysaiditwasldquoabsurdthatpeople with bicycles aresometimes beingcharged more for storage than residents who park their cars on the road,and a better solution was needed for more deprived neighbourhoods.He called for the Government to put more funding forcycle storage fundingon the table as part of its commitment to active travel.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Crofting is the basis for so many of the settlements on Skye outwith Portree, Broadford and Kyleakin and this should have been acknowledged.“There is quite a signicant impact from crofting on the economic and social well-being of Skye and Raasay. You only have to look at the , high quality calves sold for high prices last week in Portree to see that.”In terms of infrastructure improvements to support crofting, Mr Murray said the auction mart in Portree must be redeveloped to improve parking and animal welfare, and an abattoir facility must be provided so that livestock does not have to be driven to Dingwall.He added: “We are being told by the Scottish Crofting Federation that there is a huge demand for new crofts.#To meet that demand we either have to encourage landowners to make this happen or there has to be acquisition of an estate.“If we want to keep our young people in our communities we need to address the availability of crofts.”The Scottish Government are guilty of an “abject failure” when it comes to creating new crofts on publicly-owned land, Mr Murray added.Stung by the criticism, the council said they hoped to “discuss the plan further with organisations like the Crofting Commission” and would be keen to hear from any other interested parties.A spokeswoman said: “Skye and Raasay Future has been prepared with and by wider representatives of the community across the area.#It reflects people’s vision and priorities for the future, following feedback gathered through workshops and online consultations held throughout the year.“In workshop discussions, the important role that crofting plays in the identity and culture of Skye and Raasay communities has been clearly referenced..#Skye councillor John Finlayson said all stakeholders should be involved in “shaping, evaluating and changing” the plan’s priorities and he acknowledged the importance of crofting “in all its guises” across Skye and Raasay.He added: “Crofting is still a central part of le on Skye and while it is part of our history and culture it will also I hope continue to be a key part of our future and it is an important element of SARF.#As those who took part in the engagement to create the initial plan agreed, it is important that representatives from the crofting community are fully engaged in the continued development and implementation of the plan and I am confident this will happen.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4156276.jpg--.jpg?1634197334000\n","title":"st vincent de paul member roadshow visits ballymena","story":"THE Society of St Vincent de Paul has hosted a series of Member Roadshows, visiting towns and cities across the province, to engage with members in person for the first time since March last year.As well as providing representatives of more than , members from  SVP Conferences across Northern Ireland with an overview of the Society and how it has responded to the tens of thousands who have needed its support most in the past  months. Together with its plans for Christmas  and beyond, the events provided delegates with an opportunity to meet Mary Waide who was elected Regional President for the North Region at the beginning of the pandemic.Following opening prayers and a welcome by Mary Waide, regional board members of SVP took to the stage to present ious aspects of the Society’s work to assembled guests representing their local SVP Conferences.Following a thought provoking spiritual reflection, board members presented the Society’s retail strategy for its  Vincent’s shops in Northern Ireland, a report of the outreach into prisons, details of how each Conference should report on its finances and new ways of adhering to policies and procedures for those being assisted by the charity and those providing the assistance.An interactive element encouraged guests to engage in a healthy discussion with board members before closing prayers. Mary Waide, Regional President of SVP North Region, said: “I am absolutely delighted with the success of this series of SVP Member Roadshows and the feedback from those who were able to attend.It was important for the SVP regional board to get out into our local communities having had such a long time apart from our members face to face. The focus of the roadshows were to primarily express our gratitude to our members for the sterling work they have been continuing to do on the ground to help those who have needed it most, during the most trying of times, and to share with them our SVP vision for the longer term. “The dedication of members of SVP has never been more important than it has been in the past  months. I know from experience how daunting it has been trying to help the vulnerable in our community without compromising or risking the health of those who are supporting those in need. As we move forward, it is my hope that our Conferences in County Antrim continue to go from strength to strength under the guidance of Frederic Ozanam who founded SVP almost  years ago.”SVP is an international charity and the largest voluntary charity in Ireland. SVP members in Northern Ireland work in all communities to support people whatever their background, who are experiencing poverty and social exclusion, promoting self-sufficiency and working for social justice. Every year SVP spends approximately pound million to help those experiencing poverty in Northern Ireland. Last year, SVP responded to tens of thousands of calls for assistance from members of the public.

Photo: Liam McBurney PA WireRodney EdwardsTwitterEmailOctober   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailSenior politicians, including Infrastructure Minister Nicola Mallon, are having to review their security arrangements after being targeted by Covid- conspiracy theorists, the Sunday Independent has revealed.The Police Service of Northern Irelandis investigating intimidating behaviour by a group who delivered a “letter of liability” to the SDLP MLA’s office in North Belfast last week accusing her of harming children by endorsing the coronavirus vaccine.Read MoreSecurity of NI politicians should be reviewed in wake of Sir David Amess murder, says Justice Minister Naomi LongNew threats made against Health Minister Robin SwannMs Mallon has been given  days to “withdraw” all pandemic-related restrictions and stop the vaccination or face “litigation”.“It’s very upsetting, it’s a very frightening experience, particularly for my staff. It makes me anxious,” she said.Four people visited Ms Mallon’s office, with one woman filming her staff and insisting on leaving paperwork that put her on “notice of liability for harm and death”.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “We are now reviewing our security arrangements,” confirmed Ms Mallon.SDLP leader and Foyle MP Colum Eastwood has also been threatened with arrest by one group for “genocide” while DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson, Northern Ireland Secretary of State Brandon Lewis and Sinn Fein MP Michelle Gildernew have been accused of an “indictable crime”.In an email, the politicians have been told claims will be made against themthey are found to be responsible for “contributory manslaughter” should death occur from the vaccine.Mr Eastwood, who has raised the issue with police on behalf of his SDLP colleagues, received a letter which read: “We have prima facie evidence linking you to the facilitating of this mass genocide.”“I think there are sinister elements to the movement and that concerns me,” said Mr Eastwood, who was commenting  hours after Conservative MP Sir David Amess was murdered as he held a constituency surgery in Essex.Dr Anne McCloskey, the suspended Derry GP who is a close ally of one of Ireland’s most prolic Covid deniers Dolores Cahill, is behind a letter targeting SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin. Ms McCloskey, who could not be reached for comment yesterday, warns failure to comply to the notice could result in a “criminal prosecution”.“Absurdly, it holds me ‘personally liable’ for ‘supporting crimes against humanity’,” Ms McLaughlin said.Ms McLaughlin believes anti-vaccination “propaganda” is why some people are refusing to take the vaccine.“This is a very serious public health concern which will have contributed to the number of people who have fallen seriously ill and died from Covid,”  she said.A spokesman for the Executive Office said it does not comment on security matters relating to its ministers..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadCocaine kingpin Noel Johnston plunged to death during police raid on Ballymena flatNorth Belfast woman still holds UK’s youngest gran titleWatch: Glentoran goalkeeper Aaron McCarey sent off for ‘moment of madness’ clash with team-mate Bobby BurnsFirst pictures of cop accused of sex assault on hospital patientCop could face prosecution over fatal shooting of IRA leaderTop VideosPlay year old Jim Copeland raising money for his granddaughter#s charityPlayKatrina Rainey Knockloughrim killing: Mancharged with murder of womanPlayFuneral held for Chieftains founder Paddy MoloneyLatest Northern Ireland‘Dream come true’ as Mark Allen wins Northern Ireland OpenFra McCaffrey: ‘My dad’s a nice man and didn’t deserve this’Family left devastated after electrician Adam Newell killed following work-related accidentJohn LavertyOpinionDrug dealer Noel Johnston was the hardest of hard men in a dangerous town... and he was only a teenager at the timeHalloween is coming and there are plenty of spooky shows throughout NILatest‘Dream come true’ as Mark Allen wins Northern Ireland OpenFra McCaffrey: ‘My dad’s a nice man and didn’t deserve this’Rea vows to take fight all the way to final lapPresident leads tributes to poet Brendan KennellyMajor baggage system issue at Stansted described as ‘chaos’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The People’s Park receives the title for a fth successive year following its extensive pound. million regeneration in . The Green Flag is a worldwide award to recognise publicly accessible parks and green spaces that meet strict, benchmarked criteria including maintenance, sustainability, safety and community involvement. googletag.cmd.push A total of  parks and open spaces have been recognised with a Green Flag Award for , including four new Green Flag Awards, one new Community Award and one new Green Flag Heritage Award. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, congratulated the staff at the park for the retention of the status. “Brooke Park is a real gem in the heart of the city and it has been maintained resplendently over the last five years for everyone to enjoy,” he said. “During the lockdown restrictions it was a place where people could visit to relax and enjoy the outdoors and children enjoyed the state of the art play facilities in a safe environment.     “Congratulations to council’s parks team for all their hard work in ensuring the park met the criteria for the Green Flag which I’m sure will highlight the park’s offering to new visitors this year.” Rachel Vaughan, who manages the Green Flag Awards programme, said she hoped people would use the awards as an incentive to visit some new places in one of the most beautul seasons of the year. “We all love a walk through the autumn leaves and it’s uplting to discover a new spot to enjoy,” she said. “When you visit a Green Flag park or open space you can be reassured that the location is being managed to a really high standard as they’ve been through a rigorous judging process that assesses sites across a range of issues including their horticultural standards, cleanliness, bioersity and safety. “At a time when many people’s finances are under pressure, it’s important to highlight the fact that all Green Flag spaces are free to everyone.” Parks and open spaces play a hugely important role in supporting the health and wellbeing of local communities and come in many shapes and sizes. The expert judges, who are all volunteers themselves, were delighted to include several community spaces in this year’s selection, which are also run and managed by volunteers at a local level. These include: Shellinghill Park and Millennium Path, Sentry Hill Community Garden, Footprints Women’s Centre, Rathfern Activity Centre, Toome Linear Walk and Ballyeaston Church Ruin. Special Green Flag Heritage Awards were presented to Stormont Estate, Brooke Park, Sentry Hill Historic House and Visitor Centre, Antrim Castle Gardens and Clotworthy House, Queen’s University Belfast, Warrenpoint Municipal Park, Newry Canal and Belfast Botanic Gardens.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  St Columbs College is celebrating the ,th anniversary of the birth of St Columba.Derry NewsFormer pupil to kick off Colleges Columban celebrations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Alderman Graham Warke, congratulated the staff at the park for the retention of the status. “Brooke Park is a real gem in the heart of the city and it has been maintained resplendently over the last five years for everyone to enjoy,” he said. “During the lockdown restrictions it was a place where people could visit to relax and enjoy the outdoors and children enjoyed the state of the art play facilities in a safe environment.     “Congratulations to council’s parks team for all their hard work in ensuring the park met the criteria for the Green Flag which I’m sure will highlight the park’s offering to new visitors this year.” Rachel Vaughan, who manages the Green Flag Awards programme, said she hoped people would use the awards as an incentive to visit some new places in one of the most beautul seasons of the year. “We all love a walk through the autumn leaves and it’s uplting to discover a new spot to enjoy,” she said. “When you visit a Green Flag park or open space you can be reassured that the location is being managed to a really high standard as they’ve been through a rigorous judging process that assesses sites across a range of issues including their horticultural standards, cleanliness, bioersity and safety. “At a time when many people’s finances are under pressure, it’s important to highlight the fact that all Green Flag spaces are free to everyone.” Parks and open spaces play a hugely important role in supporting the health and wellbeing of local communities and come in many shapes and sizes. The expert judges, who are all volunteers themselves, were delighted to include several community spaces in this year’s selection, which are also run and managed by volunteers at a local level. These include: Shellinghill Park and Millennium Path, Sentry Hill Community Garden, Footprints Women’s Centre, Rathfern Activity Centre, Toome Linear Walk and Ballyeaston Church Ruin. Special Green Flag Heritage Awards were presented to Stormont Estate, Brooke Park, Sentry Hill Historic House and Visitor Centre, Antrim Castle Gardens and Clotworthy House, Queen’s University Belfast, Warrenpoint Municipal Park, Newry Canal and Belfast Botanic Gardens.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  St Columbs College is celebrating the ,th anniversary of the birth of St Columba.Derry NewsFormer pupil to kick off Colleges Columban celebrations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Columba is a figure as multi-faceted as his names are numerous, be it Columba, Colmcille or Columb. googletag.cmd.push This year marks the ,th anniversary of the birth of one of the patron saints of the island. Columba, who was a prolic founder of monasteries, is credited with founding the city of Derry upon the rocks that mark where Long Tower Church stands today. However, Columba was not merely a meek monastery founder but someone who exhibited the courage of his convictions in stories as wide ranging as confronting Pictish tribes in modern-day Scotland to immersing himself in transcription and the reproduction of manuscripts. With Columba as its patron, St. Columb’s College will stage a year of celebration in honour of the momentous anniversary of Columba’s birth.     A Mass, celebrated by Bishop McKeown, on June  this year marked the start of this year of celebration that will culminate on June  next year.. The celebrations will entail the celebrating of Columba in his totality from Columba the scholar to Columba the seafarer to Columba the warrior, to name but a few. St. Columb’s College is inviting members of the public to its inaugural event on Friday, October  next at :pm in St. Eugene’s Cathedral Church Hall, Infirmary Road.  Dr Stephen Kelly.  Nathan Thiruvengadam, from the Colleges Columba Committee, said: “We are delighted to announce that Dr Stephen Kelly, past pupil and recipient of the Queen’s University Student Union Award for most iInspir- ing motivating teacher in both  and in , will be delivering a talk titled: Calves and Kindles: St Columba and the History of the Book. “Dr. Kelly, who is the author of the upcoming Imagining History in Medieval Britain, as well as co-editor of Betwixt and Between: Place and Cultural Translationand Imagining the Book , will walk us through the questions: Can it be true that St. Columba left Ireland over a book  Why was the act of copying St Finnian’s Psalter such an affront  What was a Psalter anyway, and how did it come to represent such a powerful instrument of cultural prestige and political authority  The talk will situate the Cathach of St Columba within the context of late classical and medieval ‘book culture.’ It will argue that the book is the most signicant technological innovation in Western culture, while also suggesting that the book and its metaphors continue, even in a digital age, to shape profoundly our under- standing of memory, history – and ourselves.” “The event is open to all be you young or old an expert or a novice on the background of our city’s founder- all are welcome. “The event is free but email columba@ stcolumbscollege.org to con- firm your attendance. “Tea and refreshments will be provided after the talk.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Columba is a figure as multi-faceted as his names are numerous, be it Columba, Colmcille or Columb. googletag.cmd.push This year marks the ,th anniversary of the birth of one of the patron saints of the island. Columba, who was a prolic founder of monasteries, is credited with founding the city of Derry upon the rocks that mark where Long Tower Church stands today. However, Columba was not merely a meek monastery founder but someone who exhibited the courage of his convictions in stories as wide ranging as confronting Pictish tribes in modern-day Scotland to immersing himself in transcription and the reproduction of manuscripts. With Columba as its patron, St. Columb’s College will stage a year of celebration in honour of the momentous anniversary of Columba’s birth.     A Mass, celebrated by Bishop McKeown, on June  this year marked the start of this year of celebration that will culminate on June  next year.. The celebrations will entail the celebrating of Columba in his totality from Columba the scholar to Columba the seafarer to Columba the warrior, to name but a few. St. Columb’s College is inviting members of the public to its inaugural event on Friday, October  next at :pm in St. Eugene’s Cathedral Church Hall, Infirmary Road.  Dr Stephen Kelly.  Nathan Thiruvengadam, from the Colleges Columba Committee, said: “We are delighted to announce that Dr Stephen Kelly, past pupil and recipient of the Queen’s University Student Union Award for most iInspir- ing motivating teacher in both  and in , will be delivering a talk titled: Calves and Kindles: St Columba and the History of the Book. “Dr. Kelly, who is the author of the upcoming Imagining History in Medieval Britain, as well as co-editor of Betwixt and Between: Place and Cultural Translationand Imagining the Book , will walk us through the questions: Can it be true that St. Columba left Ireland over a book  Why was the act of copying St Finnian’s Psalter such an affront  What was a Psalter anyway, and how did it come to represent such a powerful instrument of cultural prestige and political authority  The talk will situate the Cathach of St Columba within the context of late classical and medieval ‘book culture.’ It will argue that the book is the most signicant technological innovation in Western culture, while also suggesting that the book and its metaphors continue, even in a digital age, to shape profoundly our under- standing of memory, history – and ourselves.” “The event is open to all be you young or old an expert or a novice on the background of our city’s founder- all are welcome. “The event is free but email columba@ stcolumbscollege.org to con- firm your attendance. “Tea and refreshments will be provided after the talk.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

They will receive a National Trust voucher to the value of pound. Aine and John began growing their own food this year after signing up to the National Lottery funded Acorn FarmI can growproject which involves  local families being mentored by a horticulturalist in growing their own fruit and vegetables over an-monthperiod. googletag.cmd.push Participants have received raised beds, seedlings and guidance on how to nurture their plants. Primary one teacher, Aine Kivlehan, said: Weve never won anything before, so this is a lovely surprise. Its incredibly satisfying eating a meal with ingredients grown in your garden. My son John really enjoys it too and we both find its a great way to relax. Im hoping to set up a little gardening club for some local children in the coming months to pass on some of the lessons weve learned as part of the wonderful Acorn Farm I can grow project. We are just so delighted to be part of this and to be given the opportunity to do something so positive for our environment.     Having done a little bit of growing in the past, Aine was excited to see the Acorn FarmI can growprojects call out for interest to people in the Derry City and Strabane District area and signed up to be part of it. John really loves checking on the veg and watering the plants and Ive enjoyed getting some tips from the horticulturalist which Ive passed onto friends. Its lovely being able to lt something from your back garden and bring it into the kitchen to cook for dinner. It has been catching too with neighbours popping over to have a look and being inspired to give growing a go themselves. Mayor Warke congratulated the pair, saying, It fills me with pride to see a local family like the Kivlehans doing their bit for the environment and turning their hand to growing their own food. Not only is this a lovely bonding activity for families, but it saves money and helps our environment too, reducing our reliance on importing fruit and vegetables from farther afield. This helps cut carbon emissions and eases the pressures on nature. One of the positive things about the pandemic is how it has prompted people to connect to nature and start thinking about the journey of food and how we can become more self-sufficient and sustainable.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  St Columbs College is celebrating the ,th anniversary of the birth of St Columba.Derry NewsFormer pupil to kick off Colleges Columban celebrations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Local climate and environmental campaigners recently formed a Derry North West COP Climate Action organising hub geared towards organising actions on the thNovember and during the two week UN conference. googletag.cmd.push Representatives from the Derry North West COP Climate Action said: ‘So far governments have done too little, too late, colluding with corporations and continuing the exploitation of workers and the planet. We urge everyone who understands the threat posed by climate change to join protests because it is only through the mass mobilisation that we can build the kind of pressure needed for urgent, radical and systemic action to address the climate crisis.’ At September’s full meeting, Derry and Strabane Council backed People Before Profit Councillor Maeve O’Neills motion calling for support for the th of November Global Day of Actionin Derry and across these islands.     Cllr ONeill said, ‘The decisions made at COP will shape how governments respond, or not, to the climate crisis. Westminster, the Stormont Executive and the Daacuteil governments have failed to take the urgent and radical action needed. People power is the key to forcing decision makers away fromGovernment’sdo-nothing systemicapproach,focusing only on inidual actions. Thesystemicchange needed to avert catastrophic climate change actually has the potential to improve the quality of le for the vast majority of people on the planet.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  St Columbs College is celebrating the ,th anniversary of the birth of St Columba.Derry NewsFormer pupil to kick off Colleges Columban celebrations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Local climate and environmental campaigners recently formed a Derry North West COP Climate Action organising hub geared towards organising actions on the thNovember and during the two week UN conference. googletag.cmd.push Representatives from the Derry North West COP Climate Action said: ‘So far governments have done too little, too late, colluding with corporations and continuing the exploitation of workers and the planet. We urge everyone who understands the threat posed by climate change to join protests because it is only through the mass mobilisation that we can build the kind of pressure needed for urgent, radical and systemic action to address the climate crisis.’ At September’s full meeting, Derry and Strabane Council backed People Before Profit Councillor Maeve O’Neills motion calling for support for the th of November Global Day of Actionin Derry and across these islands.     Cllr ONeill said, ‘The decisions made at COP will shape how governments respond, or not, to the climate crisis. Westminster, the Stormont Executive and the Daacuteil governments have failed to take the urgent and radical action needed. People power is the key to forcing decision makers away fromGovernment’sdo-nothing systemicapproach,focusing only on inidual actions. Thesystemicchange needed to avert catastrophic climate change actually has the potential to improve the quality of le for the vast majority of people on the planet.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  St Columbs College is celebrating the ,th anniversary of the birth of St Columba.Derry NewsFormer pupil to kick off Colleges Columban celebrations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm.     When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  St Columbs College is celebrating the ,th anniversary of the birth of St Columba.Derry NewsFormer pupil to kick off Colleges Columban celebrations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Tel     Facebook Talking To Our Babies   www.shantallow.net  I was chatting with my niece and talking about last weeks article which was all about congratulations and the great things about being pregnant. googletag.cmd.push She said it made her smile and laugh but also that throughout her pregnancy she went from total joy to worry, worries about everything, all in the space of one day or even over a few minutes! So this week I thought I’d write a little bit about some of the worries you may have, to try to help you worry less… Worry one I think the main one is to stop worrying, it isn’t good for you, isn’t good for baby! Try to find a solution to that worry, find a way to ‘solve it’ and then ‘stop’ - think I’ve dealt with that so it’s a worry no more!     Worry two Baby development, of course you’ll be thinking every day how’s my baby growing, is she or he okay. The best advice here is go for your scans, look at your scan photo for reassurance, have extra scansthey make you feel reassured, talk to your midwe and follow her advice about diet, exercise, sleep etc AND relax! Worry three Giving birth - well baby is going to come out regardless of whether you worry so stop! You can though, plan what type of birth you would like, what pain relief you would like, what music you would like to listen to etc. But do also remember that he or she may decide to come early, that you can change your mind about pain relief and that as long as she or he arrives safely and you are both well that’s all that matters. Worry four Home or hospital - my niece wanted a water birth at home, till we found out about all the fuss with hose pipes, tap attachments, emptying the pool etc etc - so think carefully about what is best for you, your home, and your purse  Think, decide, be willing to change your mindbaby or you needs to and stop worrying, after all in the grand scheme of things as long as she or her arrives safely does it really matter! Worry five Germs, we’ve all had a really worrying year with the corona virus and it has made us all a bit overly conscious about germs. So being pregnant can amply this worry, but remember Mums have been pregnant for years, baby is protected in you and as long as your home is clean enough that’s all that matters. This means you do not have to clean everywhere every day! If you can, try to feed baby yourself at least for the first few days, evenyou express into a bottle, as this will help her immunity too. Worry six One of the biggest worries my niece had was who to have with her when it was time for baby to arrive. Of course she wanted baby’s dad there but then both their Mums, her Nan, her two Sisters and her Step Mum also wanted to be there, and all of them were asking consistently, giving so many reasons about why it should be them. I know my niece was completely stressed about this, I did feel like saying forget them just have me but of course I didn’t! I just said, just have Dad, tell everyone that this is what you want, just say no but thank you. Butthe time comes and you feel like you need one of them, for whatever reason decide then and there, not now, not today - but don’t tell them this otherwise it’s back to the me, me me, me please! Worry seven Telling your other child, don’t tell him or her too soon otherwise you will be tormented for nine months! Do explain that baby won’t be able to play - new siblings think ‘yes someone to play with’ and can be so disappointed when they realise baby can’t! Worry eight Feeding, there is a lot of pressure on new Mum’s to breast feed, but less information that says it’s okayyou can’t,it hurts too much, that you can’t because of the mediation you are taking,you aren’t producing enough milk etc. So from me, who experienced all this pressure and knows how harder it made it,you can’t don’t worry, just remember formula was designed for babies, enjoy feeding time, the snuggled up together, the closeness, after all that’s what matters the most! Worry nine The dog, the cat … of course you can’t get rid of Rover the dog, or Whiskers the cat, but you can adapt your home to help them prepare. Maybe they won’t be allowed on the couch or in the bedroom any more, maybe Rover will have to have two short walks a day instead of one long one, maybe you will buy a cat net for the pram or Moses basket, maybe you will buy a few new special toys for Rover for when you bring baby home. Just remember Rover and Whiskers will be curious, don’t leave them alone together for a while, don’t ignore them or this may cause jealousy after all before baby came did you not treat them like your baby! And remember millions of homes have babies and pets so providing you introduce them carefully and still give them lots of love there is no reason that won’t be your home either! Worry ten Worrying too much … yes you are so stop!ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  St Columbs College is celebrating the ,th anniversary of the birth of St Columba.Derry NewsFormer pupil to kick off Colleges Columban celebrations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The package was announced by the Executives Health Minister, Robin Swann. Mr Swann said the Department of Health has committed pound. million to support additional patient care through the winter. googletag.cmd.push A further pound. million will be spent to improve telephony infrastructure and improve accessibility, such as the use of online systems for ordering repeat prescriptions, helping to free up telephone lines and staff time. This is in addition to the pound. million already invested to upgrade GP systems to improve telephone access. Foyle MLA, Ms Ferguson, said that while the announcement from the Health Minister was to be welcomed, there was still more to be done. She said: “I welcome the announcement by the health minister of an extra pound. million to help improve people’s access to GP services. “This funding will be used to improve patient care and the telephone service offered by GP practices for people ordering prescriptions and over the phone consultations.     “People are having major dficulties getting GP appointments and it’s important that efforts are made to address this issue. “While this is an important step in supporting our under-pressure GP surgeries, much more needs to be done. “The health minister must come forward with his plan to roll out Multi-Disciplinary Teams to general practices so that pressure can be relieved on the GPs and the treatments that patients need can be provided in a timely manner.” Of the financial package that he has announced, the Health Minister Mr Swann said: “I recognise how important it is that people can access GP services when they need to do so. “I must emphasise that GP practices have been open throughout the pandemic and will continue to use both face-to-face appointments and alternative consultation options for patients as appropriate. “Feedback from GPs indicates that many patients are presenting with more complex needs, particularly those who have a chronic disease, making it more dficult for them to see all the people they would wish to.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.         Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.         The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.         Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps.     Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions  ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  St Columbs College is celebrating the ,th anniversary of the birth of St Columba.Derry NewsFormer pupil to kick off Colleges Columban celebrations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Oct Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Derry City  St. Patrick’s Athletic  Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe’s second half header was enough to earn Derry City their first win over St. Patrick’s Athletic at the fourth attempt this season. The striker struck midway through the second half to earn a big three points for the Candystripes in a dramatic encounter which saw both teams finish with  men. googletag.cmd.push Pat’s were on top for most of the game up until Junior’s goal, missing a series of chances in the first half alone. The visitors started the game on the front foot and almost got their reward when Sam Bone’s cross found Matty Smith, and his header beat Nathan Gartside but came back off the post. Matty Smith then missed when one on one with Gartside, before Chris Forrester hit the crossbar. It was City though who took the lead on  minutes. There seemed little on when substitute Jack Malone’s pass sent Jamie McGonigle racing down the right, but the striker produced a sensational cross right into the heart of the area for Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe, who simply had to nod City into a lead they had not been threatening.     The game exploded into drama on  minutes when Ronan Coughlan, on the pitch just  minutes, was red carded for elbowing Ciaran Coll. Danny Lafferty, already on a yellow card, was also sent off for his part in the melee which followed the elbow, with both team playing the final five minutes down to  men. Pat’s, still searching for an equaliser, came so close to a goal in the aftermath, but were denied by a brilliant double save from Gartside, who parried Matty Smith’s shot and then reacted to save from Benson as Derry survived again.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Oct Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Derry City  St. Patrick’s Athletic  Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe’s second half header was enough to earn Derry City their first win over St. Patrick’s Athletic at the fourth attempt this season. The striker struck midway through the second half to earn a big three points for the Candystripes in a dramatic encounter which saw both teams finish with  men. googletag.cmd.push Pat’s were on top for most of the game up until Junior’s goal, missing a series of chances in the first half alone. The visitors started the game on the front foot and almost got their reward when Sam Bone’s cross found Matty Smith, and his header beat Nathan Gartside but came back off the post. Matty Smith then missed when one on one with Gartside, before Chris Forrester hit the crossbar. It was City though who took the lead on  minutes. There seemed little on when substitute Jack Malone’s pass sent Jamie McGonigle racing down the right, but the striker produced a sensational cross right into the heart of the area for Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe, who simply had to nod City into a lead they had not been threatening.     The game exploded into drama on  minutes when Ronan Coughlan, on the pitch just  minutes, was red carded for elbowing Ciaran Coll. Danny Lafferty, already on a yellow card, was also sent off for his part in the melee which followed the elbow, with both team playing the final five minutes down to  men. Pat’s, still searching for an equaliser, came so close to a goal in the aftermath, but were denied by a brilliant double save from Gartside, who parried Matty Smith’s shot and then reacted to save from Benson as Derry survived again.

Conor has dabbled in open mike nights over the years with great feedback however found himself struggling to find the confidence to next the next step into the world of gigging. googletag.cmd.push However, after multiple lockdowns, playing his acoustic guitar within the confines of his home, he took plunge and into the world of gigging and hasn’t looked back since. Conor’s book is open for bookings for weekday and weekend slots throughout the Northwest Like most of us, Conor’s le grinded to a halt during COVID. Not being able to do the things he loved he decided once again to wipe the dust off his old guitar and give this singing thing a go. Luckily for Conor his work from home schedule at times wasn’t overly demanding so he found himself homing in on his guitar skills between meetings.     He credits both his music and his love of the outdoors for keeping his sanity throughout the winter lockdown of . A keen swimmer, Conor found himself using the cold water, taking regular dips in Enagh Lough throughout the week to stay present and focused, alleviating the worries and uncertainty that gripped the nation during COVID times. Coming out the far side Conor sees exciting times ahead for himself. “COVID had really made me realise that the most important thing in le is to do the things that really get me excited. “Le is short and tomorrow it could be gone, so don’t take anything for granted. “I’ve discovered my love for music and live performing and this is something I really want to peruse.

Fronted by Andrew Cameron-Braithwaite, they confidently wander the border between Indie Rock and Americana — sounding like a long overdue meeting of the minds of Pinegrove, Frightened Rabbit and Julien Baker AND THEY release “Where We All End Up In The End” on October . The album will be released in its entirety on Bandcamp on  October, followed by single releases on DSPs each month thereafter. To give listeners a taste of the album, smallmint will perform a streamed album launch gig on  October and release the fourth and final single ‘Pseudonym’ on DSPs on  October. I don’t know for sure but I’m going to say that DSPs are download streaming s. Hot Press have said The layered production, melodic guitar hooks and enthralling dynamics come together to form a striking and powerful sound and they know a thing or two. The Last Mixed Tape have said A well-crafted piece of songwriting, the bands sound moves dynamically with each twist in the song’s tail”, but I don’t believe they’re the actual last mixed tape and Chorblossom have predictably said Drenched in dreamy Americana vibes, Liv is a superb second single from smallmint, I’d love to see them rip into someone meself. ‘Where we all end up in the end’ began le in , when live tracking commenced at Smalltown America Studios in Derry. Smallmint worked closely together with producer Caolaacuten Austin to achieve the sound on the record. Frontman Andrew Cameron-Braithwaite wears his emotional intricacies on his sleeve through his vocal delivery and upfront lyricism, all set to a musical backdrop of crunchy electric guitars and pounding drums. The result is a confident statement of intent — a testament to the band’s hard work, musicianship, and their own high standards. He said: “We wanted the album to feel natural and to actually sound like a band playing live in a room, which is exactly how it was recorded. It was important for us to keep that space and energy in the recordings - no need for overproduction or too many overdubs, we wanted to let the arrangement of the music by the band, and the lyrics speak for themselves.” Check them out on facebook smallmintband or instagram smallmintband or even www  smallmintbandADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Katrina Rainey died from her injuries after being found in a burning car last week.Local NewsDefendant in County Derry murder at risk of self-harm, court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsMan arrested after fight at County Derry roundabout overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th October,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  St Columbs College is celebrating the ,th anniversary of the birth of St Columba.Derry NewsFormer pupil to kick off Colleges Columban celebrations overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  The Randalstown to Castledawson section of the A opened earlier this year.BusinessMajor awards success for flagship A dualling scheme overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId   reported missing  times - court told\" title\"Derry girlsreported missing  times - court told\" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"Derry NewsDerry girlreported missing  times - court told overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at Sugar Nightclub Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Fancy Dress night out with Moyola FC, Castledawson  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Memory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a trip through the archives of the Derry News  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at The Strand Bar Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

The popular festival which usually takes place in Co. Clare every September, was cancelled for the second year in a row due to the pandemic. The cancellations were described as a devastating blow for local businesses as the event draws large crowds from all over Ireland, and abroad, to the North Clare town. googletag.cmd.push  Organisers decided to take the festival to Cabo Roig, a small town in the Alicante region, and despite the change in location, veteran matchmaker Willie Daly promises that love will definitely still be in the air. I dont know quite what to expect, but itll be wonderful to bring Lisdoonna over there. Id imagine the Spanish fellas, with their Latin blood, will be a bit more forward than the Irish lads. Irish lads tend to be shy, and only get going once theyve a rake of pints inside them.

at half time.Downpatrick were desperately unlucky not to find the back of the net just minutes into the second half,as McGrady ran clear of the defenders after a looping ball over the topseemed to have caught Clonduff napping.With lsquokeeper Gribben already off his line, he made the decision to challenge McGrady in an aerial dual that the Downpatrick number  managed to win.However, his slapped effort over the head of the Clonduff custodian clipped back off the post and backinto the possession of the grateful Yellas.A minute later and the Hoops were back threatening the opposition defence, but Clonduff held firm when Branniganrsquos lsquorsquo effort dropped into the danger zone.Barry OrsquoHagan punished the Hoops for not taking their chances as his free sailed over the bar, before Downpatrickrsquos Oran Cunningham saw his effort drt wide at the other end.Charlie Carr extended his sidersquos lead with his second point of the game, although Tim Prenter managed to keep the RGU in touch with a no-nonsense score.McConville restored the margin with a left footed strike before his free pushed his side further in front.Darren OrsquoHagan showed no signs of slowing down as he began bossing play with piercing runs and cute passing, allowing the Yellas to put a foothold on the game.Doherty saw his free drt wide off the mark before Close punished the Hoops with a finely taken point to close out the action before the second water-break.Downpatrick knew the clock was against them, but they werenrsquot quite at panic station yet, as Brannigan converted yet another free after teammate Sean Bell was fouled.Clonduff midfielder Ross Carr pointed immediately after before Brannigan once more replied with a free.However, Darren OrsquoHagan began the move that would decide the match, after a string of neat passes and clever off the ball movement allowed his brother Barry to nip in behind the Downpatrick defence before calmly slotting home into the bottom right corner.The now six-point advantage truly seemed to deflate the Downpatrick side who now knew it would take something very special to force extra-time.Despite a Brannigan free, McConville wrapped up the scoring with a lovely left footed strike to ensure it was his Clonduff outfit who would enter the semi-final draw.This signalled the end of the road for the Downpatrick men, who gave a great account of themselves in this yearrsquos competition.Downpatrick: J Deeny, E Rooney , A Doherty, R Murphy, S Bell, J Bell, C Doherty , D Turley, C McCarron, T Prenter , G Collins, C McGrady , J Brannigan , O Cunningham, C Mooney.Subs: T Smyth, P Turley, A Og Robinson, M Fitzpatrick, T Louden, T McNeill, N Cunningham, D Brannf, T Savage, C Boyd, R Og Quinn, C Farrell, G Trainor.Clonduff: P Gribben, J OrsquoHagan, D OrsquoHagan, T McEvoy, L Branagan, C Carr , J Gribben, R Carr, A Carr , T Close , P OrsquoHagan, B OrsquoHagan , A McConville , S McConville, E Brown.Subs: N Trainor, C Brown, R Brannigan, S McGreevy, P Lively, R Lively, T McGreevy, B McConville, P Wilson, J Boden, M McPolin, K OrsquoHagan, F McConville..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Co.jpg","title":"Co Down Rural Community opens new hub in Newcastle  ","story":"THE Co Down Rural Community Network has opened a new wellbeing hub in Newcastle.The new facility is intended to be a central point in the resort to make it easier for people to access information, advice and support and participate in activities to improve their mental and physical health and wellbeing.It will work with iniduals, community members, local groups, and multi-disciplinary teamsto identy community needs and facilitate better access to mental health and wellbeing training and resources.The opening of the new hub is the culmination of the Community Network working with local GPs and primary care teams and the wider community for over  years.Over the past three years, the network has linked up with the MDTs in the local primary care practices.The network has a team of social prescribers and an MDT coordinator who take referrals from GP practices, pharmacists and from other sources and find solutions for people who may be affected by physical limitations or mental health issues or who simply feel isolated in their own homes.This work has intensied during the Covid pandemic, making the opening of the hub even more timely.A total of  people have been referred by the local GPs and their teams to the Community Network since January this year in addition to the  clients that the Social Prescribing team have been working with since .Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairwoman Cathy Mason, who officially opened the news hub on Monday, has described it as a ldquogreat asset for the Community Network team and those who formerly operated a connect and chat service.ldquoGroups of all sorts now have a base to operate from in a beautul and peaceful location.

The project manager Mr Mike Gibb, said Delamont had always been his first option but he could no longer afford to wait on the council.Mr Gibbrsquos announcement dashes hopes that the centre, which is destined to become the largest owl and birds of prey rescue facility in Europe, would come to Killyleagh.Mr Gibb had entered negotiations with Down Council last year regarding the possible construction of the sanctuary at Delamont.But the project became the subject of controversial debates within the council chamber earlier this year amid accusations that council officials were dragging their heels about the proposal, leading Mr Gibb to look for alternative locations.CLOUGH ndash Residents opposing plans for the erection of a BT Cellnet mobile telephone mast in Clough have formed an action group to try and block the plan.At a meeting in the village on Monday, residents got together after they heard local environmentalist, Walter Graham, outlined the drawbacks and health risks associated with these masts.Plans for the -metre mast which,approved, will be sited within the Watsonrsquos filling station complex, were published several weeks ago andaccepted could be operating within months.Up to  residents gathered in the Old School House, just a stonersquos throw from the proposed site, to hear of the risks and implications these masts are believed to cause.Villagers heard how the transmitter could dominate the skyline, towering over homes, a primary school, petrol station and an old peoplersquos home.Claiming that scientists believed the growth of cancers were ldquospurred on by the transmitters, he said. ldquoIf this mast goes up my children are coming out of school, there is no way they will study in the shadow of that mast. Most of the children in that school live very close to the mast site and the consequences will be disastrousthey have to live and study under it, he said.DARRAGH CROSS ndash A Planning Service decision to refuse permission for a new filling station and shop in Darragh Cross has been strongly criticised by a local councillor.Miss Margaret Ritchie said the decision not to grant planning permission to Mr J C Flanagan for the development near the junction of the Darragh and Manse roads, showed a ldquocomplete lack of common sense.Planners gave four reasons for refusing the development which would have been the villagersquos first purpose-built shop.It was ruled that the site was in a countryside area and on a minor road and because no special circumstances were demonstrated, a relaxation of the planning controls would not be allowed.Planners also pointed out the development site is within the Belfast green belt area and is outside the development limits for Darragh Cross.DUNDRUM ndash Pupils at Sacred Heart Primary School in Dundrum are enjoying the benefits of an exciting environmental project thanks to the efforts of the Mourne Heritage Trust and the Princersquos Trust.Volunteers from both organisations were at the school recently to build a wildle pond and insect garden and also plant shrubs.Mr Gerry Carey, Princersquos Trust team leader, thanked the Mourne Heritage Trust for assisting and supervising the volunteers and for providing equipment to carry out the project.He also thanked Mr Patrick McParland, school principal, for his hospitality during the week.Mr McParland expressed his delight at the work carried out by the Princersquos Trust and also thanked the ranger and countryside team from the Mourne Heritage Trust for their help throughout the project.BALLYNAHINCH ndash A colourful ballon launch in Ballynahinch yesterday marked a vital step forward for children with speech and language dficulties.Education charity, I-CAN, officially threw open the doors of its first pioneering centre in Northern Ireland, at Ballynahinch Primary School, to provide the best start in le for children who have problems communicating.Laughter rang out from the bright classroom where three and four year-olds, who would otherwise start primary school unable to communicate, read or write, were having fun and learning together in the colourful new suite.The children who would normally feel frustrated, isolated or unconfident because they cannot communicate, are helped by a speech and language therapist, nursery teacher and classroom assistant, who work together to assess, plan and work with the children.STRANGFORD ndash Crew members on the Strangford ferry have reacted angrily to news that the Roads Service may privatise the servicersquos workforce.The government is interested in the idea of public private partnership and is studying the market to see how effective it would bethe crew was transferred to the private sector.However, the ferryrsquos employees are adamant that this would be the wrong move saying their interests would be overlooked in a private ownerrsquos quest for profit.They are also worried that there may be job losses and other cutbacks which could lead to an inadequate service for passengers.A spokesman for the crew said all employees object to the idea of privatisation adding they have all been kept in the dark about what the government is proposing to do.Around  people work on the ferry on a daily basis and he said that everyone is worried that the rights they have fought for over the years will be eroded by a private owner.Some of the staff have worked on the ferry for over  years and all are concerned that a private owner will only be interested in money and will not be able to retain the current conditionsldquoWe have all been kept in the dark about what is happening.

She also highlighted the key role of the local resilience group which was established.She added: ldquoThe most important thing now is once this scheme is complete, some  homes in Newcastle will be protected against future flooding..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Downe.jpg","title":"Downe must play key role  ","story":"HEALTH chiefs have this week been urged to signicantly enhance the role of the Downe Hospital.They are being asked to build a new extension to allow the building to play an increasingly important role in the delivery of healthcare.The Down Community Health Committee has also appealed to the South Eastern Trust to accelerate theprocess of restoring all pre-Covid services to the Downpatrick hospital and ensure that this is one of theorganisationrsquos top priorities.The call comes after it was confirmed that a number of planned operations at the Downe have been cancelled over recent weeks to allow staff to be redeployed to the intensive care unit at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald.Nineteen months after the local hospitalrsquos emergency department was closed temporarily as partof the health trustrsquos Covid emergency response, campaigners say it is now time for the key service to .They say that while the creation of a daytime only urgent care centre as an interim measure on the road to the restoration of the full emergency department services was welcome, the needs of the community have been clearly demonstrated and that the Downersquos previous ED must be restored.Community Health Committee chairman, Mr Eamonn McGrady, said the health trustrsquos position on emergency care for the entire East Down area, from Strangford to Newcastle and beyond, ldquois not appropriate.He declared: ldquoThe dire situation fails to meet the needs of the local community and the model of care was changed in an emergency, without the opportunity for due scrutiny and consultation with the local community. That was understandable in March , but needs to be addressed now.ldquoThe simple inadequacy of the emergency ambulance response times in this area is also a matter of grave concern. We recognise that a major element in that service failure is the y ambulance handover times that can occur at the hospitals with the centralised services.ldquoThat was to be dealt with under the Department of Healthrsquos ldquoNo More Silos document, published a full year ago. Why has that still not been addressed  he asked.Veteran hospital campaigner, Ann Trainor, has welcomed news in a letter from health officials that they are ldquoactively working on improving so-called point of care testingcapability at the Downe Hospital, which should signicantly increase service delivery in the urgent care centre.ldquoThis is good news, she continued. ldquoWe hope that progress on this will be very swt and perhaps the South Eastern Trust could explain why we are still waiting on an MRI scanner at the Downe too ldquoHoneyed words wonrsquot increase the diagnostic capability of our local hospital, one which has so much to offer on a regional basis too, but swt action will. The Trust told us recently that the urgent care centre is lsquomeeting the needs of the publicrsquo but one really has to wonder how this opinion has been formed, said Mrs Trainor.Appealing for increased investment at the Downe site, health campaigners say that the hospital has the capability to do much more.The say the hospitalrsquos bed capacity must be extended to help meet the needs of local communities but also to help address the regional beds shortage caused by the large cut in capacity across Northern Ireland ldquowhich has been brutally exposed during the Covid crisis.The campaigners added: ldquoThe South Eastern Trust should now be looking at a large extension to the hospital, creating new capacity, away from over congested centralised sites, levelling up rural inequality in healthcare provision. That work must be done now and urgently and hand-in-hand with the creation of new medical workforce capacity.ldquoIt is time to build for the future and it is time for all the political parties to vigorously pursue this new investment for the Downe, the peoplersquos hospital. The people expect politicians to deliver and deliver now.A South Eastern Trust spokeswoman confirmed that due to the pressures of Covid-, a small number of theatre lists at the Downe Hospital had to be cancelled in the past two weeks in order to provide staff support in the Intensive Care Unit at the Ulster Hospital.ldquoPatients who unfortunately had their procedures postponed have been rescheduled or have already had their procedures at another site in the South Eastern Trust area, she confirmed.The spokeswoman said a normal theatre schedule will resume as soon as possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Arts.jpg","title":"Downpatrick Arts Society event in St Patrick Centre  ","story":"LADY Margaret Ritchie joined members of Downpatrick Art Society as the grouprsquos st exhibition got underway at the St Patrickrsquos Centre.Over  paintings are on show encompassing a range of styles and themes, with many of the works inspired by local landscapes, while other paintings have stories to tell.Other paintings depict faraway shores to dream about and there are a few abstract works too ndash so therersquos something for everyone.The exhibition allows the artists to share their joy of painting with the public and indeed many of the paintings can be purchased to be enjoyed at home or as a gt for someone.The Society began over  years ago with four founding members and has continued to flourish as this yearrsquos exhibition proves.Prior to the Covid- lockdown, the Society enjoyed demonstrations and critiques by professional artists as well as outings and social activities and it is hoped toto these activities as the restrictions ease.Those who love painting or drawing and would like to join the Art Society should call    or leave their contact details at the reception desk in the St Patrickrsquos Centre.The new exhibition runs until the end of October between am and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13October2021_Park.jpg","title":"East Down runners enjoy Castlewellan parkrun fun  ","story":"AFTER the huge efforts at the ious marathons last weekend, many runners were justiably taking their ease this weekend so it made for a quiet weekend on the racing front.Some East Down AC members saw this as a good opportunity to stay close to home by taking part in the Castlewellan parkrun.This is a free weekly K timed run and anyone can take part whether they belong to a club or not.If you want to appear in the results you must first obtain a bar code online at https:www.parkrun.org.uk register  and then turn up in good time for the .am start.There are around  dferent parkrun locations in Northern Ireland with new events being set up all the time.Castlewellan can claim to be one of the most scenic and it attracted  plus participants on Saturday past and whether the EDAC runners enjoyed their morning exercise or the post run refreshments more is up for debate.Ollie Robinson was first EDAC runner home possibly to ensure he had the pick of the goodies, while others were happy to run easy while taking in the beauty of the lake and trail.As promised there was ample coffee and homemade cake at the finish for our club runners and we were more than happy to share with other passers by.We may even have acquired the odd new member or two so all in all it was a successful day out. The idea is to visit a iety of locations in the months ahead.At the same time as some were having a leisurely lsquocupparsquo, three EDAC members had donned their red and yellow vests ready to take on the Cooley Coast K in Carlingford.Patrick Smith reported back that the weather was kind, the first eight kilometres was gentle and almost flat, but the last two gave them their moneyrsquos worth with a steady climb back to the finish line at the Cooley Kickhamrsquos GAC grounds.He managed to complete it in a time of .which put him in well inside the top half of the field of .Kelly Smith was ahead of him up the road as she stormed to a . which took a full minute off her previous best time.She was fth female overall which should really boost her confidence to no end.

Well done Kelly.Aine Grant who has settled in well to the club was doing her first K since Jimmyrsquos Ten in June and was well pleased to finish in  minutes. They all said that they would recommend this as a race to others in the club.Aaron McGrady had another good day on the hills on Saturday. He seems to flourish when there is hardship.He was out wearing his EDAC vest with pride at the Bradwell Fell Race in the centre of the Peak District.Not an easy one as it comprises eight kilometres and m of climbing with a profile of three steep climbs early in the race, a rolling circuit for a few km on the fell top and then a final steepdescent to the village.The conditions on Saturday were misty and cool on the tops but good for running and helped by a well marked course.The race set off fast into the first climb and Aaron settled back in and around tenth, hoping to work his way forward on the climbs.Over the top of the first climb, there were three main contenders with Aaron one of them.He took the lead on the way over the second climb and managed to put in a hard burst over the top and down the second descent.When he couldnrsquot hear the sound of the others breathing, he knew he had created a good gap so he relaxed a little on the third climb to gather some energy for the loop on the top.He was reasonably confident that he had built about a  second lead when he reached the final descent, but he gave it a good rattle anyway crossing the finish line with well over a minute to spare.Great pacing and a pleasing result.This weekend sees the Cross Country season taking the headlines with the NI Mastersrsquo Trials at Queenrsquos Playing Fields.Entries for this are now closed but those who are taking part will be vying for selection for the upcoming Home Countries event in November.Plenty of others will also be planning some off road training in order to prepare for the Bobby Rea XC which is the week after.It is great to see some recent recruits adding their name to the team entry and hopefully they will enjoy their first experience of lsquothe muckrsquo.

Concerns came not just from across the political spectrum but from groups including the Rural Community Network.”He added: “I am glad Nichola Mallon has taken this action, eventhe problem should never have arisen in the first place.”Sinn Fein MLA Cathal Boylan, meanwhile, have also welcomed the u-turn.“This was the right decision as the Minister’s plan was clearly out of step with the needs for rural communities,” he said.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

But I recall from that brief exchange how charming and polite he was, and how humble in the face of a mereconstituent.Much later I interviewed Mr Amess in the Westminster area, albeit briefly. I think this happened twice, when I was doing surveys of Tory MPs and their attitudes to the  Obama-McCain US presidential election and later in the run up to the  Brexit vote.I am not sure where one of those encounters happened — I think I approached him as he was walking in the street along the side of the House of Lords — but I have a clear recollection that he was smiling, as he had been in .He always seemed to be smiling.This might sound like typical praise of someone after they have died but it isn’t.

These burrows were once part of a huge dune system that stretched all the way from the River Ogmore to the Gower peninsula and this area along with Kenfig is classed as a Site of Special Scientic Interest.With the dogs racing ahead enjoying their adventure and freedom, the narrow sandy paths adorned in places by the pretty Michaelmas-daisy led them through the burrows before turning southwards towards the coast.Reaching Kenfig Sands where the tide was on the ebb there were fantastic views south westwards towards Jersey Marine, Swansea Bay, Mumbles and Gower beyond as they settled down utilising washed up tree trunks as seating for morning refreshments in warm sunshine with a welcome breeze.Returning onto the coast path above the beach the group made their way eastwards to reach Sker Point with its fantastic long-distance views back across Kenfig Sands, spoiled only by the industrial smoke and buildings of Port Talbot Steelworks.Following the coastline soon the yellow painted Sker House came into view which signalled their lunch stop overlooking Sker Rocks which was the setting on April , , when the Samtampa a former Liberty ship was making its way up the Bristol Channel towards Newport in a south westerly gale. Developing an engine fault, the captain dropped anchor so repairs could begin, but the weather worsened to hurricane force winds, the ship slipped its anchor and was driven onto Sker Rocks. Mumbles leboat was launched to try to save the crew, but the Samtampa began to break up and all  of its crew drowned, along with the eight volunteer crew members of the Mumbles leboat which was later found upside down and smashed to pieces.     Continuing along the coast path with views across Rest Bay to Locks Common in Porthcawl and reaching the western perimeter of the Royal Porthcawl Golf Club, they ventured inland following a narrow path between fences, with a field of beautul Welsh Black cattle as the heat rose, before an open field brought them through a gate into Nottage.A short journey along the busy and fast-moving West Road brought them to a rough track opposite Parc Newydd Farm, which led them to overlook the impressive, imposing and dramatic Grade One listed Sker House, which was originally founded by the Cistercian monks of Neath as one of five farms or granges to support Neath Abbey. The house was remodelled by the Turberville family in the mid-th century after which it was tenanted and then sold to the Williams family in the late th century.This was when the romantic, heart rendering story of the lsquoMaid of Skerrsquo began involving Elizabeth Williams, an attractive young lady who loved to dance in the old Town Hall above the Prince of Wales Inn at Kenfig, where the music was supplied by a harpist.One evening the harpist was Thomas Evans and upon meeting they were smitten and fell in love.

With all things considered, officers recommended the delivery of option two.The rural towns officers included in the report are Donaghcloney, Keady, Richhill, Tandragee and Waringstown.DUP group leader, Councillor Mark Baxter proposed the officers’ recommendation to go with the festive drive in experience and said “it would be very welcome, especially in those rural communities”.Councillor Paul Berry welcomed the proposal but noted Markethill was not included in the list of towns mentioned and proposed it was included.Council’s head of economic development services, Nicola Wilson confirmed Markethill could be includedcouncillors want.Noting Council has a duty of care to the general public, Councillor Kyle Savage seconded the proposal to accept the recommendation and praised council officersfor “taking and showing true leadership” with this recommendation.Noting he was happy to go with the proposal for the festive drive-in, despite public health regulations relaxing further at the end of October, Councillor Sam Nicholson said he would second Cllr Berry’s proposal to include Markethill in the proposal.“I support Cllr Berry’s call to include Markethill. It is one of our most thriving and vibrant market towns,” he said.“If Councillor Berry is making a proposal to include it, I am happy to second it.”Alderman Ian Burns said he was fully supportive of the proposal but called for the towns of Gilford and Rathfriland to also be recognised.Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon said he would prefer to see twilight markets in the rural towns but with the movie night proposal he would want to ensure that “providing it can be worked into costs, it is run in as many of our rural towns as possible”.Alderman Jim Speers said he had discussed this issue “at ” with Council officers and acknowledged the need for as many places as possible to get an event like this.“I am very supportive of the need to have this event in Markethill butwe do that in one place other towns will feel they have been short-changed.“I have already had that conversation with officers and I would like to see us get to the point where this is rolled out across the area.”The committee then voiced its approval for Councillor Baxter’s proposal to recommend the movie night and free Christmas Eve car parking is approved and Cllr Berry’s proposal to incorporate as many smaller towns as budgets will allow.Read this:- Driving tests ‘crisis’Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

student accommodation ","story":"With freshers week around the corner and thousands of young people in Northern Ireland set to start University or new career paths, many will be on the hunt for rented accommodation. Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
