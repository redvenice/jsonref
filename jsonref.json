Now two exhibitions celebrate his subversive brillianceIn 1977, at the Hansa studio in West Berlin, David Bowie was recording some new songs when he happened to look out of the window. The pop legend saw his musical collaborator Tony Visconti kissing his girlfriend in front of the heavily guarded concrete barrier built by communist East Germany to keep its citizens in. He wrote “Heroes”, one of his best loved songs, that contains the lines: “I, I can remember  Standing by the wall  And the guns shot above our heads  And we kissed as though nothing could fall.”But Bowie wasn’t the first person to juxtapose totalitarian brutality and the frailty of the inidual in a modern masterpiece called Heroes. A decade earlier, as the cold war began to intensify, a young German artist named Hans-Georg Kern painted a series of ironic paintings also collectively titled Heroes. They turn the happy smiling people who featured on propaganda posters of the time into bleeding, dismembered figures of pathos and tragicomedy. This September, both the early rage and the latest work of this great artist can be seen in two London exhibitions.Kern came from a town called Deutschbaselitz in Saxony, eastern Germany. Born in 1938, he spent the first seven years of his life under the Nazi regime, which claimed it was creating a “New Order”. He saw it differently. “I was born into a destroyed order,” he said.In 1945, the Red Army overwhelmed Saxony, and Kern found himself exchanging a far-right dictatorship for a Stalinist one. At first, he was a true socialist believer. But in 1957, he was expelled from the Academy of Fine and Applied Arts in East Berlin for “sociopolitical immaturity”. The Berlin Wall would not be built until 1961. To change his life, all he had to do was cross over to the city’s small western enclave and enrol in its art college.When the wall went up, he renamed himself Georg Baselitz after his birthplace and started showing savage, obscene art that scandalised a city you might have thought was unshockable. In Big Night Down the Drain, finished in 1963, a boy with a massive head stands naked except for a pair of unzipped green-grey shorts, holding his erect purple penis – epitomising, surely, the “sociopolitical immaturity” of which he had been accused.The work’s power to offend crossed ideological barriers: it was seized by West Berlin police on suspicion of “obscenity” and “immorality”. But Baselitz knew exactly what he was doing. He was taking on Germany’s modern history as no artist had done before. The boy holding his penis looks like he might be off hiding in the woods when he’s supposed to be doing drill at a totalitarian youth camp. His shorts seem part of a militaristic uniform, the Hitler Youth or the Communist Pioneers, perhaps. Whatever the uniform, he’d rather be masturbating.Baselitz makes his view of German history still more explicit in his 1965 work Painting for the Fathers, one of the highlights in a new survey of his art at the Michael Werner Gallery in London and one of his first Heroes paintings. It is far from most people’s idea of the heroic, though. A figure with a huge arm and tiny head emerges ghostlike from a florid mass of fleshy bulges and exposed intestines spread out amid thorny undergrowth, with a vertical penis forming a kind of spire. This is the world the 1940s fathers made: chaos in the name of “order”, mass murder in the name of “purity”, sprawling shame in the name of “Heroes”.Other figures in the Heroes series at least manage to stand up. Two Meissen Woodsmen, from 1967, shows uniformed men setting dogs on, well, who? One of the hounds hangs from a branch with the rear part of its body missing even as it pants for blood. On closer inspection, the soldiers also appear to lack legs even as they stand in their eastern front greatcoats.In these paintings of supposed heroes, Baselitz is painting the Nazi world into which he was born. In 1965, Gerhard Richter, who had also escaped from east to west, painted an eerie photorealist portrait of his Uncle Rudi in Nazi uniform. Baselitz, however, was making a far more visceral attack on history, pulling out its innards and unzipping its trousers. Indeed, open flies are a recurring trait of his Heroes. In Three Farm Labourers, from 1967, one man in military shorts has his penis dangling between his legs.Is he a Nazi? Baselitz’s Heroes series unequivocally draws parallels between the two totalitarian systems he knew at first-hand. Communist propaganda is travestied in these grotesque satires. The man in shorts is embraced by a hefty figure in overalls. Is this a Soviet hero worker? Could this be an unholy meeting of dictatorships? At their feet, weird roots clutch. In the background, a third worker bends in backbreaking work. The people suffer whichever party prevails.The greatness of Baselitz’s early art goes beyond obvious ironies. It lies in a reckoning with 20th-century perversions of art itself. Nazism and Stalinism had one thing in common: they insisted on clearly understandable figurative art. In 1937, the Third Reich held up confiscated modernist art to ridicule, in its Degenerate Art exhibition. Similarly, in 1932, socialist realism became the official art of the Soviet Union and, after 1945, its satellites including East Germany.Baselitz does not merely parody totalitarian realism. He infects it with its opposite. These paintings are the revenge of degenerate art. The gooey, luscious collapse of form into formlessness in Painting for the Fathers is perversely decadent. The heroic has truly gone to seed.So far, so dadaist. Yet Baselitz paints not to destroy art history but save it. He was inspired to paint Heroes by a revelatory visit to Italy. In 1965, he went to Florence on a scholarship and was blown away by its art. Specifically, he fell in love with mannerism, a 16th-century style that rejected the harmony and proportion of earlier Renaissance art in favour of distortion and disorder. All of the long limbs, big hands and tiny heads of Baselitz’s Heroes consciously remake Renaissance mannerism as cutting-edge contemporary art.This is why they stand at the very centre of postwar Germany’s artistic rebirth. It might be difficult to understand why German art burst so powerfully out of the ashes of 1945 to become the greatest in Europe today. It has to do with a courage and audacity in acknowledging history – and in refusing to let the dead hands of Hitler and Erich Honecker, the leader of East Germany from 1971, close off the resources, the giants, of the German past. Like Joseph Beuys resurrecting ancient mythology and Anselm Kiefer reclaiming Romanticism, Baselitz took a past tainted by Nazis – and Stalinists – and made it new. There’s nothing, his Heroes reveal, so subversively degenerate as painting the human body.Since the 1960s Baselitz has spent his life looking at the human form with impassioned and quizzical eyes, turning people upside down, carving crude totemic figures out of wood, and in his most recent works expressing the anguish of old age in brutally real images of physical decay. While the Michael Werner Gallery returns to his artistic roots this September, his latest paintings and sculptures are revealed at White Cube. They depict thin, timeworn, almost mummified hands. The hands of an artist who rescued the human pulse from the forces that would efface it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/871df93433a0b6813abd3687e401f96b44ceef9f/0_16_1500_901/master/1500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=b7915f2a475b9a60a68827686ca215c2","title":"businesses and customers share your experiences of eat out to help out","story":"We’d like to hear to from staff, owners and customers on how they feel the scheme has beenThe government’s ‘eat out to help out’ scheme has meant more than 64m meals have been claimed since the beginning of August.When introduced, its aim was to incentivise the public to dine at restaurants by allowing customers to claim a half-price discount up to a cost of £10.

Instead, it will be able to stimulate activity for longer in order to create jobs.Financial markets responded to Powell’s widely expected comments. The Dow Jones industrial average turned positive for 2020 for the first time since March, while the S\u0026ampP and Nasdaq indices hit new peaks.He added: “Our revised statement reflects our appreciation for the benefits of a strong labour market, particularly for many in low- and moderate-income communities, and that a robust job market can be sustained without causing an unwelcome increase in inflation.”Candice Bangsund, vice president and portfolio manager at Fiera Capital, said: “This more relaxed view on inflation will reinforce the notion that rates will remain pinned at these rock-bottom levels for an extended time – which will be instrumental in guiding the economy back to health and acting as a key source of support for risky assets in general.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3811e76bdbaee9651fc74e03ff890fddc86cd7aa/0_49_1300_779/master/1300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=742edff24084090df501ce1744244c39","title":"woman sues easyjet after being told to move seats due to ultra orthodox jewish men","story":"Melanie Wolfson was asked to move twice because men refused to sit next to a female A British-Israeli woman is suing easyJet after the low-cost airline asked her to move seats on a flight from Tel Aviv to London following objections from strictly-Orthodox Jewish men who refused to sit next to a female passenger.Melanie Wolfson, 38, is claiming 66,438 shekels (almost £15,000) compensation in a lawsuit filed on her behalf by the Israel Religious Action Center (IRAC), which won a similar case in 2017 brought against El Al, the Israeli national carrier.Wolfson, a professional fundraiser who moved to Israel 13 years ago and lives in Tel Aviv, is also asking that easyJet bans its cabin crew from asking women to switch seats because of their gender.According to the lawsuit, Wolfson paid extra for an aisle seat on her flight last October. A strictly-Orthodox man and his son, who were sitting in the row when she arrived, asked Wolfson to switch seats with a man a few rows ahead.Wolfson says she was “insulted and humiliated” by the request. “It was the first time in my adult life that I was discriminated against for being a woman,” she told Haaretz.“I would not have had any problem whatsoever switching seats if it were to allow members of a family or friends to sit together, but the fact that I was being asked to do this because I was a woman was why I refused.”A flight attendant intervened and offered Wolfson a free hot drink as an incentive to move. Concerned that the flight might be delayed on her account and feeling that she had little choice in the matter, she agreed to switch seats. “There were passengers watching this happen who said nothing,” she said.According to the suit, several flight attendants told Wolfson during the flight that women were often asked to switch seats in order to accommodate strictly-Orthodox men.Two months later, on another easyJet flight to London, Wolfson was again asked to move seats by two strictly-Orthodox men. She refused their request but two female passengers agreed to change seats with the two men sitting next to her.Members of the cabin crew did not intervene or try to defend her right to stay seated where she was although again she was offered a free hot drink, according to the suit.Wolfson complained to the airline on both occasions but when it failed to respond, she decided to sue for violation of Israeli law, which prohibits discrimination against customers on the basis of race, religion, nationality, land of origin, gender, sexual orientation, political views or personal status.Although easyJet is not based in Israel, lawyers will argue that the airline was subject to Israeli law while its plane was on the ground at Ben-Gurion airport, where the incident took place.In a statement, easyJet said: “We take claims of this nature very seriously. Whilst it would be inappropriate to comment, as this matter is currently the subject of legal proceedings, we do not discriminate on any grounds.”Three years ago, Renee Rabinowitz, an 82-year-old Holocaust survivor, won a landmark ruling against El Al. The Israeli judge hearing the case said that “under absolutely no circumstances can a crew member ask a passenger to move from their designated seat because the adjacent passenger doesn’t want to sit next to them due to their gender”.At the time, IRAC said almost 7,500 emails had been sent to El Al by members of the public objecting to requests made to female passengers to change seats."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e38967f30607bbeeb13f8572c85c1fc696dbe62/0_201_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db630142ed70a794ae54c33ad1ca96e2","title":"wpp reveals only 3 of uk staff regularly work from office","story":"Figures highlight numbers still working from home during coronavirus pandemicThe world’s biggest employer in the marketing and advertising sector, which has clients ning Ford to Facebook, has a workforce of about 10,000 in the UK.WPP revealed on Wednesday that just 300 staff are working in its British offices, as the company takes a cautious approach to health and safety and embraces the homeworking revolution.The new data underscore the challenge facing Boris Johnson, who is desperate to get people back to work to help reignite spending in towns and cities.“The costs of office closures are becoming clearer by the day,” said Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry. “Some of our busiest city centres resemble ghost towns, missing the usual bustle of passing trade.

The online grocer, remarkably, is three times the size of the engine-maker these days by stock market capitalisation, and the share-incentive prospects at his new home will be better to boot.The timing of Stephen Daintith’s exit will irritate Rolls’ shareholders but it was not the main event amid another set of bleak figures. That was the “severe but plausible downside scenario” that sketched out Rolls’ predicament if a second wave of Covid-19 infections forces more lockdowns and further restrictions on air travel.In short, the picture would be ugly. Orders for new engines from Airbus and Boeing would fall even further, and Rolls’ revenues from maintaining engines already in service (a vital source of income) would suffer another whack.That is compared with a backdrop that is already poor: Rolls suffered a £2.8bn outflow in the first six months of this year, with the tally expected to reach £4bn by the end of December. It is why the share price sits close to a 10-year low and Rolls’ debt is rated as junk.The small consolation for shareholders is that “severe” should not mean catastrophic. As things stand today, Rolls still has some room to borrow and it can improve its balance sheet by selling £2bn of assets, including its Spanish business ITP Aero, which makes blades and parts for engines. In all likelihood it will also try to raise a further £2bn-ish from shareholders.If the severe situation occurs, it would have to put even more businesses on the block – the German power systems unit would be a candidate. That would be a desperate option, but there is, in theory, a way for Rolls to muddle through.By the time 2022 arrives it will have shrunk its civil aviation ision by a third (at the cost of 8,000 jobs). In the meantime, the defence business is a source of relative calm. The government should worry about Rolls, but not panic – or at least not yet.The Hut Group is a retail and marketing business in need of sharper copywriters. The company’s description of its most interesting ision – a “unique and proprietary end-to-end e-commerce technology and operating ecosystem” – is a mouthful. Translated, it means Hut thinks it can shift a lot of goods online, for itself and others, while steering clear of Amazon.The Manchester-based firm also has an impressive collection of big-name consumer companies on its platform. Nestlé, Procter \u0026amp Gamble, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Coca-Cola presumably all feel curious, or fearful, about the direct-to-consumer world of social media influencers. Hut’s challenge will be to keep the brands onboard when their owners feel less baffled and ready to do their own thing.The hardest part, though, is believing Hut is worth £4.5bn today, which is the aim for the flotation. At that level, the business would be valued at roughly 40 times last year’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of £111m. But even that princely multiple understates things: include depreciation and amortisation, as one should, and Hut’s operating profits were just £30m in 2019.Moulding deserves applause for listing Hut in London, rather on the Nasdaq in the US, but loyalty to the UK will count for little if the promised rate of revenue growth falters. At £4.5bn, Hut has a lot to prove."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f580b3055b6ba47246a412b9a04e87b3a2f4e6a/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=317f417f72ff912829574e56ac83b303","title":"closing childrens centres opposite levelling up","story":"As a Conservative council closes yet more services, it’s clear the party will continue to neglect under-18sWhat a time to announce it, just as evidence grows that children are under extreme stress as they return to school next week. Suffolk county council – with 50 out of 75 councillors Tory since time immemorial – is shutting most of its children’s centres. There are 38, built and paid for by the Labour government, but only 17 will stay open full time.There’s a fine photo of Ben Gummer, the Ipswich Tory candidate in 2010, with his supporters waving posters reading: “Sure Start SAFE with the Conservatives”. But as everywhere, children’s centres vanish under councils stripped of funds.Submitting evidence to the Commons women and equalities committee inquiry into body image, Girlguiding’s survey finds girls overwhelmed by impossible role models and YouTube “influencers”. Pandemic days when they have been left alone with little but social media will have made things worse. As for “levelling up”, this generation’s social and educational gap has widened, according to this week’s Educational Policy Institute report. Disadvantaged pupils are an average of 18.1 months behind their peers, with those on free school meals behind by 22.7 months at GCSE, with “persistent poverty as a contributory cause of the lack of progress”. And that’s before the effects of lockdown have been measured.A survey of 45,000 pupils, parents and teachers this week also shows the gap widening, and that everyone thinks children will need intensive extra help: yet there is no sign of the government providing anything like what’s needed. There’s no sign of any rethink of exams after this year’s calamity, and the disadvantage for next year’s GCSE and A-level entrants. Why not spend the astonishing £2bn schools spend on GCSE entrance fees on more teaching and less testing?It’s no surprise that birth rates are plunging. But the loss of children’s centres causes most despair: decades of research has shown that supporting every month of a young child’s development lasts through life, even improving earnings for disadvantaged children.Though “levelling up” should start at birth, no order nor money comes from Boris Johnson to tell Suffolk or any other councils to invest in their children’s centres. Labour did put children first, in education, Connexions, Sure Start and child tax credits. We are now in the year by which Tony Blair pledged to end child poverty altogether. Instead, watch how Johnson’s cynicism means he will “level up” only with physical, visible symbols in target seats: children and young people don’t vote. The question for Labour is how to turn its natural instinct for prioritising children into election-winning gold, when older voters seem to care too little."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7c9a5f0d6604a288003210dc18cfabc2bbbd5dc/195_325_3043_1825/master/3043.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f55afd612e8022c38a53d1a968d7a403","title":"local lockdowns england coronavirus watchlist","story":"The coronavirus watchlist system is a new version of an old rule: people given the least protection are the ones who need it the mostAs a general practitioner, Julian Tudor Hart lived and worked in south Wales. He pioneered much of what now constitutes modern routine preventive care, seeking out those most in need. His research from the 1960s onwards in Welsh mining communities showed that medical care was often not available to those with greatest need: the most deprived in society. Today we are seeing a corollary to this with the imposition of restrictive Covid-19 lockdown measures that target the most deprived – those who can least afford to endure them. The government has now announced trial payments for some people on low incomes who must self-isolate, but more is required.In the week ending 8 August, there were 110 positive cases of Sars-CoV-2 per 100,000 in the town of Oldham – breaking through the 50 cases threshold that puts it on the government’s “red alert” watchlist.Each week Public Health England (PHE) publishes a Covid-19 report that summarises information from the surveillance systems used to monitor the pandemic in England. Currently, 28 local authorities are on the at-risk watchlist following the weekly Local Action Committee meeting. In 18 of them, households are not allowed to mix. While weekly rates in Oldham have come down, they are still among the highest.PHE’s review in June promised to discover why the infection had such an unequal effect on people of different ethnicity. However, the report has been widely criticised for mentioning nothing about what could be done to improve the situation or suggesting plans for protecting at-risk groups.Are the restrictive measures, therefore, justified? The current watchlist level is based on an arbitrary figure that does not represent how we have assessed epidemic levels of community infection in the past.An epidemic is said to occur when weekly GP consultations for new episodes of flu-like illness exceed 400 per 100,000. This figure, therefore, refers to a person who has symptoms and is presenting to healthcare. On the contrary, current PCR testing is being used as a screening tool: in affected areas, testing is on the increase due to hypervigilance and active case-finding strategies that include knocking on doors. This strategy frequently picks up asymptomatic people.The watchlist figure of 50 per 100,000, therefore, does not consider the impact of the disease. Only nine people are currently in hospital with Covid-19 across the Pennine Trust hospitals that cover Oldham, Rochdale (also on the watchlist) and North Manchester. Increased testing leads to more detection of the virus, but it has not necessarily translated into infections that cause symptomatic disease. Many of those who have tested positive would be classed as weak positives – their risk of transmitting the disease further is low.Politicians’ urge to intervene is a sign that the test-and-trace programme has failed. But restrictive interventions are often too quickly deployed. Nevertheless, there is a radical need to improve living conditions improve access to health and social services address the urban environmental exposures that contribute to infectious outbreaks and rethink the social factors that cause high infection rates in deprived areas.Tudor Hart died in 2018. He is best known for his “inverse care law” that showed the availability of good medical care tends to correspond inversely with the need for it in the population served. The case for improving health outcomes in deprived populations is clear. But there is a pressing need for our politicians to think carefully before deciding what to do next and consider the wider needs of the people affected by such restrictive measures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd34b8612bddd07383ad418ee12d99bfb54e5049/0_287_4475_2684/master/4475.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73a83ab4c52b284ef5ced0f5018d3956","title":"nba strike jacob blake black lives matter","story":"They may have become millionaires in their 20s, but many of the NBA’s athletes still identify with those facing the brunt of violence and neglectThis week, it’s easy to see two possible futures for America. Our darker path is on display at a Republican national convention reaching new levels of xenophobia and paranoia. Every night, millions of viewers are hearing about enemies, “human sex drug traffickers”, even, being just barely held back by the steady leadership of Donald Trump.And then there’s basketball. Not just an incredible week of playoff comebacks and buzzer beaters, but real political action. Players from the National Basketball Association’s (NBA) Milwaukee Bucks and Orlando Magic went on a wildcat strike of sorts on Wednesday and decided not to play game five of their playoff series. They were protesting against the police shooting of Jacob Blake, the 29-year-old black man shot seven times by police in the back this Sunday in Kenosha, Wisconsin.Kenosha is less than 40 miles from Milwaukee and, according to ESPN’s Adrian Wojnarowski, Bucks players made the decision just before tip-off, deciding that they would not leave their locker room. Soon after, the two other NBA games were cancelled and Major League Baseball’s Milwaukee Brewers followed suit.Racial justice has been at the forefront of this NBA postseason. League owners had pushed to restart the season which had been put on hold since September due to the coronavirus pandemic. There were health concerns about plans to play games in a “bubble” in Orlando, Florida, but elements of the National Basketball Players Association also worried that the resumption of play could overshadow protests for racial justice.In the end, athletes took to the court, but with politicized slogans approved on their jerseys – pre-approved messages that ranged from laudable affirmations that “Black Lives Matter” and calls for equality and justice to ones that demanded neoliberal “education reform”.Among the four major sports, commissioner Adam Silver’s NBA has a reputation for being the most progressive. When confronted with potential unrest, it wisely chose to go with the flow and issue vague anti-racist statements, while carefully controlling and moderating statements coming from players.It was going swimmingly. But Wednesday’s strike was not according to the league’s careful plan.It is a statement that has more in common with the radical national liberation movements of the 20th century than a more recent crop of anti-racist literature like White Fragility and corporate musings about ersity – directed to a white audience to foster white guilt and introspection.For now, despite vague sloganeering turning into real disruptive action, the NBA has continued to swim with changing tides. Even the Orlando Magic, owned by the DeVos family and with deep ties to the Donald Trump administration, issued a statement saying that they stand united with the rest of the league “condemning bigotry, racial injustice and the unwarranted use of violence by police against people of color”.However, disruptive action costs the NBA advertisement dollars and potentially polarized fans. There will be every attempt to control the league’s ongoing rank-and-file rebellion and to neuter its development.A similar attempt, of course, was made to shape the wider Black Lives Matter movement. The 2015 protests in Ferguson emerged organically from a black working class not content to following the lead of Democratic party policymakers. But before long, the elite NGO world was able to elevate the movement’s most banal voices and shift a yet undetermined revolt from below into a “national conversation” about race hosted by the Ford Foundation.The direction that the unprecedented sports protests will take is, of course, up to the professional athletes and their willingness to continue even after public sentiment possibly turns against them. But it would be a mistake to dismiss this as just a rebellion of millionaires.NBA players might not be ordinary workers, but they have far more in common with the working-class communities that nurtured so many of them in childhood than with the billionaire owners they now work for. What’s more, to make change, just like all workers, they have to organize collectively. As journalist Branko Marcetic put it: “Millions of people are seeing workers they admire, even idolise, effectively striking in solidarity with a bigger cause.”If this becomes a running feature of sports celebrity culture in the United States, that will be cause for celebration – and emulation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9badd696cf7250b942409a58df622affc1797640/0_289_4335_2601/master/4335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=602a2b8c1e724b8e0c625a814c0ebe58","title":"teachers and parents across the uk share your thoughts on the reopening of schools","story":"We’d like to hear from people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland about returning to schools, and those in Scotland about how it has beenWith just weeks to go until children return to school in England and Wales, and less than a week until the first cohort of students in Northern Ireland return for the start of the new academic year, protective measures in schools remain fiercely contested.Many teachers have criticised the government’s ‘bubble’ group scheme and social distancing measures, while some unions have called for teachers to be able to choose to use face coverings, against government advice.We’d like to hear from teachers and parents about how they are preparing for the reopening of schools, and how they are feeling about it.If you are in Scotland, where schools are already open full-time, we’d also like to hear how it has been so far.We are particularly interested in hearing from parents about whether they will be sending their children back to school, and how they feel about possible fines for not doing so.You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish.

They want to know what will be done to eliminate future risks over the 25-year regeneration project.“There has been no proper investigation into how this contaminated site is affecting our health,” said Angela Fonso, of Cash, which wants the government to initiate a detailed study on the impact of the site in the context of the local population, one of the most deprived in London. “I don’t believe this environmental injustice would happen in a more affluent white area.”It is thought that living in areas with toxic air is one of the reasons people from ethnic minorities have suffered a disproportionate number of deaths from Covid-19.A Public Health England (PHE) spokesperson said: “The local authority is responsible for the health of its local population and any public health studies or analyses are for the local authority and its public health team to either carry out or commission.”The site of the former gasworks and chemicals factory has been dogged by controversy since Boris Johnson used mayoral powers in 2010 to overrule Ealing council’s decision against development. Since work began in 2016 to clean the 88-acre site of hydrocarbons including benzene, naphthalene and cyanide, dozens of residents in local streets have complained that a petrol-like smell from the site has been making them sick.Berkeley cleaned – or remediated – the soil on the site of contaminants in an open-air “soil hospital”. It was decided cleaning the soil was safer than transporting contaminated material along residential streets.In July 2018 the Environment Agency (EA) was called in and ordered the Berkeley Group to take steps to mitigate the odour, which the developer complied with.Campaigners claim the problems have persisted and last year crowdfunded for consultation to pursue legal action against the developer. The Berkeley Group has said “any legal action, if and when it materialises, will be vigorously opposed”.“No one wants to take responsibility for us and we’re paying the price with our lives. We’ve been knocking on the doors of the council, PHE, EA and politicians for years,” claimed Joginder Singh Bhangu, a campaigner. “Our community has fallen through the cracks.”Because of its scale, the gasworks redevelopment has multiple regulators: it is up to the EA to regulate the soil and advise Ealing on management of land affected by contamination Ealing has responsibility for investigating complaints of statutory nuisance and PHE are supposed to protect the health of the public. “Covid is showing that health is not just about numbers but about people,” said Araceli Camargo, co-founder of Centric Lab, whose report argues that the health risks of the site can’t be determined by the regulatory limits. The specific challenges to the health of people in Southall, such as overcrowding, stress and poverty, should have been evaluated before introducing a major new source of air pollution, she said.On Beaconsfield Road, a long artery from the junction near the station along the site boundary to a primary school, Bhangu regularly checks on the health of neighbours. Many gardens adjoin the site, where almost 4,000 homes will be built. “Of course we are more worried about coronavirus here, with all the chemicals,” he said. has interviewed dozens of residents of Beaconsfield Road and nearby streets to ask about their health since 2016. Of 48 who returned questionnaires to the , all said they had suffered breathing problems, and 42 said symptoms had led them to the GP. Other symptoms reported included eye problems, headaches, mental confusion and nausea. Arevik and Ashok Martirosyan invited the  to see an oxygen chamber they had rented for their seven-year-old daughter after she began having fainting fits. Around the same time both parents said they had experienced vomiting attacks, and suggested the symptoms were linked to “this very bad smell from the site”.That data – the only available – was provided by consultants for Berkeley, but residents believe Ealing should have conducted its own for comparison. The lack of any legal requirement for the council to do so, or for any of the regulators to act after PHE findings about chemical levels in March 2019, raises questions about the accountability to residents next to one of the UK’s biggest brownfield sites.Last March PHE found that levels of naphthalene, a possible carcinogen, needed to be “reduced urgently” to protect residents’ long-term health. PHE told the  to “get in touch with Ealing council to find out what actions have been taken as a result of the findings in the public health risk assessment”. Ealing council leader Julian Bell told residents in a virtual meeting on 16 July 2020 that chemical levels have been dropping since the soil hospital was dismantled last April.Dr Onkar Sahota, a London assembly member and GP, said that – as the planning authority with the duty of care to residents – Ealing must establish its own independent monitoring of the site for the next phase of development. “The cost of the independent monitoring consultants should be borne by the developer. Representatives of Cash should be on the appointment panel in equal number to those from Ealing council for appointing the new independent consultants to monitor for air quality, carcinogenic and noxious pollutants in the atmosphere,” said Sahota, who said work should stop while the health impact is investigated.Ealing council said it was “determining the criteria for establishing an independent air quality monitoring network around the development”.In any case, the data PHE looked at does not exclude risks to health. Air quality expert Prof Roy Harrison from the University of Birmingham told the : “The VOCs here are much higher than you would expect to see in normal streets,” adding that there would be little dilution of air pollution from the site at homes on the boundary and that naphthalene is “efficient” at getting indoors.Data he saw “well exceeded” PHE’s own guidelines for naphthalene, he said. “In one report, consultants had performed a calculation to estimate the likely annual average concentrations of pollutants, including naphthalene. This gave an annual mean in excess of the WHO recommendation of 10 micrograms per cubic metre. Notably, in a recent report, PHE recommended a lower guideline of 3 micrograms per cubic metre.”Prof Alan Boobis, a toxicologist from Imperial College, said many chemicals, including naphthalene, could explain residents’ symptoms, and stressed the mental toll of worrying about the air they breathe. “Once people are aware that chemical levels are excessive and associated with harm, they react badly to this toxicity and the behavioural response is real,” he suggested, likening this to post-traumatic stress disorder.Residents are now bracing for the next phase of the Southall Waterside development, when National Grid will remediate soil around the blue gas-holder that once signalled the way for planes arriving at Heathrow. It said it had taken “significant control measures” after seeing residents’ video testimonials about the impact of the site.Fonso said: “We want work to cease at Southall Waterside for mitigation measures to be improved during any remediation and for Berkeley to follow the lead of National Grid, which is erecting enclosures, air-filtering systems and removing contaminated soil from the site to protect residents from harmful odours, vapours and dust.”Berkeley did not comment on any plans for further remediation, saying: “This is a highly regulated activity and all work has been closely monitored and approved by the authorities, including the London Borough of Ealing and Environment Agency.”Residents worried about the planned Berkeley St William gasworks developments in East London, and in Brighton, have contacted the Southall campaign for advice.Bhangu, stopping to talk to an elderly neighbour on Beaconsfield Road, said: “What would I say to the other communities where there will be a gasworks redevelopment? Get ready for the nightmare.”Prof Kevin Fenton, London regional director for PHE, said: “The Southall Waterside air quality data provided to PHE has been compared to a variety of available health-based air quality guidelines … for the detected chemicals. The results from our assessments show that there is unlikely to be a risk to the long-term health of the nearby population from chemicals detected.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5b4ab6c1c0db5825a6889af96df7983f89c1ffe/0_193_3936_2362/master/3936.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e81631ea5e469ebfca94ec7ea75aadb","title":"all together now netflix review","story":"An adaptation of Silver Linings Playbook author Matthew Quick’s novel Sorta Like a Rockstar takes on homelessness with a heavy dose of sugarBrett Haley’s charming 2018 music drama Hearts Beat Loud should have been the toast of Sundance after its festival premiere. It was a sweet, progressive and warm-hearted crowd-pleaser, the kind that the festival has typically become known for launching, harking back to everything from Little Miss Sunshine to Juno. But polite acclaim didn’t lead to buzzy word of mouth which then failed to secure any box office that summer, a sign that for a certain type of feelgood indie, crossing over from Park City to the multiplex has became harder than it once was.An initially heartening result of its failure was that Haley headed straight to Netflix where a wider audience was waiting. And while he brought a more distinctive aesthetic to February’s YA adaptation All the Bright Places than most of the streamer’s teen flick directors tend to, his film was also a maudlin non-starter, unsuccessfully swirling together a drippy romance with an uneasily ticked off list of issues of the week. He’s back with alarming speed for another one, this time bringing Silver Linings Playbook author Matthew Quick’s novel Sorta Like a Rockstar to life, renamed as the forgettably bland All Together Now, an early warning sign of what’s to come.Like his last film, it’s a competently directed attempt to graft serious issues on to an otherwise rather anodyne teen drama and like his last film, it’s also an awkward misfire at best and an uneasy and irresponsible one at worst. The plot rests on the shoulders of Amber (Auliʻi Cravalho), a generous and bright-eyed teen who spends her days working hard and helping others but spends her nights sleeping on a school bus with her alcoholic mother (an on-form Justina Machado). She keeps her situation a secret from her school friends although as things worsen, the reality becomes harder to hide.There’s ample room for a sensitive and serious-minded drama about a homeless teen falling through the cracks of a society that allows so many to suffer without aid and the broad strokes of Amber’s predicament (tirelessly working at underpaid jobs, sleeping rough, hiding the resulting shame from those around her) are probably horribly recognisable to many. But Haley, scripting with Quick himself, is so eager to drown his film in sugar that the grimness quickly becomes soapy instead and any emotional response we might have fizzles with similar speed. Terrible things happen so quickly and innumerably to Amber that each new tragedy somehow matters less than the last and as we enter the final act with her dog also falling ill, it borders on parody.Amber is presented in such a flawless and heavenly way that I half-expected the twist to be that she’s in fact an angel sent to test those around her, a character whose optimism and inherent goodness is laid on so thick that she fails to resemble a real person. With Amber so charitable and so kind and so beautiful and so incredible at singing, there’s also an uncomfortable subtext that implies that only those on the bottom rungs with extraordinary assets deserve to be airlifted out of poverty by the rich people they interact with, as if she’s required to quite literally sing for her supper. Cravalho, best known for her voice work in Moana, struggles to turn such a cipher into a real person and sadly, she’s rather grating instead, acting as if she’s in a Disney Channel movie, a mode at odds with the supposed grit of the story surrounding her. There are also minor, thankless cameos from Carol Burnett and Fred Armisen which are barely substantial enough to distract from the grind of the plot.All Together Now is a rushed, barely plotted race toward a feelgood emotional climax that’s unearned and rooted in total fantasy and while again, it might look better than the majority of Netflix teen movies, it’s ultimately just as hackneyed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b98ac22ef25cfbc5efd56bef18c3921a96326340/60_287_2797_1679/master/2797.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44abc0aa7b519617b933859e09d817ce","title":"im thinking of ending things review charlie kaufman jessie buckley jesse plemons","story":"Jessie Buckley is a troubled young woman on the brink of breaking up with her boyfriend in this surreal, disquieting and sometimes extraordinary dramaWith his new film, Charlie Kaufman again proves that if you want something to make you feel trapped in a terrifying claustrophobic nightmare for ever and ever ... well, he’s your guy. His latest movie is about a student, played by Jessie Buckley, who for six weeks has been dating a dullish man called Jake (Jesse Plemons) for reasons that that she can’t put her finger on. She is now going to meet his parents, an important next step that she has sleepwalked into, like everything else in their relationship.It means a long, uncomfortable, cold drive out to these old folks’ creepy farm in the countryside – just at the moment when she realises that she maybe wants to end things with Jake, which gives her an anti-epiphany about her life and his. (“I’ve never mentioned Jake to my parents and I guess I never will,” she murmurs silently.)She has a clear, dispassionate glimpse of someone whose existence she really isn’t committed to and also of their supposed future lives together: a pointless, arbitrary entanglement, like all coupledom. A warning and despairing voice whispers in her head that all this is pointless but also breaking up could be pointless, too. Should she be ending things in a more radical way? Soon she is to be vouchsafed a haunting vision of the things that are important to poor, boring Jake – his mum and dad (wonderfully played by Toni Collette and David Thewlis), a local ice-cream store and his high school, whose sad old janitor (Guy Boyd) haunts this movie’s dreams.I’m Thinking of Ending Things is adapted by Kaufman from the novel by Canadian author Iain Reid and it’s really scary in a way that conventional scary movies really aren’t scary: insidiously disquieting and yet also somehow poignant and sad, a secondary mood that finally, inexplicably emerges from an unending rhapsody of directionless weirdness. Who is this woman? Who is Jake? Who is the janitor? It’s an arresting drama, although I was sorry that straight-up comedy (which Kaufman can really do) played little part.This film happens to be coming out right on top of Kaufman’s other new work – an epically bizarre autofictional novel called Antkind – and there are points in common, namely, Kaufman’s extraordinary, compulsive way of creating an alternative world of loneliness and sadness, accumulating tension and anxiety and suppressed panic minute by minute. You can spend up to an hour wondering uneasily when this film is going to start, while also realising that you have been on the edge of your seat.As ever, Kaufman shores up his world with pop-culture fragments. Real people get roped in. He has a digression-daydream featuring a made-up romcom directed by Robert Zemeckis. Are we supposed to look down on Zemeckis, therefore? Not necessarily. The couple’s road trip also features a long and rather bad-tempered discussion of the film A Woman Under the Influence by John Cassavetes, although the directors that have surely influenced I’m Thinking of Ending Things, such as Buñuel and Lynch, go unmentioned.The centre of the horror is that farm, stark and cold, where Colette and Thewlis’s strange pair host a decidedly unrelaxed supper party for the unhappy couple. As their appearance starts changing, with the furnishings and photos changing, too, Buckley starts politely asking Jake if they can go home now, and Kaufman demonstrates his unearthly skill in creating scenarios like lucid dreams. Molly Hughes’s production design and Łukasz Żal’s cinematography are also vital in fabricating this world.And what does it all mean? Kaufman is content to swirl away from actual revelations, but his evocation of high-school life occupies the position where in any other kind of fiction an explanation might go. It is a place where Jake seems to have picked up an uncool fondness for musicals and Broadway show tunes, and Kaufman imagines a kind of fantasy dance sequence for Jake and his new girlfriend in the corridors of the school. But perhaps it is more that for many (or maybe even everyone) high school felt shatteringly real in a way that nothing else would, and success there really does feel as good as winning the Nobel prize. Not that Jake has ever achieved anything of the sort, then or now.Plemons stolidly occupies the role of Jake – it is the kind of role that the late Philip Seymour Hoffman (star of Kaufman’s masterpiece, Synecdoche, New York) might also have played. And Buckley is impeccably cast as the young woman adrift in a bad dream someone else is having.• I’m Thinking of Ending Things is on Netflix from 4 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0c38b5987a18c483b52288c3f3ea3f2ff3b78fd/0_74_3003_1802/master/3003.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e2ac6c97877b7dce5b297e2695c0f834","title":"kim joys recipe for vegan chocolate cake and mousse terrarium","story":"Let your imagination run wild and dazzle your guests with this perfect party centrepieceThis dessert is perfect for a special meal – dazzle your diners with a large terrarium, or you can make mini inidual ones.

Leave to cool for 10 minutes.Sift together the flour, bicarbonate of soda and cocoa powder. Whisk to combine. Once cooled for 10 minutes, pour the liquid mixture over the dry, and then immediately whisk until smooth. Pour into the prepared cake tin, and bake for about 20 minutes. A skewer should come out clean when the cake is done. Leave to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, and then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.Then start making the plants using fondant. You can use plunger cutters to stamp out different sizes of the same-shaped flower, then stack them together and curve the edges upwards to make a succulent shape. You can also cut various shapes to create some taller plants. To make the strawberry mushroom, just cut off the stem top of a strawberry and then arrange it on top of a piece of fondant for the mushroom base. You can also use meringue instead of fondant if you have the time.When the cake is cool, use cutters to stamp out pieces of cake, and then use a knife to carve into the cake. Arrange larger cake pieces and crumbled cake on top of the chilled mousse to create a landscape.To create the green “moss” place some pale-coloured biscuits into a sandwich bag, seal and bash with a rolling pin until they’re crumbs. Then add a blob of green food dye, close the bag again and use your fingers on the outside of the bag to rub the dye evenly throughout.For the final decorating touches, sprinkle the green biscuit crumbs over the cake, then decorate with edible rocks, edible jelly rocks (optional), fondant plants, the strawberry mushroom, and dinosaur biscuits (optional).

Pep Guardiola has spoken to the Argentinian and City believe they have a chance, although they are aware it will not be an easy deal to pull off.The day after Barcelona’s sporting director, Ramon Planes, insisted the club “do not contemplate” Messi’s departure, it emerged that Bartomeu, as first reported by TV3, has told the player’s father, Jorge, he is prepared to step down in order to convince Messi to stay. The forward would have to publicly say the problem is Bartomeu, putting the onus on him to respond in a move seemingly designed to bring Messi into the open.Barcelona continue to insist that for him to apply the clause allowing him to walk away for free, Messi had to inform them by 10 June. Messi’s lawyers argue he could not inform them earlier than this week because the season was under way and therefore the date should be put back. It is not clear what the exact wording of the contract is.City are keen to see Messi exit on a free, while Barcelona continue to insist that anyone would have to pay his €700m buyout clause. There are mechanisms that can be applied, including City requesting an International Transfer Certificate from Fifa, but that is not without risks. A legal battle could ensue which is not really beneficial for either side, making a negotiated settlement more likely.Messi’s contract expires next summer and there is a belief in Manchester that he would contemplate going a year without playing if needs be. The City Group see him as not just a player but a global ambassador with a huge impact across all their clubs. With the market open for another five weeks, there is a long way to go.The chances of Messi making a U-turn in response to Bartomeu’s offer appear unlikely, not least because he has previously complained about accusations he is too powerful, effectively king-maker at the Camp Nou. If he were to do something that effectively removed the president, it would do little to alter those accusations. He distrusts Bartomeu and a resignation would do little to resolve his doubts about Barcelona’s ability to build a team capable of winning the Champions League.If Bartomeu were to go, it would also not yet mean a regime change. He would resign but not call elections, leaving the board in place until presidential elections scheduled for next March. Jordi Cardoner, the vice-president, would be the most likely candidate to take over as interim president.Victor Font, the leading opposition figure and favourite to win the election, has said that when he spoke to Messi’s camp he was told the decision was made. Although Font demanded Bartomeu resign immediately, he conceded the president’s departure would no longer serve to change Messi’s mind.So far there has been silence from Messi, who on Sunday is due at Barcelona’s training ground for tests before pre-season training on Monday.Meanwhile, Luis Suárez has hit out at comments made about his case that he considers to be untrue. The Uruguayan, who has been told by Ronald Koeman that he is not part of the club’s plans and whose lawyers are negotiating to rescind his contract, posted a message on social media.Alongside a hashtag that translates as #NotEverythingIsTrue, Suárez wrote: “There are people speaking in my name or saying things about me when it’s years since I had a relationship with them. I speak when I have to speak and I speak for myself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d9cd1afed4c2a2e76aab04c0e2e931216d169cc/0_135_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d8e199a0db3ebe7d039ebe6960a00187","title":"lionel messi to manchester city would be cash benefit to entire premier league","story":"Barcelona should accept the Argentinian’s wishes and let him leave with Pep Guardiola the manager best placed to sign himSuddenly and unexpectedly there is the very real prospect Lionel Messi, perhaps the greatest player in the world now or ever, will be playing in the Premier League. There are a lot of hurdles still to overcome if it is to happen, including a legal battle between two sides who believe he should be allowed to leave Barcelona either for nothing or for €700m but it seems clear he wants a move and that in Pep Guardiola Manchester City have the manager best placed to sign him.A week ago I wrote a column wondering what City could expect Guardiola to deliver for them, given his repeated failures in the Champions League. Messi would be the most emphatic answer to that question: a goal, assist and marketing machine who even at 33 could make a massive impact on the Premier League.Just as I’m sure that over the years Barcelona’s sponsors have paid more for the opportunity to associate themselves with Messi, the move would revolutionise City’s marketing operation. But beyond that, interest in an already massively popular league would rocket. Once fans are allowed back into stadiums, tickets for all 20 clubs would become harder to get hold of.Even if it wouldn’t exactly help their chances of winning trophies, every team could benefit commercially from the Messi transfer. When you consider not just the trophies he has helped Barcelona to win over the years but the number of replica kits he must shift and the number of tourists who are attracted to Camp Nou by the prospect of seeing him in action, you can understand Barcelona’s desperation to keep him. But I don’t think it is ever a good idea to force a player to stay when they are determined to go, even one of Messi’s stature.I remember going to see him play at Camp Nou in 2015 and it is only when you see him in action that you appreciate how little he sometimes moves. He comes alive in the key moments and in key areas but he is not a player who does a lot of running around.In the year I saw him Barcelona won the league and the Champions League, so I can’t imagine how he’d play if he’s actually not bothered and downs tools in protest against Barcelona forcing him to stay.Messi is human like everybody else and sometimes in their working lives people feel they need a change. It is not as if he just woke up one morning and decided to go.In my experience with contracts and in my current job as a sporting director, players and agents push for clauses that indicate their concerns. For example, international players do not always want to commit long term to a club that is not yet established, because they don’t know how competitive the team will be.Good contracts prepare for future eventualities, protecting the players’ careers and doing everything possible to guarantee their happiness. Messi is no different. He wants to enjoy playing and he wants to win major trophies and at Barcelona neither thing is happening.I can understand the appeal of a move to Manchester City. Of course he would be reunited with Guardiola and a handful of other staff members who worked with him at Barcelona. As a player I understand the drive to test yourself in another league and if he can come into a side who have had domestic success but struggled in Europe and guide them to victory in the Champions League, he would officially be the difference. It would add another layer to his legend, just like Cristiano Ronaldo has added to his at Juventus.If reports that Barcelona pay him £95m a year in salary and bonuses are true, clearly Messi has not stayed at the club for 20 years out of loyalty alone.But I hope Barcelona choose to respect his service, and negotiate a mutually acceptable deal to let him move on, rather than forcing him through a legal battle and removing his right to choose a new direction at this stage of his career.There is not a lot of room for sentiment in the law but the problem goes beyond money, it’s about respect for who he is and what he has given them.The fact he wants to go is an indictment of the way the club has been run in recent seasons – Messi, who in the three seasons since 2017 has scored 95 league goals and created another 47, really isn’t the person to blame for this situation.Barcelona’s fear will be that losing Messi will be a sporting and financial calamity but they could see this moment as an opportunity to refresh and renew a team who already needed major surgery. The £95m a year that would no longer be going to the Argentinian, as well as any transfer fee they end up getting for him, can help to fund that process.They already have some good young players and if it was me I would focus on the next generation and give the club’s fans something new to get excited about. Replacing Messi is an impossible job but you can build a team of talented young players who value every second of playing for Barcelona.They should be putting all their efforts into making that happen, instead of using the law to tie one of the club’s and the game’s all-time greats to a contract he has no desire to see out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17fe367544d9c3735bfe3189740fe18d0ec046a2/0_156_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=22f668799052368d02b5aaaa26b6bdfe","title":"share your experiences of returning to the office after lockdown coronavirus","story":"Whether you work in the UK or in Europe, we want to hear your views about going back to the workplace and commuting during the coronavirus pandemicWhile many people in countries like France, Germany, Italy and Spain have returned to the office, those in the UK have been slower to return to their desks.According to a survey by AlphaWise, only a third of British office workers have returned compared to almost three-quarters of staff in European countries.If you work in the UK or Europe, we would like to hear from workers about how they feel about going back to offices, and how your workplace has changed as a result of the pandemic.

This is a largely forgotten strain of British rap inspired by the sound of Public Enemy’s producers the Bomb Squad, with the tempo pushed up and one eye fixed firmly on the post-acid-house dancefloor.Pirate radio classics Spliffhead and Wipe the Needle are better known, but Mixed Truth is the Ragga Twins’ greatest moment, a particularly crazed example of the London duo Shut Up and Dance’s confrontational approach to production: potent, noisy electronics and immediately recognisable, obviously uncleared samples (in this case, from 808 State’s Pacific State).Hardcore’s goofy sense of humour attracted opprobrium, but no artist grasped that particular nettle like Altern-8. Detroit techno heads who became what Simon Reynolds called “the Slade of rave”, they dealt in pranks, blatant drug references and five-year-old MCs. It palled quickly, but E-Vapour-8’s Strings of Life sample and PP Arnold vocal overrides the jokey title.Another example of how Bomb Squad-inspired UK rap fed into rave, Total Confusion was the work of a trio including the late Casper Pound, who went on to found the celebrated techno label Rising High. On one level, it is very of its time on another, its sheer exuberance still cuts through.The work of trumpet-playing producer Gordon Matthewman, Compnded stole its riff from M1’s US house track Feel the Drums, pitching it up and placing it between bursts of fizzing electronics and tiny slivers of vocal. It’s a track that is constantly moving and shifting: the sound of 4am rave delirium.Dozens of hardcore producers fell foul of their cavalier attitude to sampling. Blame’s debut single is a case in point: you want the original version with the snatch of The Beginning by Seal – who apparently offered to re-sing it, before his label vetoed the idea – weaving through the dramatic synth stabs and warped vocal samples.In truth, any track from Foul Play’s first two EPs could have made this list – so could 1993’s more jungle-facing Finest Illusion – but personal preference, and an abiding love for the delirium-inducing moment at 2min 41sec where a sample from Xena’s electro classic On the Upside suddenly appears, means Ricochet clinches it.A pivotal track in the shift from techno to hardcore, Aftermath sounded noticeably different to the other big “Yorkshire bleep” singles released by Warp in the early 90s. The beat clattered away from a straightforward techno pulse, bass was even more overwhelming than that on LFO’s incredible LFO, the mood was weirder: simultaneously celebratory and unsettling.Lock Up ended up sampled on Dr Spin’s appalling 1992 novelty hit Tetris, a grim fate for such a great track. Only included on Zero B’s debut EP because he left the DAT of the intended track at home, it’s a perfect confection of funk guitar, Sheffield techno-inspired bleeps and exultant, hands-in-the-air breakdown.Charly inadvertently spawned a wave of rotten kiddie-rave novelty hits, but the original is fantastic: tense and atmospheric, its sample wasn’t a kids TV theme but a cartoon public information film warning about paedophiles. It’s closer in spirit to Bam Bam’s terrifying acid house classic Where’s Your Child? than the tracks it inspired.Shut Up and Dance were a law unto themselves: anti-drugs, even anti-rave – their biggest hit, the infamous Raving I’m Raving, was a sly dig at ecstasy users – their music never quite like anyone else’s. Named after a Hackney pub notorious for crack dealing, The Green Man was a gripping, disorienting swirl of orchestral samples.Goldie’s early releases exist in a liminal space where “dark” hardcore begins mutating into drum’n’bass. At the time, Terminator’s groundbreaking explosion of beats subjected to time-stretching – a key sound in the drum’n’bass arsenal – sounded utterly extraordinary, as if the world had suddenly spun off its axis.With the title of its mix referencing the Liverpool club Quadrant Park, Bizarre Inc’s Playing With Knives was a distinctly north-west twist on hardcore, brazenly stirring the area’s penchant for Italian house – replete with piano and screaming a vocals – into the mix. A perfect confection of commerciality and punch, it made the Top 5.Inescapable in 1991, Dominator offered the sound of the Mentasm “hoover” (see No 3) gone feral, relentlessly surging and ing behind a couple of snappy hip-hop samples. Joey Beltram’s breakbeat-laden remix is the killer all-out-assault, although the moment when the original version deploys an old-fashioned burglar alarm on top of everything else is pretty bracing.Rave producers often seemed to gleefully ransack the past, ripping out samples they then warped and twisted to their own chaotic ends. DJs Take Control is still exciting, but more reverential in its approach: its repurposing of the Nightwriters’ Chicago house anthem Let The Music Use You is a respectful tip of the hat to hardcore’s roots.A London collective beloved of the Prodigy’s Liam Howlett, blessed with some extraordinary pseudonyms – take a bow Fragile Scotty and James Da Shit – Genaside II’s masterpiece leavened its claustrophobic atmosphere and raw dancehall MCing with a sweet female street soul vocal. The awesome Narra Mine may be hardcore’s answer to Massive Attack’s Unfinished Sympathy.Ce Ce Roger’s early house anthem Someday spawned two rave anthems. Liquid’s Sweet Harmony warped the track’s piano riff and a snatch of vocal into a Top 20 hit Some Justice turned its intro into one of hardcore’s most glorious hands-in-the-air breakdowns, surrounded by explosive breakbeats and weirdly ominous synth stabs.Rightly credited with dragging rave into weirder, darker territory, 4 Hero’s hardcore tracks weren’t always straightforwardly nightmarish. The fantastic Burning flips between blissful female vocals and Loleatta Holloway samples and brain-scrambling chaos, capturing the moment when hedonism turns queasy and out-of-control.At the time, tracks like the Doc Scott-produced Here Come the Drumz seemed to ide the rave scene: some people embraced them, others didn’t want their high spoiled by something so intense and wilfully un-euphoric. Thirty years later, it just sounds awesome, a brutal wall of rhythm, car-alarm synths and Public Enemy samples.Outlander was Marcos Salon, who began his career as a producer on Belgium’s New Beat scene. His biggest track, Vamp, was both hugely influential and, with its roots in Detroit techno still audible, relatively restrained by Belgian hardcore standards. The exhilarating but off-kilter lurch of its main riff is a simulacrum of the ecstasy user’s unsteady ascent.This year, XL Recordings’ Richard Russell said he knew from the start that the Prodigy would be the rave scene’s biggest stars. Certainly, Your Love is a superb and remarkably assured debut single: a collage of uplifting house piano, soul samples and electronic noise, commercial without a hint of cheese.Financed by 80s soul star Phil Fearon and best known for Baby D’s No 1 Let Me Be Your Fantasy, the Production House label released a string of underground classics, but this mix of Euphoria – an overload of samples and blissful electronics over a rhythm on the cusp of hardcore’s transformation into jungle – is the best, a pure, shiver-inducing delight.Possibly the most influential dance track of its era, Mentasm stood out for its “hoover” noise. It was a product of the producer Joey Beltram’slove of heavy metal he tried to recreate its mood using a Juno synth. The sound – thrilling or terrifying, according to your mood – went on to consume hardcore itself: umpteen tracks used it in Mentasm’s wake.In snootier quarters, hardcore was viewed as house music’s gurning idiot younger brother: unsophisticated, predicated on novelty. Acen’s Trip to the Moon series gave the lie to that idea: his productions were complex, stitching samples from Rakim, John Barry, the Doors and forgotten UK soul band Tongue ’N’ Cheek into an utterly thrilling rush of sound.Three decades on, and with a clearer head, you can see why rave or hardcore was so reviled at the time by critics and house and techno connoisseurs. Populist rather than elitist, it was seldom subtle: the sped-up helium vocals, the blatant drug references, the jokes. Equally, who could dismiss a genre that birthed a track as flat-out great as Bombscare? It’s a masterpiece of minimalism – there’s nothing to it beyond a breakbeat, a nagging riff and sub-bass – but it works, effortlessly, perfectly. YouTube comments under hardcore tracks tend to defiant reminiscences of the “if you were there, you know” variety, which is true, but Bombscare doesn’t require a nostalgic glow to appreciate. And the flipside, Hold It Down, is amazing, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87e0514778945b1a9201e649f0c22e7fa30544c3/0_218_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55ae777e548d71130040f191c0a58cf5","title":"ed davey elected liberal democrat leader","story":"Former coalition minister says his party must start listening, after his win over Layla MoranEd Davey urged the Liberal Democrats to “wake up and smell the coffee” , as he was declared his party’s fourth leader in five years following a string of poor general election performances.Davey, who has been acting leader since last December, was a cabinet minister in the 2010-2015 coalition government. He beat his rival for the post, Layla Moran, by a wider-than-expected margin of 42,756 votes to 24,564.In a livestreamed acceptance speech on Thursday, Davey said: “My job, as from today, is to rebuild the Lib Dems to national relevance.”He said the Lib Dems were “powerful advocates locally”, but on the national stage “we have to face the facts of three disappointing general election results”.“Voters don’t believe the Lib Dems want to help ordinary people get on in life,” he told members who had tuned in to see his acceptance speech.“Voters don’t believe we share their values. And voters don’t believe we are on the side of people like them. Voters have been sending us a message, but we have not been listening. It is time for us to start listening,” he said. “I am listening now.”He promised to travel the UK in the coming weeks, adding: “I will face up to uncomfortable truths, and I will make your concerns my own.”But like the other party leaders, Davey will be denied the platform of a full annual conference to stamp his authority on the party in person. This year’s event, which was due to be held in Brighton, has been moved online.Davey stressed his ministerial experience and commitment to tackling climate change during a drawn-out contest.He told the  as he launched his campaign in June that he believed his experience as a young carer for his terminally ill mother had given him the compassion to help create a more caring society.“That would be a very big part of what I’d like to see the Liberal Democrats talking about: how we build a more caring society. And if we can make common cause with others for a caring agenda, I’d like to do that.”Davey described the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, as someone he could work with – in contrast to the Lib Dems’ frosty relationship with Jeremy Corbyn.Davey was energy and climate change secretary in the coalition government. He lost his Kingston and Surbiton seat at the 2015 general election when the Lib Dems, then led by Nick Clegg, were punished for forming a pact with the Conservatives.Davey won his seat back and returned to parliament in 2017. He went on to double his majority in 2019 when his Conservative rival was Aphra Brandreth, the daughter of the veteran broadcaster and former MP Gyles Brandreth.Clegg, who is now a senior executive at Facebook, made a rare intervention into UK politics by congratulating Davey, saying his “resilience, humanity and experience” would serve the party well.The leadership contest was initially shelved for a year as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, before being rescheduled for the summer.Davey’s predecessor, Jo Swinson, was leader for just five months after defeating Davey decisively in last year’s leadership contest.She expanded the parliamentary party with defections from Labour, and made stopping Brexit the Lib Dems’ overriding aim, echoing the tactics of Vince Cable who had raised eyebrows by posing with “bollocks to Brexit” leaflets before last May’s European elections.Swinson fought the 2019 general election claiming to be a potential prime minister, but ended up losing her own seat to the SNP.All of the former Labour MPs who joined the Lib Dems after forming the breakaway group Change UK, including Chuka Umunna and Luciana Berger, lost their seats.Davey was Swinson’s deputy during that general election campaign, which a damning internal report described as a “high-speed car crash”.Moran, 37, was a teacher before entering parliament in 2016. She is currently the Lib Dems’ education spokesperson, and had been expected to shift the party to the left if she won.In a video message to her supporters, Moran congratulated Davey on his victory and said she was ready to work with him to “change our party so that we can change the country,” adding, “I’m so excited now to just get cracking.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af2c412d235bdbfcf660a893f67b005882930586/0_134_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f9f191438eab597963363a0b14c7aa5","title":"ed davey entirely inconsequential victory speech quintessential lib dem event","story":"New Lib Dem leader offers no great vision, no plans for alliances ... nothing much at allMaybe a cardiograph could have picked up a hint of a heartbeat, but to the untrained eye the Lib Dem leadership contest appeared to have been flatlining almost from the start. It’s not as if the Lib Dems don’t try to provide excitement – this was the fourth leadership election in five years. And some of the party’s core membership might have picked up on fractious areas of dissent between Ed Davey and Layla Moran – at least 87 people tuned into one YouTube hustings – but the rest of us were either totally unaware the contest was taking place or just didn’t care one way or the other.But all good things – and, indeed, all relatively indifferent things – must come to an end and in an online announcement shortly after 11.30 by the Lib Dem president, Mark Pack, it was revealed that Ed Davey was the winner. The same Ed Davey who had come a distant second to Jo Swinson last time round. The same Jo Swinson who had gone on both to lose her seat and all but obliterate the party in the polls in December’s election after insisting she was a genuine contender to become prime minister. Voters may be a bit dim at times, but not that dim.Prior to the declaration, the Lib Dems had tried to inject a little excitement into proceedings by insisting that the vote had been incredibly tight, but Davey romped home by 45,756 to 24,564. Moran hadn’t even bothered to turn up to the result with a victory speech prepared just in case. Their only exchange appeared to be one rather awkward, and not entirely socially distanced, handshake at the very end. Though by then someone had switched the lights off and it wasn’t easy to see who was doing what to whom. Still, you had to admire the commitment to the environment.Davey strode to the podium wearing a black face mask, which he removed before speaking. He began by thanking Moran for the way she had fought the campaign, for inspiring the youth vote – though, luckily for him, in insufficient numbers – and reassuring her that she had an important role to play in the future. Which, given that there are just 11 Lib Dem MPs, including Davey and Moran, felt like the least he could do. When it comes to a Lib Dem shadow cabinet, everyone is included.This was the highlight of his last 30 years – it takes all sorts – and he was proud to say he loved the party. “I believe in it,” he said. “But it is time to wake up and smell the coffee.” One could argue that moment had come five years ago when it was hammered by voters for its role in the coalition government, but no one wanted to spoil the moment. Davey also referred to the last three elections in which its results had been “disappointing”. Disappointing as in completely catastrophic.“It’s time to listen,” he continued. “And I am listening now. Whether you are from the north or the south of somewhere in between. Whether you are a brexiteer or remainer, I will travel up and down the country to meet you.” The thought did occur that it might have been better if he had decided to do a bit of listening a while ago. After all, he was the cabinet member in the coalition government who had voted both for austerity measures and tuition fees. A bit of listening to potential Lib Dem voters back then could have made all the difference. Indeed, it was hard to wonder if Davey wasn’t still part of the problem, rather than the solution. Though more that 42,000 party members had thought otherwise.And that was about it. There was no great vision for the future of the Lib Dems. No hint as to whether Davey would be working with Labour and the SNP to fight the increasingly illiberal policies of the Boris Johnson government. No hint of how he would stop those unhappy few who had voted Lib Dem last time because they couldn’t stomach Jeremy Corbyn from drifting back to Labour now Keir Starmer was in charge. No hint of anything very much.All of which made it more or less the quintessential Lib Dem event. Thoroughly niche and almost entirely inconsequential.

Grand conspiracy theories offer nothing for a party that has been out of office for a decade so far.”He said Corbyn staff had demanded the party defund the campaigns of some prominent critics of the leadership and give extra resources to some key supporters who had bigger majorities.Heneghan said some staff, many of whom were named in a leaked internal report describing a “hyper-factional” environment among party workers hostile to Corbyn, had set up a defensive campaign to save Labour seats rather than to deliberately defy the leadership.The anonymously leaked report, which reignited painful isions in the party, included hundreds of private WhatsApp messages from named staff, many of whom expressed hostility towards Corbyn or his close allies and bemoaned Labour’s better-than-expected performance at the 2017 general election.Some workers are alleged to have used racist and sexist language to denigrate senior allies of Corbyn, including Diane Abbott.Heneghan said: “Recent weeks have seen the growth in conspiracy theories suggesting there was some grand plan to ‘throw’ or ‘sabotage’ the 2017 election. This is not the reality but simply a deflection tactic to absolve the architects of the 2019 campaign of their culpability for a disastrous result.”He said party staff had expanded the target list to include 93 offensive seats at Corbyn’s team’s request, giving them extra digital advertising and key seat visits. But Heneghan said he refused to comply with a request in mid-May that some held seats should be defunded, some of which he considered “very marginal”.“The seats to defund were largely MPs considered by Corbyn’s team to be political opponents (many of them would fall to the Tories in 2019),” he said. “I was also given a list of seats that needed extra funding. Most of these had majorities of over 10,000 but were strong allies of the leadership.”Heneghan said he would provide evidence of his claim to the independent inquiry into the leaked report and Labour’s culture under Corbyn, chaired by Martin Forde QC.In their submission to the party inquiry, Corbyn and his leadership team have accused hostile officials of setting up a “shadow operation” in a Westminster office as part of efforts to plot their own election course and defend anti-Corbyn MPs.Heneghan defended that action, saying 2017 polling had consistently showed that Corbyn was unpopular in “red wall” seats, many of which fell to the Tories in 2019.“Corbyn’s team were simply not prepared to take polling information seriously,” he said. “But we knew we couldn’t acquiesce in allowing these seats to fall.” He said campaigners at the party’s headquarters then changed tactic to focus on local issues in those seats rather than the leadership.Heneghan said the loss of seats such as Mansfield, North East Derbyshire and Stoke South was proof the strategy was correct, adding that the campaign retained seats such as Dudley North, which was held by the Corbyn critic Ian Austin but fell to the Conservatives in 2019.“I have heard it said that Labour could have been in power for just over 2,000 more votes in the right seats. It’s also true that the Tories could have won a majority by moving a lot fewer votes the other way,” he said.“To suggest these questions of judgment are akin to sabotage is laughable. Yes, there were differences of opinion on how to get the best result possible. In the end I think the balance between offensive, and defensive was probably just about right given the facts and data we had. It’s hard to claim the balance was right in the 2019 Labour campaign.”He said WhatsApp messages in the leaked report, which appeared to show Labour officials sounding horrified at the party’s advance, “omits our WhatsApp messages such as ‘amazing, amazing, amazing’… or the excitement when its confirmed it’s a hung parliament”.Officials named in the report plan to take legal action against the party over data protection issues and libel as well invasion of privacy and, for some staff, breach of contract and employment.In the formal submission to the inquiry by the officials accused of sabotage, which was leaked to the  this month, the officials allege their WhatsApp messages were used to falsely make them seem racist and sexist."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce88fa59252d3813211fe8f51d71790aa547616d/0_0_2265_1359/master/2265.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f94ed1c5e533154a3f9eb40a790b2f14","title":"taught me value slowing down solace of allotments","story":"UK allotment holders took comfort from their plots in the worst days of the pandemic.

Users who have downloaded an app made by a public health authority can opt in to a decentralised tracking system. Their phones record details of other devices they have been near, and if one of those users later marks themselves as infectious, exposed iniduals receive a notification.Until now, Apple and Google have required users to download an app made by a recognised public health authority to enable the exposure notification system. That has prevented UK residents from using the service, unless they installed a contact tracing-app from another country, such as Ireland or Germany whose apps were available in UK app stores. Even then, they could only use the app passively, since both foreign apps require a diagnosis from their respective health services to mark oneself as infectious.When new versions of iOS and Android are made available, which is expected in the next two weeks, users will be able to join an exposure notification system without needing to download any app at all. They will, however, still need a recognised app to mark themselves as infectious, putting extra pressure on the UK government to move its own app out of beta testing and make it available for general release.But the pressure has diminished in recent months owing to the poor performance of contact-tracing systems in other nations. In June the French government revealed that its contact-tracing app had sent just 14 notifications in its first three weeks of operation, with only 68 people entering a positive test result, despite 2 million downloads.The country was hampered by comparatively low uptake, which the new Apple and Google system is intended to overcome. But in Germany, which uses that system, more than 16 million people have installed the app and only 500 have marked themselves as positive. Worse, the extra privacy built in to Apple and Google’s system means the German institute of public health has no further information on efficacy, because it is unable to collect data about how many users were warned.Following the release of iOS 13.7, the iPhone operating system with the new contact-tracing system, Apple is expected to launch iOS 14 in early October alongside new iPhones. That version of the operating system contains a number of major changes to how iPhones work, including a new privacy-preserving system that allows users to prevent tracking from advertisers.“Our ability to deliver targeted ads on iOS 14 will be limited,” Facebook said. “As a result, some iOS 14 users may not see any ads from Audience Network, while others may still see ads from us, but they’ll be less relevant.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8533035e5b354f7a6b213b482c3d602943d1b639/0_227_3405_2043/master/3405.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cb969a631039f356ab87ccb3b8239dc","title":"walmart joins microsoft bid for tiktok takeover in us","story":"Retailer hopes deal could help target younger consumers and boost its nascent ad businessWalmart has partnered with Microsoft to bid for the US operations of hugely popular video-sharing app TikTok, as the world’s largest retailer looks to become a force in the fast-growing digital media sector.Walmart, which is looking beyond bricks and mortar to rival to Amazon in online retail, said that it is confident the joint bid will pass muster with the Donald Trump administration.Trump’s trade war with China has forced ByteDance, the Beijing-based parent of TikTok, to seek a sale of its North American business to a US company within 90 days or face being shut down. Trump has accused the video app of threatening national security.Walmart has said that a deal will allow it to better target a younger demographic, as most of TikTok’s hundreds of millions of users are in the 12 to 24 age bracket. A deal would also boost its nascent advertising business. Amazon has rapidly grown its online ad business to almost $15bn (£11bn) annually.“We are confident that a Walmart and Microsoft partnership would meet both the expectations of US TikTok users while satisfying the concerns of US government regulators,” Walmart said in a statement.However, Walmart’s previous forays into digital media have not always been a great success. Earlier this year it sold its Netflix-style streaming service Vudu, which it launched a decade ago, to movie ticketing company Fandango for an undisclosed sum.Microsoft has been in talks for weeks to buy TikTok’s business in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand and has been considered the frontrunner. Rival bidders for the business include Larry Ellison’s Oracle, which has partnered with a group of US investors including General Atlantic and Sequoia Capital.The political situation that TikTok has found itself in has claimed its chief executive, the former Disney executive Kevin Mayer, who resigned  just months after joining.The hiring of Mayer, who oversaw the successful launch of Disney’s global streaming service Disney+ but was overlooked to replace chief executive Bob Iger, was meant to address the issue that TikTok needed to become a more US-centric business."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf81b0b8fc9f9108a644887a0aa7f7f3d21c1395/0_244_4288_2572/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72ed71aead0c4f87c4e092388c903ca5","title":"10 great coastal beach clifftop walks the uk","story":"From Sheppey to Shetland, our readers share their favourite walks along beaches, estuaries and clifftops Pack your swimmers, a small towel, a bottle of water and take the coastal walk from Fowey Harbour to Polkerris Bay. It is a moderate to strenuous walk of almost five miles (longer if you choose the circular walk back to Fowey), but you will be rewarded with the discovery of secret beaches en route, where you can stop for a swim and take in the beautiful views. Another highlight is the shipwreck that inspired Daphne Du Maurier’s Rebecca at Polridmouth cove. End the walk with a seafood lunch at Sam’s on Polkerris beach (booking recommended) or a drink at the Rashleigh Inn next door, and watch the sunset on the beach. Natasha CouttsMy favourite clifftop walk is in Lerwick, Shetland. If you start along the Knab towards Sound, it is the most relaxing way to start or end the day. There are sheep who bleat like an old man, seals who are curious and playful and even an egg honesty box at a B\u0026ampB along the way. The colour of both the sea and the sky is grey-blue – sometimes it is hard to tell where the sky ends and the sea begins. If feeling brave, the pebbled beach offers an opportunity for a refreshing swim with the seals.Marie BourneMy tip isn’t so much a walk as a climb: the Elie chain walk. You edge your way along ledges and up and down steps in the cliffs, clinging on to chains anchored in the rock for the more precipitous sections – and there are lots of them. Consider it a via ferrata for beginners. I managed it with five- and eight-year-olds although, in truth, it’s probably unsuitable for most youngsters. But, then again, it’s so refreshing to come across this sort of exploration that hasn’t (yet) been stymied by the health and safety police. You will never forget the experience. Oh, and watch out for the tide times!Paul KirkwoodStart your walk in Bridlington – parking is free on the south side. The walk begins along Belvedere Parade and continues south along a path, past the hamlet of Wilsthorpe, then opening out on to a cliff edge path (which is sometimes awash with butterflies), eventually coming to an excellent coffee shop, the Cow Shed at Fraisthorpe beach. It’s about three miles to there. After coffee and cake with a superb view of the bay, return on the wide-open beach, easy underfoot and with sightings of seabirds and waders, as well as second world war sea defences. Six miles, great coffee, wide open views, an extensive beach, nature and history – all the ingredients of an excellent walk.Sarah VernauWhen adventuring with my family, access is our first consideration, as our little girl has a disability. My partner and I have always adored coastal walks, so we were blown away by the breathtaking circular walk called Baggy Point, just east of Croyde beach in north Devon. It is largely accessible (with the rare rocky patch) and has no shortage of jaw-dropping scenery. • nationaltrust.org.ukStephanieExpect to see wildlife along the picturesque Royal Military canal before crossing to Hythe seafront and enjoying the boardwalk and dramatic sea towards Sandgate. Check out the village’s short stretch of quirky shops, then cut back to the beach to spot some residual artwork from the Folkestone Triennial. Have a lolly at the beachside Mermaids Cafe when you reach Folkestone, then let the kids go wild in the amazing, free adventure park at the Lower Leas Coastal Park. Don’t miss the fabulous coastal planting, then zigzag your way back up the path for afternoon tea at the Grand. Promenade harbour-wards and take in the Channel views, pass the water lift and memorial arch, then finish at one of the vibrant new pop-up bars on the Harbour Arm.KateThere is an easy five-mile stroll on the Isle of Sheppey, beginning in bustling Leysdown-on-Sea. Heading eastwards, the rows of caravans drop away and the vast expanse of muddy sand is bequeathed to flocks of gulls and oystercatchers. The neat breakwaters of Leysdown give way to lines of jagged wooden posts, sticking up like shipwrecks out of the sand. Take a break at Shellness beach, made up entirely of tiny pastel-coloured shells. Then head through the bleakly beautiful Swale nature reserve, keeping the sparkling Swale estuary in view – a great place to spot seals basking on the sandbanks. After an afternoon of soul-cleansing isolation, finish at the Ferry House Inn for outstanding local fare.Alexandra McLanaghanI usually catch the train from Porthmadog to Criccieth, it’s only a few pounds. From Criccieth station head to the nearby castle (currently closed) before dropping down on to the beach path and past the glass-fronted, art deco Dylan’s restaurant, which is always worth a visit. The pebbly beach gives way to easier walking underfoot as you circumnavigate the headland, with fantastic views over Blackrock Sands and an easy walk along the beach, picking up the Welsh Coastal Path to the beautiful beaches before Borth-y-Gest (where the Sea View Cafe does great ice-cream) before finishing your walk into Porthmadog. It’s about five miles, three hours maximum, great at any time of year.Ian OwenThe Norfolk Coastal Path is best known for vast sandy beaches, tidal marshland and pine woods. But one outstanding section climbs from the pretty fishing village of Weybourne and stretches along clifftops overlooking the always dramatic North Sea. This walk defies the reputation of “flat Norfolk” with spectacular views across rolling fields, gorse, heather and woodland. Catch glimpses of steam trains puffing along the Poppy Line to Holt. Follow the path up to the lifeguard lookout point before dropping down into Sheringham. Ride the cute little Coasthopper bus back to Weybourne for lunch at the Ship Inn.NikkiSilecroft, on the Cumbrian coast, has a great beach, and this is a quiet and easy walk – close to the southern fringes of the Lakes, but well away from the tourist crowds. Famous for the opening credits of BBC’s Countryfile, with the horses running through the waves. At high tide there are pebbles but at low tide there’s a flat expanse of sand, as far as the eye can see to the north and south. If you’re lucky, you’ll see no one else. If unlucky you might have to share it with maybe 20 others. Head south for an easy walk on the sand for about four miles, enjoying the views across the sea to the Isle of Man, or inland to the local fells, until you get to the quiet, peaceful village of Haverigg.

He wasn’t feeling well, either, so she made him chicken noodle soup with Texas toast, the way he liked it.“He was so weak and scared here by himself,” Garcia said. “That’s why I came.”Even though she wore a mask and gloves, she wound up sick four days later. Her father had given her Covid-19, but she didn’t regret taking care of him. Because had she not, she wept, “I would have never seen him again.”“I think that poverty, proximity to the river, the large amounts of population growth that are undocumented, kind of forces families to bunch up together, which is exactly what you don’t want,” Melendez said.Tight-knit families are a cornerstone of Latino culture. Those bonds, which are usually advantageous, have also been weaponized by the pandemic. Entrenched in Latino ideals is the principle of familism, or prioritizing family above inidual needs. And, unlike in much of mainstream America, Latino family structures often include a larger swath of extended family members, explained Bernadette Sánchez, a professor of educational psychology at the University of Illinois at Chicago.Amid life’s most troubling moments or difficult change, families offer comfort for Latino communities. But the rituals in place – quinceañeras, weddings – require assembly, Melendez said.Likewise, there are “expectations and obligations about the family supporting one another”, said Sánchez, an ethos that can turn tragic when an essential worker gets exposed to the virus.“You could be taking all the measures yourself to be cautious, but it’s not necessarily culturally acceptable to not be there for your family,” Sánchez said.Garcia called the safety restrictions required by the pandemic a double-edged sword: “you can’t get close, yet you can’t – don’t – wanna stay away”. She had stopped visiting her parents to avoid infecting them, but they both contracted Covid-19 anyway, as did her aunt, uncle and cousin.Once Covid-19 enters a Latino home, it’s found an especially hospitable environment. “It is more typical to see a multigenerational household,” where grandparents reside with their children and grandchildren, and “maybe an uncle or aunt lives there, too”, Sánchez said.In Hidalgo county, four or five members of a single family often get sick with the virus, Melendez said. There are government resources to help family members who need to isolate, but to access those, the community has to know they exist.“That’s not possible,” said Rogelio Sáenz, a professor of demography at the University of Texas at San Antonio, which then makes the situation “even more dangerous”.In Hidalgo county, Priscilla Garcia’s father was intubated first. Her mother suffered a heart attack. The couple was always together they graduated, got married and worked out of the same house. But as they fought for their lives, they were relegated to separate hospitals.“I had to be making their decisions for them while I was sick,” Garcia said. “It was really hard.”Both parents died, just days apart. Then, after more than a month-long fight, Garcia’s aunt also succumbed to the virus. “It’s just so much going on that honestly you can’t even think right,” she said.She’s at least found a sliver of peace in a picture that she found of her parents, from when they were young. Her father is holding her mother’s face, she thinks after he returned home from the army.“It kinda gave me a little validation,” she said, “that they were together.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfd1b2ae39d8bba5e8a4ce016872ffa518b17fe1/0_133_2000_1201/master/2000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=01ccb31714fa81d3ba8002bfe5554d4f","title":"how do you feel about the uk government self isolation payment scheme","story":"We’d like to hear from people impacted by the new scheme which enables people on low incomes to claim payments of up to £182People on low incomes in areas with high coronavirus infection rates will be eligible for a payment of up to £182 if they are forced to self-isolate, the government has announced.The scheme, which will be trialled from Tuesday in Blackburn with Darwen, Oldham and Pendle, follows weeks of campaigning by regional mayors, councils and trade unions who warned that millions of people could not afford to isolate without pay for 14 days.We’d like to hear from people on low incomes on their thoughts on the new scheme.

On Tuesday Briatore was confirmed to have tested positive for Covid-19 after being admitted to hospital in Milan, according to a statement from his staff.Officials are now facing the challenge of contacting everyone who has been at the club in recent weeks. Italian media reports, suggest Billionaire welcomed between 8,000 and 11,000 guests in the first weeks of August, and authorities fear many registered with false names or phone numbers.New cases of Covid-19 have increased rapidly in Italy in recent days. The country reported 1,367 new cases on Wednesday, its highest daily tally since May when the country was still under lockdown. Half of the new cases in the Lazio region have been traced to holidaymakers returning from Sardinia, some of whom frequented Billionaire.Briatore harshly criticised the Italian government in mid-August when it ordered the closure of all nightclubs. “This new decree was written by a madman,” he said at the time.The businessman has said he was taken to hospital because of an inflammation of the prostate and was given a coronavirus test while there.He has also been forced to close his Cipriani restaurant in Montecarlo after two members of staff tested positive for Covid-19.The Bologna coach, Siniša Mihajlović, who socialised with Briatore in Sardinia, has also tested positive for coronavirus.Briatore also met the former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi at his compound on Sardinia’s Emerald Coast in August. “I came to visit my friend, the president: I love him so much and find him in good shape. Bravo Silvio,” Briatore said in a short video posted on Instagram.Berlusconi said this week he had taken a test and did not have Covid-19.Sardinia was one of the Italian regions least affected by the epidemic.

He and the passenger he was travelling with were then taken off the plane before it was due to fly to Pisa in Italy.The pair were moved to the airport’s isolation area, where they were met by health authorities. Their seats and the overhead cabin bins were then disinfected, with the plane finally leaving over an hour behind schedule.Ryanair said in a statement: “The passenger and his travel companion were immediately offloaded and taken to a Stansted airport isolation area where they were assisted by local public health authorities.“Since this passenger and his companion had complied fully with Ryanair health regulations, they were both wearing masks at all times at Stansted Airport and for the very short period (less than 10 minutes) they were seated on the aircraft prior to departure.“There was little if any risk of Covid-19 transmission to other passengers or crew members as all of whom were also wearing face masks at all times.“The aircraft departed for Pisa following a delay of one hour and 20 mins to allow for the empty seats and overhead cabin bins to be disinfected to comply with all UK health authority guidance.

Instructions on the Department of Health website read: “If you are getting a coronavirus test because you have symptoms, you and anyone you live with must self-isolate until you get your result.“This also applies to anyone in your support bubble (where someone who lives alone – or just with their children – can meet people from one other household).”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc22657ec9f1d47c382e45add2ab6f7a65d35314/53_0_2894_1738/master/2894.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=233275329e0b0025af31a00ef37624e5","title":"uk sees highest number of new covid 19 cases since mid june","story":"Daily case numbers and seven-day rolling average now higher than on 23 March when national lockdowns announced.The UK has recorded the highest number of new coronavirus cases since 12 June, with government figures reporting 1,522 positive cases.The number of new cases, which cover the 24 hours to 9am on 27 August, were up 474 on the previous day.The average number of cases confirmed in the past seven days stood at 1,155, the highest rolling average recorded since 22 June.Both the daily case number and the seven-day rolling average are both higher than on 23 March , the day national lockdowns were announced (967 daily cases and 730 cases on a seven-dayrolling average).To date, there have been 57,200 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, according to figures from the UK’s three statistical bodies the Office for National Statistics, National Records of Scotland and Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency.On Tuesday the government reported 1,184 lab confirmed cases, which was up from Monday’s total of 853. The new figures mark the sixth day in a row that the seven-day average has increased.However, hospitalisations as a result of the virus remain low: just 767 people were in hospital due to Covid on 25 August, the lowest number of coronavirus patients since 27 March, the first day for which the government’s dashboard has data.Clusters of new cases have been reported in Plymouth in recent days.Health officials have said that as many as 30 teenagers who took a holiday to the Greek island of Zante may have contracted coronavirus.At least 11 of a group of 18 and 19-year-olds in Plymouth have tested positive for Covid-19 and some had been for a night out in the Devon city since their return from their holiday.The council’s public health director, Ruth Harrell, said her team was working alongside the national systems to contact and trace the young people thought to have been affected.Many of the teenagers who tested positive showed no symptoms or very minor symptoms such as a sore throat after returning from the Greek island, which is not currently subject to UK quarantine rules.Plymouth city council said a further separate outbreak in a factory had been confirmed earlier this week.Harrell added: “We are in contact with all the pubs and bars across the city to remind them of their frontline role in stopping the spread of this virus. They need to help us to protect the city. But it also needs everyone to help too.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9335a08d0acaef8f016a4bf44663dbc0c090c2db/0_199_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73adb14257516f010c2ef492e7a674d7","title":"uk coronavirus live people on low pay to get covid isolation payment","story":"UK’s daily cases tally up from 1,048 on Wednesday transport secretary confirms three countries added to quarantine list government falls short of contact-tracing target for ninth week in row.

There have now been 41,477 deaths.• Jamaica, Switzerland and the Czech Republic were removed from the travel corridor list by the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, while Cuba was added. The new rules mean people arriving into the UK from the first three countries after 4am Saturday will have to quarantine for two weeks, while those arriving from Cuba after that time will not.• An outbreak at a poultry plant in Norfolk has led to its partial closure. At least 350 staff and their households will have to self-isolate as a result.• Pret a Manger announced it had cut 2,800 jobs, significantly more than the 1,000 figure on redundancies that it warned of in July. The Royal Shakespeare Company also said it will begin redundancy consultations.• Ed Davey became the leader of the Liberal Democrats, comfortably defeating his rival Layla Moran and immediately signalling that he would try to move beyond the party’s narrow appeal to remain-voting supporters at the last election.• Health secretary Matt Hancock faced uncomfortable questions over the £13 a day on offer to those asked to self-isolate. LBC’s Nick Ferrari asked: ‘Is £13 a day enough to persuade someone not to leave the house? I’m not going to stay indoors for £13. Are you, secretary of state?”We’re closing the UK blog shortly, but you can continue to follow our world coronavirus coverage by clicking below.Even as the government seeks to take a hard line on refugees crossing the Channel and the Home Office tweets that “activist lawyers” are disrupting the removal of migrants with no right to be in the UK (before later agreeing not to use the phrase), new figures reveal that the number of asylum applications has almost halved as a result of coronavirus. A total of 8,455 claims to be granted asylum in the UK were submitted in the first three months of the year, compared with 4,850 from April to June, figures from the Home Office showed.Meanwhile, a resettlement programme had to be suspended because of coronavirus, prompting campaigners to call for it to be reinstated.The Vulnerable Person Resettlement Scheme (VPRS) accounted for more than three-quarters (2,956) of those resettled in the UK in the year to June.Since the project launched almost six years ago, 19,768 refugees, mainly Syrian nationals, have been resettled in the UK as part of a 20,000 target by the end of 2020.Stephen Hale, the chief executive of Refugee Action, said the scheme had been frozen since 12 March and there had been no arrivals through the scheme since.“Whilst pausing the programme earlier this year was understandable due to the pandemic, there is no earthly reason why it can’t be restarted now.”A senior official at the Czech Republic’s tourism board said they “deeply regret” the UK’s decision to remove the country from its quarantine exemption list.Katarina Hobbs, director of CzechTourism UK and Ireland, said: “The Czech Republic remains a safe country to travel to. It will continue to monitor and manage the current situation whilst welcoming visitors to the country.“This is a British government decision that we deeply regret and hope that the UK government will reconsider their decision very soon.”She added: “We continue to provide important information to tourists who are visiting – which includes avoiding crowded areas and following the strict rules that have been implemented by the Czech Republic government.“The Czech Republic can assure all visitors that strict rules and measures are in place for travellers and citizens – wherever the location.”In Wales, the health minister, Vaughan Gething, confirmed travellers from the Czech Republic, Jamaica and Switzerland would have to quarantine. But he said Cuba and Singapore would be added to the list of exempt countries.As in England, the new regulations will come into force at 4am Saturday.As the prospect of sudden quarantines for people arriving in the UK becoms more familiar, it’s worth noting that insurers will have little sympathy. Patrick Ikhena, of comparethemarket, said a decision to cancel a trip to avoid the mandatory quarantine rules would be considered a “disinclination to travel” and many policies would be unlikely to pay out.He also said that most travel insurance policies would no longer cover trips to the three countries included in Grant Shapps’ announcement, and advised holidaymakers that they may be able to get compensation or alternative dates and destinations if they contacted their airline or hotel.Further to Shapps’ announcement, the DfT issued a statement:Infections from Covid-19 are on the rise across Europe.“The government has made consistently clear it will take decisive action if necessary to contain the virus, which includes removing countries from the travel corridors list rapidly, if the public health risk of people returning from a particular country without self-isolating becomes too high.“This means holidaymakers may find they need to self-isolate on return to the UK and are advised to consider the implications of self-isolation on them and their families before making travel plans.Shapps, who released the news via Twitter, also said that Cuba had been removed from the quarantine list.The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has confirmed that travellers from the Czech Republic, Jamaica and Switzerland will have to quarantine for 14 days if they arrive in England after 4am on Saturday. Officials had been waiting for the most up-to-date infection figures to be released in Prague before making a final call.The Department for Transport said equivalent measures were being put in place in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Scotland took Switzerland off its list last week.Pret a Manger has said it has completed a restructuring of its UK business and axed 2,800 roles from its shops, significantly more than it warned of earlier in the summer.Before the redundancies the company employed 13,000 shop staff globally, including 8,000 in the UK.The daily figure of 1,522 new lab-confirmed cases is up from 1,048 yesterday. And it is the highest single day figure since June 12.You can explore the figures on the government’s coronavirus data page.The government said that as of 9am on Thursday, there had been a further 1,522 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus. Overall, 330,368 cases have been confirmed. Figures published by the UK’s statistics agencies show there have now been 57,200 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate.Separate figures say that 41,477 people had died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Thursday, an increase of 12 on the day before.New research has found that coronavirus-related delays to IVF treatment will have a significant impact on successful births.In the US this is the equivalent of 734 fewer live births a year, according to researchers from the University of the West of England and the University of Glasgow.Andrew Smith, a senior lecturer in statistics at UWE Bristol, said: “As IVF success is very sensitive to age, older women are less likely to have a successful outcome and live birth rates will be lower as a result.At least 350 households will have to self-isolate after a coronavirus outbreak at a poultry plant in Norfolk, Kevin Rawlinson reports:The Banham Poultry site, about 15 miles south-west of Norwich, had been partially closed and all staff who worked on its cutting floor had been sent home, local health officials said.Norfolk officials declared the Banham outbreak on Tuesday, saying at that point that seven positive tests had been returned. That was increased to 46 the next day and 75 on Thursday as more test results were returned.Sad news from the Royal Shakespeare Company, which has said that it will begin redundancy consultations with some employees, and that it does not expect its theatres to fully reopen until next year.Artistic director Gregory Doran and executive director Catherine Mallyon issued a statement saying: “It is now clear that the ongoing pandemic and the continued need for social distancing mean that we will not be able to stage full RSC productions in our theatres before 2021.”They added: “It is with great sadness that we have now reached the stage where a formal consultation process with employees must take place to safeguard the long-term future of the company.“We had hoped that things would have become more positive by now, but this has not been the case.”One of the country’s most senior police officers has said he is “disgusted” at a rise in recorded assaults of emergency services workers in England and Wales.Martin Hewitt, the chairman of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, said constabularies would “use the full force of the law” to prosecute those accused of striking police officers, ambulance workers and fire crews.His comments came after the latest figures showed the number of incidents in a four-week period rose by almost one-third compared with the same period last year.Josh Halliday reports on issues with England’s test-and-trace system, with one in seven home tests failing to produce a result:Public Health Wales said another person has died having tested positive for coronavirus, bringing its total number of deaths since the beginning of the pandemic to 1,595.The number of cases of Covid-19 in Wales increased by 35, bringing the revised confirmed total to 17,843."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95b487f6298ae93d44202b825f8a670866569fed/0_126_1242_745/master/1242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f518095e322503bde96d36abf69c4f3b","title":"four young artists reveal how they express their unique voice in pictures","story":"As part of  Labs’ collaboration with Levi’s and young people with something to say, Gen Z illustrators and photographers discuss what informs their work‘We need a more erse understanding of the world’“I use my art to celebrate the lips, noses, hair and skin colour of women from black and mixed-race communities who have become stigmatised and criticised by society,” says illustrator Vicki Jones. “I believe everyone is beautiful and worthy of greater acceptance. I want other black and mixed-race people to see someone who looks like them, and for our white allies to see people who aren’t like them. It gives us all a more erse understanding of how the world is.”‘We have to question body image issues’“I had a problematic relationship with food and body image, and so did most of my friends,” says photographer Fanny Beckman. “Did you know that more lives are lost to eating disorders than any other mental health condition? Women of My Generation is a multimedia project which combines photography and a podcast to question beauty standards, and dismantle our body image issues. I want to prove that it is, beyond doubt, possible to feel confident regardless of body size, sexuality, ethnicity or socioeconomic background.”‘Look closer, and a new level opens up’“My illustration style is lowbrow, cartoony, so it might not strike you that there’s meaning beyond the skateboarding-style graphics,” says illustrator Chris Martin. “But I’m hoping to communicate bigger issues in my drawing. As with the Cambridge Analytica scandal, there are unseen forces at work. Forces we don’t see straight away, but which create a deeper tension. There’s always another level to what we first think we see.”This is what confidence looks like“I use my voice to empower women and celebrate the ersity I see in my home city, London,” says photographer Milli Ahern. “I use bright saturated colours to project strength and confidence – a confidence that I didn’t feel myself, growing up. I was bullied about my appearance as a teenager. But that experience actually gave me strength as it led to me learning about photography, which allowed me to find my voice and highlight the beauty in ersity. Everyone needs to be seen and heard.”At the heart of the Your Voice. Your Way campaign is a zine, paid for by Levi’s, celebrating voices outside the mainstream. Created jointly by the four incredible artists showcased here and four talented writers, it proves the power of expressing yourself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13d96520ce96b542084eb940ffc7aef88405e9ee/716_1017_4167_2500/master/4167.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=965dc8ed0fd980af935b0bfd767c08d5","title":"good jeans the man who gave levis a social conscience","story":"Whether it’s climate change, homophobia or hidden talent, one of the best known brands in the world is stepping up to give people a voiceSome brands are so big, so ubiquitous, that it’s hard to imagine that they were once small businesses, or that the name on their instantly recognisable logo belonged to a real person. Levi Strauss was one of those real people. Born in Bavaria, Germany, he moved to the US in 1846. After seven years in New York, he headed to the west coast to join the gold rush, not as a prospector, but to set up a wholesale business, dealing in, among other goods, clothing.In San Francisco he quickly became a respected businessman and, in 1873, struck gold himself when he spotted the potential of the hard-wearing riveted trousers being made for labourers by tailor Jacob Davis. The two men went into business together, as Levi Strauss \u0026amp Co, and before long were manufacturing thousands of pairs of blue jeans, the US workwear that went on to become a worldwide wardrobe staple.Beyond his thriving business interests, Strauss was committed to sharing his prosperity with the community around him, becoming one of the biggest philanthropists in 19th-century San Francisco. He made donations to an orphanage, a school for the deaf and supported several charities. He also set up 28 scholarships at the University of California, Berkeley, part of his enduring legacy.Today, Levi’s operates in 110 countries, and in March 2019 debuted on the New York Stock exchange, valued at $6.6bn. But it is Levi’s values, rather than its value, that the brand wants to talk about today. So what are those values? “Empathy, integrity, originality and courage,” says Jason Kyriacou, the UK marketing and experience director. “These four pillars shape how we work and the decisions we make. It’s what we want to stay true to.”Levi’s is a true San Francisco native, and not just in terms of embracing today’s tech takeover. The brand’s hometown is the gay capital of the US, and Levi’s has a long history of working with LGBTQ+ groups. In the 1980s, it was one of the first corporations to advise staff about HIV and Aids, reaching out when both the disease and the groups initially likely to be affected by it were heavily stigmatised.The company went on to advocate for gay marriage.In the UK today, Levi’s takes the spirit and ideals of its San Francisco creator and embodies them in a uniquely British way, not least in its ongoing partnership with Queer Britain. “It’s a young organisation with bold ambitions,” says Kyriacou. Queer Britain curates and archives examples of gay culture in the UK and hopes one day to establish a permanent museum. The three-year partnership kicked off last year with a photography exhibition that coincided with London Pride 2019. The show, on the theme of Chosen Family, celebrated the ersity and uniqueness of the LGBTQ+ experience through the work of four artists, Alia Romagnoli, Bex Day, Kuba Ryniewicz and Robert Taylor.Another strand of the company’s work, the Levi’s Music Project, has given young people from London to Barcelona access to recording studios, workshops and classes, and offered them the chance to be mentored by trailblazing musicians. This is all part of a global drive by Levi’s to ensure emerging talent has the opportunity to find its voice, and a platform where it can be heard. Among the artists inspiring the next generation are Mist, Vince Staples and Rosalía.Last year, a short film for Levi’s Your Voice. Your Way campaign featured five young people from the Levi’s Music Project. The artists came from across Europe, including Londoner Hak Baker and Liverpool’s Michael Aldag. They had received mentoring in their respective projects from rapper and producer Skepta and Brit-hop musician Loyle Carner.“It’s been about enabling people to learn and to express what they want to say,” says Kyriacou. “These are all people who haven’t gone through conventional channels and might not have been heard.”For the latest manifestation of Your Voice. Your Way, Levi’s is partnering with  Labs to publish a counterculture zine put together by eight young creatives. The writers, photographers and illustrators recruited for the project by  Labs are all aged between 18 and 25, and have little – if any – media experience. What unites them is that they all have a powerful story to tell, in the zine that will be published on Saturday, 27 June.“Again, it’s about giving creative voices a chance to say their piece in a place they wouldn’t usually have access to,” says Kyriacou. The team have free rein to work on their zine, with advice from  Labs staff and no limitations from Levi’s.“Projects like these aren’t about telling people what they can and can’t do,” says Kyriacou. “We’re here to support and do the best we can. We try to be facilitators more than anything. I don’t think we can dictate to any community around what they need to do to benefit themselves. That’s not for us to do.”Use Your Voice ...The Your Voice. Your Way campaign is a reflection of Levi’s values and its commitment to giving a voice to people who are often marginalised and overlooked.In this spirit, a zine, sponsored by Levi’s, is being produced by eight talented young creatives.

The 22-year-old from Milnthorpe in Cumbria is passionate about illustration, but also wants to stay true to his ideals about the type of work he aims to produce, rooted in skate culture. “The prospect of having my work published nationally felt so distant,” he says. But Chris’s work, along with that of seven other young creatives, will appear next Saturday, 27 June, in a supplement published with .Your Voice. Your Way is being created by young people aged between 18 and 25 from across Britain who feel strongly that they and their contemporaries need to be heard when it comes to shaping the future. “I am driven to uncover how our world is steered,” says Chris. “And how, not just as creatives, but as people, we can change it.” Commissioned by Levi’s and  Labs team, the magazine aims to give a platform to the unheard, and amplify their voices.“Their generation has what I’d call a positive stubbornness,” says Jason Kyriacou, the UK marketing and experience director for Levi’s. “An uncompromising attitude to what they believe in and the courage to act on it.”Now, that attitude is needed more than ever. When  Labs and Levi’s started recruiting for the project, in the first months of 2020, issues surrounding climate change, shifting identities and inclusiveness came up in nearly every application. What gave the project even more urgency was the outbreak of Covid-19.Suddenly the future was ever more uncertain, and the assembled contributors – all with little or no media experience – had to adjust to working on the project remotely and contacting their mentors from  Labs using video meetings.Writer Kiera Moran, 24, has had the unusual experience of self-isolating before, and writes about the experience of seeing her five-year-old son through cancer. She started writing up late at night, caring for her child. “Sleep deprived at 5am, I have spilled my heart out,” says Kiera, from Merthyr Tydfil. “My voice is honest and unassuming. Coming from a working class background, I feel I am familiar and welcoming, with a story hidden behind nightmares. I was excited to have such an amazing opportunity. I hope to develop my writing and use what I’ve learned in future work.”Another writer, Anna Marshall, 21, from Durham, drew on her experience in climate activism for the project. “I want to contribute to a fresher and more daring version of professional journalism,” she says. “I was buzzed to see what we could make together,” she says. “And I was excited to work with talented people who are dedicated to what they do.”For the other two writers, Ayat Mohamed, 18, from London, and Sam Carrick, also 18 and from Gosport, the project was a chance to think about their place in the world and how they and others are viewed. “I hope someone reads it and feels understood,” says Ayat.Illustrator Vicki Jones, 21, from Birmingham, was keen for her work to be seen by the people she depicts, often women of colour. “The message I’d like people to take from my work is to be proud of who you are regardless of skin colour, facial features or hair type,” she says. “To just love the way you look. I am passionate about this message and I want others to feel that they can be heard too.”For the two photographers, Milli Ahern, 23, from London, and Fanny Beckman, 25, lockdown meant the biggest adjustment, forcing them to think creatively about what they could shoot in and around their homes, and they responded with positivity. “I was beyond excited when I found out I was chosen to work on this zine,” says Fanny, who is from Malmö, Sweden, but lives in London. “To get advice from people in the industry I have always dreamed of being part of means a lot to me.”“We received hundreds and hundreds of applications,” says the project’s casting editor Anna Fielding. “Every single person who applied had something important to say. The eight collaborators have exceptional clarity of expression and a real drive to see a new world. They’ve been inspirational to work with.”Although it has never been easier to self-publish work, or create a social media presence or a podcast, it’s difficult to be heard among so many others doing the same.The reach of an established newspaper still matters, as does being heard by an audience beyond your peer group.  Labs and Levi’s were happy to turn over creative control and act as supporters and signal-boosters. The hope is that the conviction and passion displayed by these eight will inspire others to find their voices. The collaborators were paid for their time and work, and will be mentored for six months by  Labs staff.Beyond encouraging young people to speak out and push for positive change, the aim is to let the world see the power of their potential. “We want to create a platform that this team perhaps otherwise wouldn’t have had. And then to put it in front of people who might not otherwise read it, because it would have been in places they wouldn’t normally look,” says Jason.The team may be only eight strong, but they represent their generation and they represent Britain. Do look at what they have to say: it contains the seeds of our future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e66095eef528002831fac4e99023fe4cd7c16d3d/0_0_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cb5a9af8f4ac55c3e0eaa2de5753670","title":"gen z on challenging stereotypes i only saw muslim women on arabic channels","story":"Writer Ayat Mohamed is 18 and, like all of us, she’s an inidual with many aspects. So why is it so hard for her to find people to identify with in the media?I’m a Gen Z Muslim woman with immigrant parents and I don’t fit many stereotypes. Other stereotypes fit me alarmingly well: I think rice is one of God’s greatest creations, I talk too much, I care about my hair too much – which is even worse as nobody outside my household sees it.I also care about climate change, animal exploitation, mental health, respect, feminism and more. I’m multidimensional, and I don’t see myself represented enough.Representation has the power to implant views and stereotypes into mainstream consciousness, for better or for worse. We all need role models and there are lots of us who are being let down.It’s up to all of us to fix that. Starting now. Here, five people reveal how they’re breaking boundaries in race, mental health, body image, religion and age representation ...Malin Andersson“Mental health representation will make us all stronger,” says Malin Andersson, a mental health advocate and TV personality.I talk about grief, depression, body positivity, and domestic violence on my Instagram to open up those conversations. I get about a thousand messages a day from people saying I’ve helped them, so I know I’m raising awareness.Speaking up, especially when you show your vulnerability, can make people feel less alone and encourage them to share their experiences too. The more we talk about mental health issues, the more we take away their shame and stigma. We create space to be ourselves without being scared of what others will think. I hope this will lead to better representation of mental health issues.Dr Fatumina Said Abukar“I experienced racism because of a lack of representation,” says Dr Fatumina Said Abukar, an award-winning UCL scientist, model and Stem ersity advocate.I grew up in a small village where my family were the only people of colour, and I experienced a lot of racism.People threw eggs at me and beat me up, and I faced racial slurs. I’m frustrated when I walk into ersity shoots and I’m the only person of colour. When you only have one token figure it’s impossible for them to represent their whole community. This can lead to them being attacked by their own community if they do or say something wrong. I want to see different types of beauty in the media.Stephanie Yeboah“If I’d seen someone who looked like me, I would’ve had less self-hate issues,” says body positivity blogger Stephanie Yeboah.“I grew up feeling uncomfortable in my own skin. I’ve always been into fashion, but I felt like I had to hide that because there were few plus-size-friendly shops. I hated myself and dieted constantly. After university, I went to New York and met a group of women who were all bigger than me – yet confident and effervescent. Inspired, I posted a full-length picture of myself on social media.I was shocked at how positive people were. This generation is so lucky to have role models like Lizzo – I would’ve had less self-hate issues if I’d seen her when I was growing up. The body positive movement was created to celebrate women whose bodies aren’t seen by society as beautiful, so I’d like to see more variety of body shapes in the media.Zaynab Shaikh“Muslim women need better representation in fashion,” says hijabi model Zaynab Shaikh.Muslim women aren’t represented enough. Take fashion: few fashion brands care about Muslim women who want to dress modestly. Shopping is difficult because everything is too tight, sheer or has cut-outs. Just: no.Now, young people ask me how they can start modelling, which is so nice because when I grew up I only saw Muslim women on Arabic channels.Zahra Mohamed“Young people deserve people who look like them,” says Zahra Mohamed, Ayat’s 15-year-old sister.Representation affects young people and the adults we become. I have an issue with adult actors playing teens on screen as they create unrealistic expectations of how we should look, which has led to a rise in eating disorders, depression and anxiety.I like TikTok because it’s full of normal people. Instagram is full of heavily filtered influencers who I can’t relate to. It’s not fair that teens have to obsess over their appearance.

Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins DublinA further 93 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in the State on Thursday as public health officials ruled out a reopening of additional pubs next week.The National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) considered the reopening of pubs that do not serve food at a meeting on Thursday. Previously, the earliest pubs would be permitted to reopen was Monday, August 31st.Following the meeting, acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said “we didn’t feel that we could recommend today that it would be appropriate for pubs to reopen next week.”The matter would be considered again in two weeks time, along with other recent restrictions on indoor gatherings to six people, and 15 outdoors.Dr Glynn said NPHET also considered the continuing effective lockdown of Kildare, and said while the rate of increase in cases in the county had stabilised in recent days, he could not recommend lifting the lockdown early at the meeting on Thursday.No further deaths from Covid-19 were reported by NPHET, leaving the death toll at 1,777. The total number of cases in the country now stands at 28,453.Dublin has the highest number of new cases at 34 while there are seven in Kildare, six each in Donegal and Laois, five each in Limerick and Waterford with the remaining 30 cases spread over Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Cork, Louth, Meath, Monaghan, Offaly, Tipperary, Westmeath and Wicklow.The majority of the cases, 73, are associated with outbreaks or close contacts of a confirmed case while 12 were identified as community transmission.Men account for 52 of the new cases and women account for 41 while 70 per cent of the total number of new cases are under the age of 45.Professor Philip Nolan, chair of the NPHET Irish Epidemiological Modelling Advisory Group, said: “The R-number is now between 1 and 1.2. While this is an improvement on what we have seen recently, it is still not where we want to be. We are still seeing growing transmission of the disease and we need to bring the R-number back below 1 if we are to effectively slow the spread of Covid-19 and suppress its transmission.”The briefing heard 392 outbreaks of the virus were currently being investigated by public health teams. Of those 252 are related to social gatherings in private houses. There were also outbreaks in workplaces, in other social settings and retail outlets.One outbreak in a pubrestaurant involved 26 cases and that subsequently led to 10 additional cases in another workplace.Another restaurant had 19 cases and it involved staff, customers and was associated with a family outbreak separately.Another involved six cases in a sports club and there was then transmission at an associated social gathering resulting in 19 further cases.There was an outbreak too in a retail outlet that involved seven cases in staff some of whom worked while symptomatic.In Northern Ireland, one more person with coronavirus has died, bringing the total number of fatalities recorded by the North’s department of health to 560.A total of 69 new cases of Covid-19 have been identified in the North in the last 24 hours, bringing the number of confirmed cases in Northern Ireland since the pandemic began to 6,964.Lockdown riskEarlier on Thursday, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the Government is determined to take measures to avoid a fresh lockdown over Covid-19 but “the danger and challenge is always there”.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly told an Oireachtas committee on Wednesday the State was at a “tipping point”, and that the coronavirus pandemic is “close to having us lock down the country again”.Asked about Mr Donnelly’s comments, the Taoiseach said: “The big story this week is the reopening of our schools - a million people between students and teachers coming back into our schools.“We have been visiting schools to see the extraordinary work of teachers, SNAs, and school managements, really good to see the contribution they have made to enabling children return to school.“Our strategy is to live with Covid-19, to protect jobs, particularly manufacturing facilities like the one we visited this morning - to get our schools open again and to resume our health services. And, by taking the measures we have taken, we want to try and avoid the lockdown, but the danger and challenge is always there.”Mr Martin was speaking in Limerick at the announcement of 400 jobs at US pharmaceutical firm Regeneron.Targeted measuresSpeaking at the Oireachtas committee on Covid-19, Mr Donnelly said that if public health advice is followed, schools and businesses can remain open and the virus can be suppressed.However, he said: “the reality is we are dealing with a virus that is close to having us lock down the country again. The public health advice is that we are at a tipping point and we are doing everything we can to suppress this virus to stop a second lockdown”.He said that if a second lockdown were to happen, healthcare services will be “severely curtailed”. Currently, the strategy is to use “targeted measures to suppress the virus while keeping as much of our society and our economy open as possible”. He argued that the experiences of Kildare, Laois, and Offaly showed that suppressing the virus through this strategy was possible.He warned, however: “If there is a second wave the Government will have to consider the blunt instrument which we know works, that is, a lockdown. We are doing everything we can to avoid that.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoStronger legislation\u0026rsquo planned after footage surfaces of guests dancing at weddingMove brings staff salaries into line with those who work at the AssemblyParents issue plenary summonses against Hyde And Seek Childcare Ltd, Hyde and Seek Glasnevin LtdOne-fifth of parents unlikely to avail of Covid-19 vaccine, CSO survey findsSearches took place in four counties in the Republic on Wednesday, Garda sources sayTopics included \u0026lsquoFalse allegations of child abuse against the Catholic Church, including homicide\u0026rsquoKildare lockdown to remain in place but rate of infection in county stabilising, officials sayClosures may follow \u0026lsquoevidence or concern that spread within the school is primary driver of cases\u0026rsquoCarlow Kilkenny TD is not expected to attend the D\u0026aacuteil when it resumes early next weekRandom cruelty underlines stigma associated with obesity, says Prof Donal O\u0026rsquoSheaHealth officials rule out routine classroom closures if single Covid-19 cases are foundFuture of cafe will depend on Dubliners seeing it \u0026lsquoas relevant\u0026rsquo, operators sayRelatives of Bernard McGovern had reportedly staged protests outside QIHUrsula von der Leyen asks the Government to suggest a man and a woman as candidatesStamps, souvenir envelope mark quarter century of well-known TV sitcomCountry is ranked third highest for greenhouse gases per capita in the EUStudy indicates obesity increases risk of dying from Covid-19 by almost 50 per centHong Kong Free Press claims Aaron McNicholas is latest victim of Beijing\u0026rsquos attack on press freedomDanny Kinahan, an ex-British army officer, \u0026lsquohonoured and proud\u0026rsquo to take up the roleOffshore search resumes after man falls into water at Kerry HeadStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4340330.1598539482!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"an ecumenical matter stamps commemorate 25 years of father ted","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tActor Pauline McLynn, who played Mrs Doyle in the show, at the launch of An Post stamps celebrating 25 years of Father Ted, at the GPO in Dublin. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe New stamps to commemorate the 25-year anniversary of the TV sitcom Father Ted have been unveiled in Dublin on Thursday.The four stamps feature one-liners linked to the main characters of the programme Fr Ted, Fr Dougal, Fr Jack and Mrs Doyle.They include: That’s mad, Ted (Fr Dougal), That would be an ecumenical matter (Fr Jack), Will you have a cup of tea Father? (Mrs Doyle) and That money was just resting in my account (Fr Ted).The stamps, which were unveiled at the GPO and designed by Dublin’s Detail Studio, also include retro wallpaper in the background to match the different rooms in the Craggy Island parochial house.Actor Pauline McGlynn, who played Mrs Doyle, said the sitcom remains synonymous with Irish culture 25 years on from the airing of its first episode in 1995.“I can’t believe it’s been 25 years, it’s wild. I just can’t think of a greater thing to happen. As milestones go it’s not on anyone’s list, as you never think you will be on a stamp.

Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Bewley’s cafe on Grafton Street in Dublin has reopened after announcing it was to permanently close earlier this year.The cafe was opened to customers again on Thursday morning and is initially offering table service and a limited menu.Paddy Campbell, artist and owner of Bewley’s cafe, said “we’re really happy to be back open again” despite operating at less than a fifth of its capacity.“We have to be conscious of Covid so we can only let in so many people at a time, we have the capacity for 400 people in this building,” he said.“At the moment we can only let in 50 so we have one-fifth of our capacity. That’s not an easy burden to carry but we believe that the values are very important, that Bewley’s is a legacy, Bewley’s is something that we have a commitment to keep going and we hope that the public will support us.“We can’t take in enough people to pay the rent obviously but as the business builds we hope the public will support us and support their own cafe because this cafe belongs to Dublin, not to me, not to anybody else, to Dublin and therefore it’s very important that we all participate in not just opening it today but keeping it open.”The cafe had been closed since March 16th, when the Government introduced lockdown restrictions and the decision to close the cafe permanently was announced in May.The cafe’s 110 staff had been informed on July 1st that they were being made redundant, with the closure blamed on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy, and the €1.5 million annual rental cost on the protected structure.The cafe has been loss making for several years with the rent accounting for 30 per cent of its annual sales.It emerged at the end of last month that Bewley’s had agreed to pay more than €749,000 in rent arrears and interest costs to Ronan Group Real Estate (RGRE), the landlord of the cafe. RGRE is controlled by property developer Johnny Ronan.Cól Campbell, son of Paddy and managing director of Bewley’s, said the future of the cafe largely depends on Dubliners and that “they see it as relevant”.“It will require a deep commitment but we’re up for the challenge,” he said. “In May things looked really bleak, that was the pit. What changed was the journey that we went on... the changing health outlook, perhaps a less bleak economic outlook and a great belief in the resilience that Bewley’s has shown almost over two centuries of life.”Bewley’s Oriental Cafes Ltd first opened on Grafton Street in 1927.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4339638.1598472921!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pandemic is close to having us lock down the country again donnelly","story":"Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly has warned that Ireland is at a tipping point with regard to Covid-19 and that the country may be locked down again.

As of midnight on Tuesday, there have been a total of 28,363 diagnoses, and 1,777 deaths in the Republic.Mr Donnelly said that the winter plan for the health services is being produced several months early, and will be the “most comprehensive winter plan that has ever been launched”, but he warned that “because of the costings involved . . . it will not be cheap”.At an earlier Committee session, Health Service Executive head Paul Reid said that the plan was “not just about a winter plan”, and that the HSE board is finalising plans “for a set of funding that will see us through the winter and through 2021”.This will involve a range of significant, different approaches aiming to keep people out of hospitals,” he said.Mr Donnelly also said that “we may well end up at a public inquiry” into deaths in nursing homes in the State and that he is “open to the idea”. However, referencing the Scally report into Cervical Check, he said the right approach may not be a public inquiry, and that the best approach for the families of those who had died should be adopted.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4340360.1598541763!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar intends to stay as fg leader as search for hogan successor intensifies","story":"European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has called on the Irish government to propose a man and a woman for the role of Irish commissioner in the wake of Phil Hogan\u0027s resignation. Video: European Commission\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer taoiseach Leo Varadkar with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at Government Buildings in Dublin last January.  Photograph: Fran VealeThe Tánaiste Leo Varadkar has said his “intention” is to continue leading the Fine Gael party but has left the door open as to whether he would be one of the Government’s nominees to replace Phil Hogan as EU Trade Commissioner.When asked by reporters if he would like the senior role in Brussels, Mr Varadkar replied: “My intention is to continue to lead my party, to work hard in my job as Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment, and to become Taoiseach again in 2022.”However, when pressed further, and specifically asked “are you ruling yourself in or out”, all he would say is, “that’s my answer”.European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen has asked the Government to suggest a man and a woman as candidates to replace Mr Hogan.On a visit to Limerick, Mr Varadkar was asked if he had regrets over the circumstances that led to Mr Hogan’s resignation.“Of course I do, Phil’s a good colleague, a very good friend and somebody who I reappointed as Commissioner, because he did such a good job in his previous role,” Mr Varadkar replied.“The situation developed as it did, he was given an opportunity to explain his whereabouts and his movements within Ireland and to confirm that he had been following the public health guidelines, and unfortunately over a period of days it transported that he had not.“But, ultimately, this was a decision that was made by President von der Leyen, not by the Irish Government, but i think it was the right decision in the end. Of course, lots of regrets.”Mr Varadkar did not call for others who attended the Oireachtas Golf Society dinner to resign, adding: “I think there’s a distinction between private citizens and public representatives but I do hope that the events of the last couple of days do in some way demonstrate that Ireland is a country where the rules and the laws and standards and guidelines do apply to everyone equally.”Taoiseach Micheál Martin, was asked by reporters if Mr Varadkar was a good candidate for nomination for the EU Commissioner’s role, and replied: “Obviously he is a person of considerable calibre but, we haven’t discussed that.“The bottom line here is the three leaders are going to meet to discuss this entire situation. Nothing has been discussed in terms of any particular inidual, up to now, and we will have a meeting to discuss that.”Mr Martin said he discussed the situation with Dr von der Leyen this morning, but that he had “at no stage” had he sought “to influence her in terms of any deliberations in relation to this matter”.The Taoiseach said both he and Dr von der Leyen agreed that Mr Hogan “had made the correct decision” and that he would be holding a meeting Mr Varadkar and Green Party leader Eamon Ryan to discuss nominations.Mr Martin said Ireland was “very conscious” of “pressing” ahead with nominations and he was focussed on securing “a person of calibre to be nominated ultimately as a successor to Phil Hogan”.The Taoiseach and Tánaiste were speaking to reporters at the announcement of 400 jobs at US pharmaceutical firm Regeneron in Limerick.Earlier, Dr von der Leyen said that she had “respect” for Mr Hogan’s decision to resign, which came after days of discussions with him to establish his movements in Ireland in which it emerged he had not observed the 14-day period of self-isolation required for incoming travellers from Belgium.“Over the past days I discussed with Phil Hogan about his movements in Ireland, in light of information that emerged regarding respect of public health guidelines in Ireland,” the president said.“In the current circumstances as Europe fights to reduce the spread of the coronavirus and Europeans make sacrifices and accept painful restrictions, I expect the members of the college to be particularly vigilant about compliance with applicable national or regional rules or recommendations.”Dr von der Leyen said it was now up to the Irish Government to “present suitable candidates” to serve in the Commission for Ireland, and that she would ask for a man and a woman to be forward for her consideration.Achieving a gender balance among the commissioners was a goal set by Dr von der Leyen when she took up her post at the end of last year.Ireland is not guaranteed to retain the influential trade portfolio that Mr Hogan held as she can opt to reshuffle her cabinet, and this is understood to depend on the experience of the candidates put forward. Dr von der Leyen said she had not yet decided on the issue.“At a later stage I will decide on the final allocation of portfolios in the college of commissioners,” she said.In the interim, the trade brief will be managed by the Latvian official Valdis Dombrovskis, who is executive vice president of the European Commission.Second chanceMeanwhile, former German MEP Elmar Brok has said that Phil Hogan deserved a second chance and he had been the “perfect” trade commissioner.Speaking on RTÉ radio’s Today with Claire Byrne show Mr Brok said he very much regretted the resignation, but that nobody was so strong that they could not be replaced. “A second chance would have been a good thing.”Mr Brok said he could not predict if Ireland would keep the trade portfolio and that Mr Hogan had been chosen “on purpose” for the role.When asked about possible replacements, Mr Brok said former taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Simon Coveney or MEP Mairead McGuinness would be very strong candidates for the position.“But, they have no experience as a commissioner, as Phil Hogan had – still, someone from that circle might give Ireland a chance of keeping the trade portfolio.”Mr Brok added he hoped he could stay in personal contact with Mr Hogan and that the former commissioner could still play a role in pubic life. “He’s still a young man.”Dublin MEP Barry Andrews said he expects Dr Von der Leyen to appoint a woman to the trade role because she is very ambitious to achieve gender balance in the Commission.Speaking to RTÉ radio’s News at One Mr Andrews said the departure of Phil Hogan was “an enormous strategic loss for Ireland”.It had been inevitable when Mr Hogan had been “too slow” to apologise and after he “stood over his misinterpretation” of the Covid guidelines.Mr Andrews, who is a member of the Trade Commission, said it was a portfolio of enormous importance with “massive issues coming down the line.”Mr Hogan’s appointment as Trade Commissioner had been “an enormous triumph” for Ireland, he added.While he was against the appointment of “a technocrat”, if that was the cost, it would be worth it, he said.Nobody would want their name to go forward and not be successful, he said of the possible nominees."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Itinerary of three-week visit by investigators fuels concern over China\u0026rsquos co-operationBrenton Tarrant killed 51 Muslim worshippers at two mosques in New Zealand last yearLong-serving president already general secretary of the party and head of the militaryTed Hui and Lam Cheuk-ting detained as part of crackdown under new security lawVictims and relatives seek life without parole for man who killed 51 in 2019 attackResearchers say man had no Covid-19 symptoms the second time, suggesting immune system kept virus somewhat in checkLocals and police search the debris after five-storey structure crumbles in MahadLuon Sovath, who has spent decades fighting for human rights, was the victim of a vicious smear campaign this summerFears that country teetering on edge of major outbreak supported by data on rise in daily casesWhite supremacist killed 51 worshippers at two New Zealand mosques in March 2019Health condition \u0026lsquovery worrying\u0026rsquo after drinking tea that allies believe was laced with poisonDecision to transfer Kremlin critic ill with suspected poisoning after day of lobbyingProtests over last two months most serious threat yet to prime minister\u0026rsquos administrationLack of foreign visitors has facilitated increase in poaching and loss of revenueReport by US intelligence agencies sheds light on actions \u0026ndash and inactions \u0026ndash that created global crisisTens of thousands evacuated as record-breaking rains hit country\u0026rsquos southwestCountry entering dangerous new phase of rising infections in small towns and villagesUS president \u0026lsquopatently wrong\u0026rsquo when telling Minnesota crowd New Zealand situation \u0026lsquoterrible\u0026rsquoPolling put back by four weeks as 49 Covid-19 cases recorded in AucklandStudent-led demonstrations gain momentum testing laws protecting royal familyStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4335701.1598013937!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk time wasting makes deal unlikely says barnier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit negotiator Michel Barnier: “Frankly I am disappointed and I am worried.”  Photograph: Yves HermanPOOLAFP via Getty ImagesThe EU’s Brexit negotiator has warned that valuable time is being wasted in trade talks with the UK as he accused his British counterparts of failing to make progress on topics of key interest to Europe during the latest round of trade negotiations. Michel Barnier said he was disappointed, concerned and surprised by the lack of progress displayed in discussions that took place in Brussels this week, reiterating that at this stage an agreement between the two sides still looked unlikely and that there was a risk the two sides would fail to ratify a deal by the end of the year. “Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards,” Mr Barnier said at a press conference following the conclusion of the latest negotiations. “I simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time.” The failure to advance the discussions that began on Tuesday evening leaves only a narrow window in which to agree the text of a trade agreement, translate it into multiple European languages and obtain ratification before the post-Brexit transition period ends on December 31st. While both the UK and EU insist they want a deal, EU officials decried a lack of momentum on the British side in the wake of Thursday’s session, with one describing it as “puzzling”. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, acknowledged in a separate statement that there had been “little progress” during the week’s talks, but he also insisted that a deal remained possible even if it would not be easy to achieve.State aid and fisheriesThe EU wants the two sides to push towards a common understanding on the topics of state aid and fisheries, rather than leaving these highly sensitive topics until later in the talks, but British negotiators are seeking to advance to a legal text in other areas where the two sides are closer together.Lord Frost criticised the EU’s approach on Friday. “The EU is still insisting not only that we must accept continuity with EU state aid and fisheries policy, but also that this must be agreed before any further substantive work can be done in any other area of the negotiation, including on legal texts,” he said. “This makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress.”Mr Barnier complained that he was not seeing any willingness on the UK side to take on board the EU’s priorities, adding that the need for a “level playing field” that ensures fair competition in areas including state aid would not go away and was a non-negotiable precondition to any trade deal.“No international agreement was ever reached without the parties agreeing to common rules,” he said. The notion of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement without level playing field provisions and a balanced deal on fisheries was a “non-starter” for the EU, and the absence of progress in these areas was blocking everything, he warned.British negotiating officials said the talks were stalling due to the problematic issues of fishing and state aid, over which they accused the EU of seeking to maintain the status quo.“What is frustrating is that Barnier wants to see us continuing arrangements very like those we had as members of the EU. The principle of ‘Brexit means Brexit’ is a good one and should be applied across the board,” the official said.“The process block now is that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else. We’re obviously not going to do that, so we’re frozen.”Key concernsMr Barnier confirmed that the UK had presented a draft legal text for the trade deal during the round of talks, but he added that this had not addressed the EU’s key concerns, serving instead as a reminder of the UK’s existing positions.Lord Frost added that the UK was seeking a relationship that ensures Britain regains “sovereign control of our own laws, borders, and waters” and is similar to other agreements struck by the EU elsewhere. “When the EU accepts this reality in all areas of the negotiation, it will be much easier to make progress.” A dinner between Mr Barnier and Lord Frost was held on Thursday evening after negotiations concluded, which officials suggested was tense following the lack of progress. “It was a very nice dinner, we had courteous and friendly discussions but we didn’t hide the difficulties between us,” one inidual said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed top baby names england wales 2019 popular name","story":"It can be one of the most difficult decisions new parents have to make - choosing the name of your child which they will carry through life, shaping how they are perceived by their peers or even their opportunities in life.The question is  - do you play it safe and walk the tried and tested route or go out on a limb? An ordinary name that doesn\u0027t draw attention or something more outlandish?The Office for National Statistics (ONS) have now revealed the most popular baby names for last year, with detailed stats on exactly how many children were given each name in England and Wales.You can search for your name via the interactive tool below to see whether a name is going in or out of fashion.Did parents in 2019 beat Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds to the name Wilfred - which languished in 143rd place in the 2018 rankings of boys names with just 383 births?Amid the Royal fallout have British parents followed Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s lead after the birth of Archie last year? In previous years new parents in Britain have been generally reliable in their most common picks for the top names, and this year is no different.For the three years to 2018 Oliver and Olivia were crowned the most popular baby names in England and Wales, and this year they cemented that status.Oliver has been the most popular boys\u0027 name since 2013 while Olivia replaced Amelia in top place in 2016.Among the top boy\u0027s names Alfred, Chester, Hudson, Ibrahim and Oakley entered the 2019 top 100 - replacing Alex, Dexter, Dominic, Kai, Sonny and Tobias.Lara and Mabel replaced Aisha and Francesca in the top 100 girls’ names Mabel has not been in the top 100 since 1924.In 2019, Freya and Lily entered the top 10 replacing Ella and Emily. This is the first time Freya has been in the top 10 most popular girls’ names, while it is the first time Emily has not been in the top 10 since 1984. Margaret and Mary were the only girls’ names to have featured in the top 10 for a longer period of time than Emily.In contrast to the top 10 girls’ names, there were no new entries in the top 10 boys’ names. Arthur continued its recent rise, now at its highest position since records began in 1904 as the fourth most popular boys’ name, 11 years since returning to the top 100.The regional variation in top boys’ names continued in 2019 when, despite Oliver being the top name in England and Wales overall, it was only top in the East Midlands, the East of England, the South West and Wales.Muhammad remained the most popular boys’ name in the North West, Yorkshire and The Humber, the West Midlands, and London while Harry and Arthur were the most popular boys’ names in the North East and South East respectively. Of all the Arthurs born in England and Wales, a fifth were born in the South East.David Corps, vital statistics outputs branch at the ONS, said: “Oliver and Olivia continued their reign as the top boys’ and girls’ names in 2019, but analysis shows choices in baby names can differ depending on the mother’s age. We found younger mothers opted for more modern girls’ names like Harper, which has seen a rise since the Beckhams named their daughter so in 2011, and shortened boys’ names like Freddie. In contrast, older mothers chose more traditional names such as Jack and Charlotte.”Which names have been driven by celebrity and popular culture? Has the rise in popularity in some names been born out of new music and films, and which names have faded into obscurity?Since 2016, when the Amazon Alexa was first available in the UK, the girls’ name Alexa has decreased in popularity from 2016 when there were 332 girls named Alexa to just 39 in 2019.In contrast, a girls’ name that may have increased following the rise to fame of a celebrity is the name Dua. Dua Lipa, the popstar, had her first UK number one single in 2017. In that time, the number of girls named Dua has doubled from 63 in 2017 to 126 in 2019 this is the highest number since our annual records began in 1996.Similar trends have been seen in boys’ names where the name Taron has increased in popularity, with 48 boys born in 2019 being given this name, the most since detailed records began in 1996. This choice in name might be influenced by the actor Taron Egerton who starred in the 2019 award-winning Elton John biopic, Rocketman.Continuing the cinematic trends, the name Kylo appears to have increased in popularity since the release of the new Star Wars sequel trilogy. Kylo Ren, a leading character, first appeared in 2015. Since then, the number of boys named Kylo has risen from 10 to 67 in 2019.Despite the last season of Game of Thrones leaving fans disappointed, names from the fantasy series are still cropping up on birth certificates, with four girls named Daenerys in 2019.Looking back to 1996, when detailed annual rankings of baby names first became available, we have seen names rise and fall and some all but disappear completely.The first name Corbyn faded into obscurity in 2019, with fewer than two babies named Corbyn in the same year the former Labour leader crashed to a devastating election defeat.The ONS suppresses any figures fewer than two, and it is the first time there have been no entries for Corbyn since 1996. In 2018 12 baby boys were named Corbyn.The girls’ names Brittany and Kerry were reasonably popular 20 years ago, with Brittany the 101st most popular name in 1999, and Kerry was 136th in 1996. However, in 2019, there were two or fewer children given these names.There were similar cases for boys’ names. In 2019, there were two or fewer boys named Kieren or Glenn for the first time since our detailed annual rankings were first available in 1996.Kieren’s highest rank was in 1997 when it reached 169th position. The more popular spelling of this name, Kieran, has declined too, decreasing from 89th position in 2010 to 374th in 2019. Meanwhile, Glenn was once the 95th most popular boys’ name in 1964.The steepest fall from the top 100 boy\u0027s names in 1996 is the name MacAuley, which held 95th spot but has since fallen to rank 2,488, with eight births in 2019.For the first time this year there were no entries for the boy\u0027s name Neville, suggesting the name is facing extinction. There were also two or less baby girls named Debra, though there were four girls named Debbie.Other names thought to be extinct have clawed their way back this year - notably Nigel. Not a single baby had the name on their birth certificate in 2016, but last year nine new Nigels came into the world.  The statistics are derived  from the names as they appear on the birth certificate of the child and, as such, don\u0027t factor in differing or similar pronunciations. Grouping names with similar pronunciation would change the rankings.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 team three week mission china does not visit wuhan","story":"A World Health Organization team sent to China to investigate the origins of coronavirus did not visit Wuhan, where the pandemic first emerged late last year, sparking criticism.The WHO reiterated on Thursday that the two officials who visited China were part of an “advance mission” whose role was to lay the groundwork and terms of reference for the international investigation into the origins of Sars-Cov-2, which was agreed earlier this year.Dave Sharma, an Australian MP, told the Financial Times: “It is another disturbing incident of the WHO - which is charged with safeguarding global public health - putting the political sensitivities of a member state above the public health interests of the world”.  Australia lead calls in April for an international inquiry into the origins of Covid-19, which a Chinese envoy this week likened to Brutus betraying Julius Caesar. The US has also been critical of China\u0027s and the WHO\u0027s handling of the outbreak. The WHO said the visit to China had been successfully completed and a call asking all WHO member states to propose experts for the mission was expected to be issued shortly.Once selected, the international team is expected to visit China, including Wuhan, later this year, say WHO sources. Exact timings will depend on how long the selection process takes and travel conditions dictated by the progress of the pandemic.It is understood the two officials in the advance party had a “productive” trip.They were quarantined in a hotel outside Beijing for the best part of two weeks but conducted multiple calls daily with their Chinese counterparts. Further time was spent in meetings in Beijing.This included “extensive” discussions with their Chinese counterparts, including video conversations with senior scientists from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.Chinese scientists are gathering evidence and conducting preliminary research in cooperation ahead of the start of the investigation in cooperation with overseas counterparts. This is expected to be shared with WHO and the mission members once the investigation formally starts.The idea that two officials would visit Wuhan to sort out the origins of the disease before the terms of reference had been set or the members of the international team selected was fanciful, said sources.The investigation into the origins of the virus will be a herculean scientific effort which may never bear fruit. Most experts say so-called spillover events where animal viruses are picked up by humans are constantly happening. Most burn out naturally but a few explode.The most important thing in terms of preventing another pandemic, say experts, is not to pinpoint a precise event but to understand the environmental conditions - animal husbandry, supply chains, food processing etc - that increase the risk of a major outbreak.Many of the initial cases of Covid-19 were linked to a seafood market in Wuhan.Calls have grown for an inquiry into how the coronavirus pandemic began, and how exactly the bug jumped from animals to humans, as experts believe. More than 120 countries successfully pressed for an investigation into the origins of the outbreak in May during the World Health Assembly.China agreed to the inquiry, saying it would be appropriate only after the pandemic was brought under control, but didn’t specify how much access would be granted to experts.The inquiry has been politically charged, with the US and other nations blaming China’s cover-up and missteps for exacerbating a devastating virus outbreak that has now sickened more than 24 million people, and killed nearly 830,000.“This is a regime that failed to disclose information they had about a virus that’s now killed over 100,000 Americans, hundreds of thousands across the world, cost the global economy trillions and trillions of dollars,” Mike Pompeo, US secretary of state, said in July.As such, any WHO inquiry in China would be “completely, completely whitewashed,” he said, citing Beijing’s actions to destroy samples and silence whistleblowers.Beijing has pushed back against those claims and instead has focused on its success in containing the coronavirus.Beijing has also sought to win diplomatic points by selling medical and protective equipment to other countries, some of which has turned out to be faulty.China’s staunch defence of its coronavirus response – and ongoing diplomatic spat with Australia, which led the push for an investigation – means tensions remain high.China’s foreign ministry repeatedly deflected questions from foreign journalists about the itinerary and access granted while the WHO two-person team was visiting in July.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown has proved friendships need good edit","story":"Back in the strange, still, early days of lockdown, when the sun beat endlessly down from a blue and silent sky and I was woken up early every morning by the unnatural quiet, there was a sort of underlying frenzy that acted in contrast to the inertia of the days. It was the incessant sound of pings and beeps as our phones and computers went mad with WhatsApp messages and Zoom invitations.Trapped at home, with only immediate family for company (if we were lucky), the need to communicate with our wider networks became, for a time, incredibly urgent. This compulsion manifested itself in surprising, and sometimes delightful ways – my husband got up at 4.30 in the morning one day to dial into a Zoom check-in with two of his best buddies from university, one in Oregon, the other in Hong Kong, while a previously sporadic WhatsApp group with my oldest group of school friends morphed into a weekly Zoom hangout where we drank wine and competed on whose life had become the most boring.Zoom fatigue set in after a few weeks, and I got more discerning about who I wanted to communicate with. Some interactions, like my school pal chats, were genuinely life-affirming events that I looked forward to others highlighted the fact that real life acquaintances do not always pass the screen test. I was struck by how little I missed some people, and how much I came to rely on regular check-ins with others.So it’s perhaps not surprising that an Oxford University study has found that our friendships may have been irrevocably changed by lockdown, with full recovery only likely up to a full year after all this madness ends (i.e. possibly never). “Zoom is only a sticking plaster”, warns Robin Dunbar, the evolutionary psychology professor. “Nothing on Earth is going to stop a relationship quietly sliding away to being ‘somebody I once knew’ if you don’t, once in a while, meet up physically.”But as with Zoom, so with real life. As we resume something a little closer to the latter, and are allowed to see our friends again, there are definitely some people I’m prioritising others I’m less fussed about. Having always enjoyed a large and disparate group of pals, this whole shebang has forced me to work out which ones I truly value. But then, I’ve long believed that most things in life benefit from a good edit. Friends, it seems, are no exception.What’s the weirdest thing you bought during lockdown? I don’t mean the loo roll stockpile, or the extra pasta, but those impulsive, possibly\u2028 alcohol-fuelled purchases checked out in anticipation of a wholly new life. Research has found that nearly three quarters of us splashed out on something we later regretted, and an informal straw poll among friends threw up some interesting results.One pal’s partner invested in a bike helmet – despite not being in possession of a bike. Another bought an electronic ear wax remover from America, yet to be delivered. One friend has a large projector screen languishing unusable in her basement (it’s wider than her house) that would cost more in courier fees to return than she (drunkenly) paid for it in the first place. Perhaps most suspiciously, one (currently gainfully employed) friend invested in a lock-picking kit.

He alerted staff on the Ryanair flight to Pisa, who quickly ensured he was removed along with his companion.Their seats were sanitised, and the overhead lockers wiped, and after a delay of over an hour the flight still took off.After they were taken to an isolation area, they were put into the care of Public Health England. A spokesperson for Stansted airport explained: I can confirm we (as the airport) were made aware of the passenger by the airline and members of the airport’s fire service attended the aircraft and escorted the passenger (and travel partner) to an isolation area where they were put in contact with Public Health England, who then oversaw the passenger’s onward journey.The passenger likely breached coronavirus guidelines by leaving his home and boarding the flight those who have been tested because they have symptoms are instructed to remain at home and self-isolate until they receive the results of their test. The airline, Ryanair, insisted that other passengers were unlikely to have been at risk of catching the virus.It said in a statement: “A passenger who boarded a flight from London Stansted to Pisa on Wed 26 Aug, received a text message notification before departure that he had tested positive for Covid-19. The passenger \u0026amp his travel companion were immediately offloaded and taken to a Stansted Airport isolation area where they were assisted by local public health authorities. Since this passenger and his companion had complied fully with Ryanair health regulations, they were both wearing masks at all times at Stansted Airport and for the very short period (less than 10 mins) they were seated on the aircraft prior to departure. There was little if any risk of C19 transmission to other passengers or crew members as all of whom were also wearing face masks at all times. The aircraft departed for Pisa following a delay of 1hr 20 mins to allow for the empty seats and overhead cabin bins to be disinfected to comply with all UK health authority guidance.

If the Republicans lose the White House and control of the US Senate, as some polls suggest they will, a reckoning over the party\u0027s future seems inevitable. On the other hand, an election victory could cement the Republican Party\u0027s position as the party of Trump for years to come.But in the event of a resounding Trump victory, the president\u0027s natural successor may not be his deputy Mr Pence - but his eldest son, Donald Trump Jnr, who also addressed the convention this week.An articulate speaker, Donald Jnr has publicly hinted at his interest in a future run for office, and shares his father\u0027s talent for connecting with the party\u0027s voter base.The younger Mr Trump has previously been called Trumpier than Trump on account of his bellicose rhetoric and willingness to delve into controversies when it comes to his discussions of racial tensions and other sensitive topics.One thing is clear: win or lose, President Trump could play a decisive role in who succeeds him.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"interactive map reveals coronavirus cases rising local area","story":"People in England can use the Government tool to look up Covid- data for their local area.To visit the map website, click here.On mobile, enter your postcode, zoom in and click on the dot to reveal your local area.

Usually there is at least a soloist,not a full choir leading the audience, but of course this year the public seats in the hall will be empty because of the virus, and the voices on stage silenced.Now, the lyrics of both songs are pro-colonial. If you ban them from the Last Night of the Proms, ending a tradition going back decades, what consequences will that have Certainly, someone  years from now will say we shouldn’t have done that.It is the same argument for not taking down statues. If you remove statues because that person stands for something evil in their past, you are removing the deed too.Manipulating history only adds to mistrust among the black community.I would like to see the survey that says the public want these two songs taken out of the Proms programme, because it appears to me that the public hasn’t been consulted.Rule, Britannia! was written by Scottish poet James Thomson and he features on the famous Scott Monument in Edinburgh, near where I live.He is also commemorated in Westminster Abbey’s Poets’ Corner, next to William Shakespeare.If we say we must remove his words from the Proms, do we then remove the memorials too Rule, Britannia!, written and set to music in , was mentioned in James Joyce’s novel, Ulysses.

If we take it away, we take away part of my culture.It’s a song about the power structure at the time, and the arrogance and hypocrisy of Britain vowing to “never be slaves” while at the same time owning and benefiting from about , black chattel slaves in the West Indies who were called ‘property’.Of course, people are sensitive to its meaning, as well as Land Of Hope And Glory, the music of which was written by Edward Elgar.It doesn’t mean we should hide it.I personally don’t find the lyrics offensive because they are a true representation of the terrible truth at the time.If you take that away, then you are replacing history with a fairy story.There is also the possibility that it was written to show the evil of the time, rather than glorying it.The objection is that Rule, Britannia! is used by flag-waving “prommers” as a jubilant finale at the Proms.It is used in the wrong context, and that is part of the ignorance of our society of our history.It’s the same with Amazing Grace, which was written by a slaver of black people and is sung as a religious anthem.Recently, it was proposed that we should ban Swing Low, Sweet Chariot at rugby matches due to its link to slavery. That came to nothing.Instead of banning such songs or stripping away their lyrics, we need to educate people on the history of slavery, starting with putting it on the history curriculum.From speaking to people about slavery, the one constant reaction is always: “Why didn’t anyone tell us this before ”At the Proms, instead of taking the words away, we should put an explanation in the programme. We should tell people it’s about enslaving black people, making money from them, giving them a short le span and then compensating the slave owners when it was abolished because slaves were regarded as ‘property’.If they want to sing it after reading that, then fine, go ahead and sing it. But I bet they won’t sing it as joyfully as they might have done before.When I worked in research, I once had a lovely technician who worked for me. She looked after me so well, and she went to the Proms.If she knew the history of those two songs, being my friend, I doubt she would have sung along.It wasn’t her fault that she didn’t know the history.Those songs didn’t have a place in the Proms in the first place, they are there because of people’s ignorance. I would challenge anyone to know their meanings and still sing them in a frivolous capacity.But we shouldn’t be bothering ourselves about whether those songs should now be removed.What we should be bothering ourselves about is increasing the representation of black people who are the descendants of slaves. We should be concerning ourselves about making sure black people from the Windrush generation get compensation. And we should also be ensuring ourselves that every child is taught the history of slavery so that they can make their own minds up about whether to sing songs like these.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

At last, after an unprecedented lockdown of six months, all schools are due to re-open, representing a giant leap back towards normality. But the damage caused by the Coronavirus disruption has been severe.Many parents have been prevented from ing to work. Young people’s education has been badly undermined, especially because the quality of online learning has been so uneven. One study found that a fth of pupils had less than an hour’s instruction a day. Moreover, social activities and friendships – which are a vital part of growing up – have been heavily restricted.The exam chaos over the last fortnight was a fitting symbol of the vacuum created by the absence of proper schooling. No advanced society canwhen a vital sector like education is temporarily paralysed. That is why it is so important that the Government succeeds in its goal of seeing a fullto the classroom. As Boris Johnson put it at the weekend, “it is vital for pupils’ education. It is vital for their welfare. It’s vital for their physical and, indeed, mental well-being.”Given the Government’s mixed record on its management of the Covid crisis, this will be a big test. From the inadequate supply of protective gear to the botched imposition of quarantine rules, Ministers have got it badly wrong at times. They cannot afford another fiasco next week.But to do that, they will have to curtail the influence of militant teaching unions, which thrive in a climate of scare-mongering and grievance. Full of negativity, these hardened left-wing operators turn every pebble of dficulty into a giant boulder of obstruction. They are the abominable no men and women, the ultimate “can’t do” brigade.To overcome the unions’ capacity for trouble-making, reassurances about safety will be absolutely crucial. Most teachers are keen to go back to work, but they want to know schools will not be dangerous environments. That is why the recent upbeat advice from medical experts has been so welcome. It is clear from the Covid experience around the world that not only are children less likely to transmit the disease than any other group, but also that schools are safer than most other workplaces. Yesterday, the Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries pointed out that a child is more likely to be involved in a traffic accident or die from flu than to be harmed by Coronavirus.That message was also spelt out by her boss Chris Whitty, who said on Sunday that the damage to health caused by a continued schools lockdown is potentially greater than the impact of Covid. “The balance of risk is very strongly in favour of children going to school,” he declared, adding the chances of catching the disease “are incredibly small.” In fact, there is now hard evidence to prove this. Although the vast majority of schools were closed since March, over one million pupils – such as the children of essential workers – went back to the classroom in June. Yet a comprehensive study by Public Health England showed that in the subsequent weeks until the end of term, just  children and  staff tested positive for Covid- – and nearly all these infections occurred outside the school. There were hardly any cases of children passing on the disease to each other, or to their teachers. Other research from around the world has come to the same conclusion.But none of this seems to matter to the teaching unions, eager to exploit anxiety in pursuit of their anti-Tory agenda. These are the organisations which for decades have blocked every major reform of the education system and have defended every outdated working practice. With depressing inevitability, they have continually put their own narrow interests before the wider needs of pupils. They want the respect due to trained professionals but they frequently display the rebellious spirit of the permanent agitators. “Strike action is a very powerful tool,” said Amanda Martin, the President of the ,-strong National Education Unionin an interview with the Communist Morning Star newspaper in , adding, “I’ve run demos and rallies and worked with trade councils to bring everyone out and that’s brilliant.”Led by the NEU, the unions have brought the same attitude to the Coronavirus crisis. Instead of looking for solutions, they have endlessly exaggerated problems. One Whitehall insider says of Dr Mary Bousted, the £,-a-year joint general secretary of the NEU, “it’s all about the union, to hell with the teachers who want to get back into the classroom – let alone the children.” A left-wing radical, Bousted jokes that the word “strike” was one of the first she learnt as a child. Hers is not the voice of co-operation and enterprise, so it is hardly surprising that the Government has struggled to get schools reopened.In June, a planned majorwas thwarted by the unions, dealing a severe blow to Gavin Williamson’s credibility. One left-wing website gushed that the continued shutdown was due “to the hard work of NEU branch secretaries and rank and file militants galvanising the members.” In the months since, an alliance of unions – including Bousted’s NEU and Unite led by the notorious Merseyside militant Len McCluskey – have fought a y battle against a swt re-opening. Central to this effort at sabotage was a vast -point checklist of detailed questions which the Department for Education was told it had to answer. Dubbed by critics “a wreckers’ charter”, the list included queries such as “will lidded bins with double bagging be available in every classroom”, “will dedicated space be available for any breastfeeding women to express milk” and “has behaviour policy been reviewed to acknowledge the increased level of trauma and anxiety experienced by pupils ” Some Tories complained that the union was playing politics. Robert Halfon, the chairman of the Education Select Committee was amazed at the warped priorities: “It is incredible that not one of these nit-picking questions asks the most important thing of all – what’s best for the kids ”Even as September approaches, the whining and resistance has not ceased. “The unions need to stand firm and protect their members,” argues socialist teacher Martin Powell-Davies. In the latest ruse, the public sector outfit UNISON not only wants its members to wear masks in the classroom – something for which there is no scientic evidence of any need – but also to have extra funding for deep cleaning. “Schools need more money to pay for specially trained cleaners, rather than relying on other staff who are busy enough already,” says Jon Richards, UNISON’s head of education. The moan about over-stretched budgets is a favourite of the union movement but it is an empty accusation. The Government is pouring an extra £. billion into education, while this summer it was announced that teachers’ pay is to go up by an average of . per cent, a bigger increase than any other public sector workers received.But that did nothing to stop the combination of whingeing and shroud-waving. The mentality of the hardliners was embodied in a recent statement from the NEU’s far left “Education Solidarity Network” which set out a series of demands to “make sure safety comes first.” Among them were: “smaller class sizes to allow adequate physical distancing” arrangements “for rotas and home learning to be produced in consultation with parents” “local risk assessments to include staggered outdoor breaks, sanitising, provision of transparent coverings to enable access to lip reading and facial expression” and “weekly onsite testing of staff”. Above all, the Network called for extra funding “to implement these measures.” If there were any question of a risk to safety, the union should “prepare for a national strike ballot.”That was so typical. This lot seem to feel more comfortable on the picket line than in the classroom. The Solidary Network might be seen as extreme, but its carping outlook runs right through the unionYesterday, the NEU’s joint general secretary was bleating on the airwaves about the risks of new Covid spikes: “Staff, parents and pupils are being sorely let down by the government because of a lack of a Plan B and of ensuring robust track and trace is in place throughout the country. We believe the Government is negligent in the extreme.” The charge of negligence might be applied with more force to the NEU, whose hostile stance has made thesuch an exhausting obstacle course.

It was am on a Monday morning and virtually empty.Little wonder when the ­government guidance says retailers must “discourage customers from handling products while browsing, and keep fitting rooms closed”.One store let me try on a dress then sanitised the cubicle afterwards, another told me thatI tried something on they would have to then take it off display for  hours.In LK Bennett, the fitting rooms were closed and I askedI could try on a blouse over my clothes, just to seeit actually fits. No, they said, you have to buy the item, take it home to try it on, then bring it backit doesn’t fit. Needless to say, I ed home empty-handed.So,our High Street clothes shops are to survive the pandemic, two things need to happen.Unless classed as vulnerable, those of us who actually enjoy clothes ­shopping need to get back out there as soon as possible and actively support them. And the Government needs to relax its strict rules and let retailers and shoppers take inidual responsibility for what happens in store.If I have to wear a mask and gloves to try on a pair of jeans in a cubicle, then I’m happy to do so.

Because I need to protect myself, obviously. But I also have my med kit.The reporter said that a business they stood near had been lit on fire the previous night as riots raged.Facebook has now said it is investigating a ,-member group called Kenosha Guard, which reportedly promoted an event encouraging armed civilians to take to the streets to defend the city on TuesdayThe Milmaukee Journal Sentinel noted that based on Wisconsin law, Rittenhouse is being charged as an adult.The shooting reportedly began just after midnight as a group of protesters faced off police in riot trucks on Sheridan Road.The lead up isnt clear, but police think the first shooting may have resulted from a gas station conflict.Cops said self-styled militias were defending local businesses from looters.Witness Koerri Elijah told Insider that the person who carried out the shooting appeared to be on edge beforehand.I noticed him the entire time. He didnt seem like he was there with anyone, Elijah said.He was armed. He didnt seem like he was a threat, but I thought maybe I should keep an eye on him.Devin Scott, , told the Chicago Tribune he was in a group chanting Black Lives Matter when the gunfire began and that he tried unsuccessfully to revive one of the victims.This guy with this huge gun runs by us in the middle of the street and people are yelling, He shot someone! He shot someone! he said.And everyone is trying to fight the guy, chasing him, and then he started shooting again.Scott said he hit the ground during the next burst of gunfire, then tried to aid a person who was lying prone in the street.He added: I was cradling him in my arms. I was trying to keep this kid alive and he wasnt moving or nothing. He was just laying there.Carol Badoni, , from Burlington, Wisonsin, spoke to the girlfriend of one of the victims.“He definitely was not breathing,” she said.“His eyes were rolled back in his head. There was no pulse.”But she added that she saw no blood, before cops arrived and took the man to hospital.In another clip, a man was seen removing his top to help another victim of the shooting.People on the streets were also seen dragging the injured to the side of the road and performing CPR.A protester who had reportedly been shot in the head was loaded into the back of an SUV and rushed to a nearby hospital.Hours before Rittenhouse was identied as a suspect, social media sleuths named him and posted his picture online.https:twitter ShelbyTalcott status https:twitter ShelbyTalcott status Speaking about the unrest, Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul said: The violence and destruction that took place in Kenosha last night was despicable.While the two people who were killed and the person who was injured by gunfire have not yet been identied, we are thinking of their destroyed futures and their friends and families that must live with this overwhelming grief.Meanwhile, other protests erupted across the country in response to the Jacob Blake shooting.Police in Portland, Oregon, declared a gathering of hundreds of anti-racism protesters outside City Hall as a riot, ordering the crowd to disperse or face arrest.People at the Kenosha protest were heard shouting: Theres people getting shot everywhere.Kenosha has been riddled with violence, looting, criminal damage and fires since Blakes death on Sunday.Blake was shot as he stepped into his car after being unsuccessfully tasered and scuffling with officers attempting to arrest him in relation to a domestic violence dispute.Three of his sons were in the car at the time.On Tuesday, Blakes family confirmed that he is still alive but in a critical condition and is paralyzed.Jacob Blake Sr. said: They shot my son seven times. Seven times. Like he didnt matter. But my son matters. Hes a human being and he matters.While his family have pleaded for peaceful protests, they have hit out at police, saying they systematically brutalize black people.Police attempted to close off Kenosha after Monday nights protests led to buildings being set on fire and stores looted.Seven exit ramps were shut on Interstate- from the Illinois border to Racine, Wisconsin, which is about  minutes north of Kenosha.In downtown Kenosha, a huge crowd of protesters gathered around the barrier at Kenosha County Courthouse.One protester, Nathan, , who didnt want to give his full name said: A lot of fear in the air because of threats to protesters.“I worry a lot about the misinformation,” he said after explaining he didnt think national movement to bring greater police accountability will lead to real change.Although, he said locally, his city would never be the same.“It’s hard to see now, but it will be a positive thing,” he said of the protests.“It’ll bring Kenosha back together. Kenosha has always been a resilient place. It’ll continue to happen.”Thousands joined the protest on Tuesday, with some carrying handguns, AR- rles, knives and dressed in military flak jackets.Dennis, , from Racine, was carrying a pistol he claimed was for protection for himself and other protesters.“Nothing is going to change,” he said, hanging back from the crowd.“This is all for nothing.”One incident saw a group of the protesters violently shake a police barrier and launch fireworks at officers.Cops were seen firing tear gas pellets and rubber bullets into the crowd.One officer was heard shouting: Yall better have gas masks on! Get ready!Another cop was seen opening the hatch of the vehicle and throwing the canister in their direction.Another man was heard shouting: F**king p**sies!By pm  police officers dressed in riot gear formed a chain across the park near the citys courthouse.There were  fires associated with the unrest, with  businesses destroyed or damaged along with an unknown number of residences, Kenosha Fire Chief Charles Leipzig told the Kenosha News.On Tuesday, President Donald Trump urged Wisconsin officials to call in the National Guard to quell the unrest, despite troops already being on the ground.Governor should call in the National Guard in Wisconsin. It is ready, willing, and more than able. End problem FAST! he tweeted.On Monday, residents with firearms were seen standing outside local businesses in a bid to stop the looting and arson.One of the armed men in the footage taken Monday night says: Theyre destroying their own neighborhood.

Never mind that there has been no recorded case of a schoolkid passing on the virus to a teacher.Never mind that our economy needs the schools fully open with a proper, normal, timetable, so people can get back to work.After six months of no lessons , the kids now have to endure insufferable conditions at school.This is because Boris and the rest have proved utterly incapable of standing up to the teaching unions .Other U-turns have involved the wearing of masks in shops, the usefulness of masks in general, whether there’s any point in closing our borders, the schools due to re-open in June, the scrapping of an expensive track and trace system, the re-grading of GCSEs and A levels . . . oh lordy, the list goes on and on.Sometimes the U-turn appears only a day after the original decision.Sometimes we have to wait a week or so. But come they surely do, a long parade of staggering ineptitude. In fact, I think even Frank Spencer would have been more decisive. Maybe the right comparison is with Benny from Crossroads. Yes, it’s my age again. For those who don’t know, Benny was a cast-iron moron.We know that dealing with this horrible pandemic can’t have been easy. We know Boris has had a dficult year.But the utter lack of planning and resolve has been astonishing. Slow to take the virus seriously, bizarrely refusing to close our airports at the peak of the outbreak, hopelessly lost over track and trace and what do with our poor kids.This has been mismanagement on an almost heroic level. My guess is that Boris will not survive as Prime Minister: His party will get shot of him when the opportunity arises. Because here’s the crucial, damaging question.Could Jeremy Corbyn have handled this crisis any worse I DON’T think those smug monkeys at the BBC realised the fury they would unleash when they banned singing our favourite anthems at The Last Night Of The Proms.A petition reached , names in just  hours.And Dame Vera Lynn is suddenly at No in the iTunes chart with Land Of Hope And Glory.The BBC apparently agreed with the Finnish conductor, Dalia Stasevska, that the “jingoistic” words of Land Of Hope And Glory and Rule Britannia would not be heard this year.I wonder what convinced Ms Stasevska to agree to conduct an evening of patriotic songs when she hates patriotic songs Money, you would guess. Meanwhile another BBC bureaucrat, Cat Lewis, likened singing the songs to Nazis singing about gas chambers.Silly woman. The BBC – its entire staff – has no understanding of the British people. It despises them. Support for the corporation is at an all-time low. And yet the BBC is still up to its tricks. Pulling off the unusual feat of being already in a coffin, but reaching out somehow to hammer more nails into its own lid.A TEAM of British scientists has been studying dreams and what they mean.And they’ve discovered they mean sod all. They are just a continuation of memories from the previous day.Other recent studies showed the same thing. So,you dream you’re flying around your house with some bats, it means you were probably thinking about bats when you were awake.It doesn’t mean you’re neurotic or sexually repressed. So – that’s all the work of Sigmund Freud in the bin. It can go in a black bin liner along with the idiocies put forward by that other drongo of the th Century, Karl Marx. But given that we know all this, why are there still psychoanalysts plying their trade  Is it just to give Britain’s couch-makers plenty of work ANOTHER stupid, virtue-signalling British firm has run into trouble.Avanti West Coast made a big fuss about its new “pride train”, which runs from London to Manchester.The engine is painted in the colours of the LGBT rainbow flag.And it has the word “Pride” written in big letters – just in case anyone doesn’t get the message. There have been thousands of angry comments on social media.My favourite was from John James McGivern: “As a gay man, I don’t want a ‘pride train’, I just want to get on a train that runs on time like everyone .” Quite. Well said.Every time companies pull a stunt like this, the nation cringes.I don’t want a bloody voucher. You cancel the train I’m booked on, then refund the ticket.So I complain to them and they say nothing we can do.So I complain some more and tell them they’re acting illegally.Bingo – money back! I know a lot of people have had similar problems with airlines cancelling their flights and offering “vouchers”.It pays to pester these buggers. Pester and pester until they give in.POOR old slabhead, then. Manchester United’s Harry Maguire found himself uttering the most stupid words in the English language.“Do you know who I am ” And then explained to the Greek police officers who had arrested him that he was “very rich”. Then he tried to bribe them.⚠️Click here for the latest news on Harry MaguireGod help us all.I have always admired Maguire’s heading ability.It now seems to me that he gets so much force behind each header because he has reinforced concrete between his ears. Footballers are not renowned for being terribly bright.But Maguire has lowered the bar still further.One of the problems is the one to which the footballer alluded. He has too much money. So much that he doesn’t know what to do with it.And as a result is completely insulated from the real world. And when he does venture out into the real world it is to be continually abused by halfwits who do not like the club he plays for.Say sorry to the Greeks, Harry. And then shut up and play football.Andlouts give you abuse in the street, just smile at them.CHILDREN from working families were much better behaved during lockdown, according to a study from three British universities.I know that will come as news to some of you.A lot of kids seemed to be climbing the walls out of sheer boredom.

Nicola hadnt worn cream due to the grey clouds while sitting on the top deck of her cruise ship, but the shins on both her legs burst into blistering burns.The -year-old claims the pain was the worst shes ever experienced - even though shes been through two hip replacements and childbirth.The new bride had left suncream in her bag in the cabin after heavy cloud cover and choppy winds cancelled the cruises exertions in the Bahamas, West Indies, for the day.Nicola and husband Stephen Law sat on the top deck chatting with pals without sun cream on - with the mum-of-ones celtic complexion leaving her vulnerable to sun damage.When Nicola woke up the following morning, she immediately collapsed after getting out of bed as shooting pains made her knees buckle and left her in the worst pain ever.Enormous blisters erupted over both her shins which were so big the outlines were visible through her jeans.The terried mum was forced to burst the blisters before walking through airport security for fear that security guards would pull her to one side to find out what she had in her trousers.The wounds produced so much liquid that Nicolas shoes were squelching and she was making puddles so had to buy sanitary pads to soak up the moisture during the six-hour flight.She was in so much agony she needed a wheelchair to get through Dublin airport once she landed.But the complacent mum still dismissed it as regular sunburn - until Stephen, , was urged by a pharmacist to take his we to AE immediately.Now Nicola is speaking out about her ordeal to warn others to take proper precautions in the sun - and to not underestimate sun damage through the clouds.Nicola, from Lisburn, Northern Ireland, said: Ive had two full hip replacements and given birth naturally, and the pain from this was  times worse than any of them. Ive never known pain like it. It was so intense.Ive been sunburned loads of times because I fry dead easily. Usually I do the aftersun and usual moaning and groaning and tell myself off for being stupid. But never has it been that bad.My husband had to help me stand up to go to the toilet or anything. Once I was moving I was okay but standing up when the pain went right up your leg, I buckled a few times because it was that bad.The blisters got so big that you could see the outline of them through my trousers.By this stage I just wanted to go home and I was afraid of the airport security either thinking I was hiding something or not letting me fly.I burst the blisters, which I found out afterwards was the worst thing I couldve done. The liquid that poured out of me, my shoes were squelching. I was leaving puddles when I was walking.I ended up going into a shop in the airport and buying a pack of sanitary towels and a pair of long socks and putting the sanitary towels inside the socks to catch the fluid from my legs.That flight was the longest, most intense flight of my le. It was terrible. We were cramped in one place and my legs were just throbbing.I had to be wheelchaired off the plane to the front of the airport to get my lt because by this point I couldnt physically walk.Doctors diagnosed Nicola with second-degree burns and even contemplated using skin grafts to repair the damage.But luckily, after four days in the burns unit and doctors cleaning and changing her wounds daily, she was allowed tohome on March   without surgical intervention.Nicola claims she has kept her legs covered up ever since and applies factor  sun cream as often as she can - but still feels guilty for ruining the end of her honeymoon.Nicola said: The consultant asked me how long I had been in the sun and he said he couldnt believe how much damage I had done in such a short space of time.He wouldve thought that I had fallen asleep in it or been out in it for hours. He said it was because I was on the top deck so I was closer to the sun.We were out at sea so we had the salty air and the breeze coming at you as well. He said thats actually worse than being in the glaring sun. I didnt know that at the time. I thought because it was cloudy [I would be fine].I knew once I was on the beach I would need the sunscreen, but because the weather was so bad and it was so cloudy and windy, I thought I dont need it yet so I will put it on later as it warms up.It was ignorance and stupidity on my part. I still feel guilty now because I feel like I ruined the last half of our honeymoon.My legs havent seen daylight since then, which was two and a half years ago. Ill never take that risk again. Even though theyve healed, in cold weather they will sting.Thats a good sign apparently as it means the nerves are still alive in my legs.GOT a story  EMAIL exclusive@the-sun Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He said: “I know those dolphins, I swim with dolphins every day. It’s heartbreaking seeing them like this. It’s like deaths in the family.”Other dolphins stranded on shore appeared seriously ill, environmental consultant Sunil Dowarkasing said.Mr Dowarkasing saidL This is a terrible day. We are seeing these dolphins swim up to the shore in distress and then die, said Dowarkasing, a former member of parliament. We have never seen deaths of these very intelligent marine mammals like this. Never. More dolphins may have died out at sea and tests will be done to determine the cause of death of those found on shore.Dowarkasing theorised the creatures were either killed by the toxic oil seepage or chemicals in the bow of the sunken ship, which polluted Mauritius pristine waters.The Japanese bulk carrier MV Wakashio ran aground on a coral reef near the eastern coast of Mauritius on July . Pounded by the surf for days, the ships hull cracked and on August  it began leaking fuel into the waters of the Mahebourg Lagoon, fouling a protected wetlands area, mangroves and a small island that was a bird and wildle sanctuary.The ship later broke in two and the bow, the smaller of the two pieces, was towed out to sea and sunk.The ships captain and first officer have been charged with endangering safe navigation. Its not yet clear why the ship strayed miles off course, with the environmental group Greenpeace calling for an investigation. This is a deeply sad and alarming day for the people ofMauritius and for its singular bioersity, said Happy Khambule, Greenpeace Africas senior climate and energy campaign manager.The long-term impacts of the oil spill will likely affect whales, turtles, seabirds and much of the marine le in the area, Greenpeacewarned.Results from an autopsy conducted on of the dolphins found on Wednesday are expected later today. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As a result, very few people watch it — but it’s the toast of Beeb journos and left-wing social media, giving it undeserved influence over our daily news agenda.Despite her dressing-down over that outrageous Dominic Cummings monologue, Emily Maitlis is considered untouchable by executives. No one dares warn her that constant unbalanced questioning of Tory politicians and right-wing commentators is putting the very future of the Beeb under threat.And then there’s Lewis Goodall, the left-wing operative turned Newsnight policy editor who last week was allowed to author a feature for the New Statesman magazine headlined: “Failed. How the Government’s ineptitude created a lost generation.”As Theresa May’s former communications chief Sir Robbie Gibb put it: “Is there anyone more damaging to the BBC’s reputation for impartiality than Lewis Goodall ”I’ve read the thinly veiled left-wing think piece so you don’t have to.Goodall’s main thesis is to try to link the Covid-created A-level exams situation to the Windrush scandal.If it had been written by Owen Jones in the , I’d understand.But a full-time BBC staff member who we are consistently told is an impartial journalist, with no bias against the Government  Puh-lease!

Thanks for the support.”That revelation came one day after Meghan made her first intervention into this year’s US election, with a not-at-all-subtle anti-Trump message to American voters, suggesting: “We all know what’s at stake this year”.I have long been told by those close to her that Meghan harbours political ambitions and would one day like to end up in elected office.Which is absolutely fine.But to continue to use the Duchess title and represent the Queen on the Commonwealth Trust is highly inappropriate.I’d have great respectshe would cut the cords entirely and become a political activistwithout causing a massive diplomatic headache for the Royal Family.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mass redundancies are being announced with grim regularity, and I fear we will see more unless the government urgently changes course. The furlough scheme, a leline during the coronavirus crisis for many, is now being withdrawn from all businesses, whatever their circumstance. That blanket approach completely ignores that some sectors and regions have been much harder hit than others. Since August, employers have been required to pay for the pension and national insurance contributions of their furloughed staff. And in just three days, from September , employers across the country will also be required to pay % of the salary of their furloughed employees. That rule applies to all businesses across the board. Whether your business is trading well, whether it’s slowly recovering but still struggling, or whether it cannot operate properly or at all due to local lockdown restrictions, the furlough leline is being pulled away, come what may. It’s clearly illogical and unfair to treat every business in this unorm way. * What do you think  Do you agree  Have your say in the comments below Hospitality, retail and key manufacturing industries have been particularly hard hit by job losses, with thousands already announced and more predicted by trade bodies. Some businesses, such as night clubs, are still totally locked down. They are rightly following the public-health measures and are therefore unable to bring in any income, yet are being asked to paythey want to protect their employees’ jobs. The government is also failing to recognise that its approach could mean making this country more unequal with parts of the UK still under local lockdowns, and some areas of the UK having more of the businesses that have been worst affected by the crisis. It would be far better to be targeting those sectors that really need the help than offering £, to every business next February for every worker they take back off furlough. That policy means an awful lot of money is being spent on workers who would have been rehired anyway in sectors that are recovering after lockdown. Germany and France have schemes in place enabling workers to be put on part-time working and have the rest of their wage subsidised. Extended support, targeted at key sectors, could work in a similar way. The government has said they cannot save every job, but in taking this rigid approach, they are washing their hands of every livelihood still under threat. Plan to care  There’s been a % rise in the number of children needing foster care during this pandemic, and Labour has called for a proper plan from government to ensure children moving into the care system can access the support they need. On this week’s episode of my podcast Reasons to be Cheerful, we talk with the poet and writer Lemn Sissay about My Name is Why – his powerful memoir about growing up in the care system. Lemn talks about his -year battle to access his records and why it was so important to tell his story. Zombie horror  Boris Johnson this week blamed the A-level exam fiasco on a “mutant algorithm”. It does make you wonder whether this government will ever take responsibility for anything. He’d previously said the results system was “robust” as did Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. Distress was caused to so many young people, and the government can’t even say the buck stops with them. It feels much more a case of a zombie government than a mutant algorithm to me. Grants clawback will hit jobs    High streets across the country have been hit hard by this pandemic. We’ve seen waves of job losses from household names like MS, WH Smith, Pizza Express, John Lewis and Boots. And while retail sales overall are rebounding, sales at department stores and clothing shops are still down on pre-pandemic levels. More than a billion remains unused of the Government’s business grants funds, with many thousands of firms having been locked out of support. But the Business Secretary wants local councils tothat money by the end of the month. That can’t be right when so many firms are still struggling. Labour has called for that underspend to be turned into a Hospitality and High Streets Fightback Fund, with restrictions eased so more businesses can access the funding they need. Clawing that money back rather than redeploying it flexibly means ministers risk accelerating the jobs crisis. We must do everything we can to protect our country’s vital city centres and prevent shuttered high streets. Time to invest in going green    Climate change is a massive long-term threat to the country. To tackle the threat means we will need to change the way we power our homes, move around our towns and cities, and use our land. This may sound daunting and it is, but there is also a chance to ensure that in tackling that threat we can create a better economy and quality of le for people. That’s what I am determined we do as a country. Think of all the jobs that need doing, from insulating homes to building the zero carbon engines of the future to planting trees and creating green spaces that we can all enjoy. Britain can have a bright manufacturing futurewe take a lead in the environmentally friendly jobs of the future. It makes environmental and economic sense. At a time when we are facing an unemployment emergency, this is the moment to power forward with action to create those jobs we badly need. It’s what we have seen in other countries. Germany has already announced €bn worth of plans, with France likely also to invest a signicant amount. So far, the Government’s warm words on the need for a green recovery have not been matched by their deeds. The £bn of green investment announced pales in comparison. We owe it to ourselves to build back better, and we owe it to future generations to tackle the climate emergency. That’s why Labour has been talking to businesses, unions, workers, campaign groups and the public about ideas to kickstart a recovery that builds an environmentally sustainable economy with a zero carbon army of workers. We need a Green Recovery worthy of the name. Campaign aims to protect us all    Labour’s Jobs, Jobs, Jobs campaign aims to fight for jobs, keep workers safe and back businesses. Fight for jobs: by reforming the furlough scheme so it supports those in the worst-hit sectors and targets aid to struggling industries. Back our businesses: by setting up a fightback fund to prevent firms going under and save our high streets.

Staff have given up their summer to make sure children will get the education they deserve in a Covid-secure environment. The achievement is all the more impressive given they had to deal with the exams grading chaos at the same time.They deserve our thanks – unlike the Government, which has sent out confused and conflicting messages to parents, teachers and pupils.  There remains a lack of guidance from the Department for Education on what schools should dothere is a second wave in autumn. During lockdown too many pupils missed out by not having access to laptops and lessons via video calls. This cannot be allowed to happen againthere are further outbreaks. Yet the Government has failed to set out how children and teachers will be supported in such a situation. Teachers deserve high grades for their efforts this summer – but ministers should be placed in detention. Trump shame To British eyes it is shocking that a -year-old is allowed to own an assault rle. Even more grotesque is that Kyle Rittenhouse reportedly used that weapon to kill two protesters demonstrating against the police shooting of a black man in Kenosha, Wisconsin. What is less surprising is that Rittenhouse is a fanatical Donald Trump supporter. Rather than seek to calm tensions raging across the US, the President has sought to exploit them.Guest speakers at this week’s Republican convention included the two lawyers from St Louis who brandished guns at Black Lives Matters marchers. Trump may not be directly responsible for the Kenosha deaths but he is responsible for fanning the flames of hatred in his supporters.

Dorothy Sivyer and Kathleen Whitehead moved in together at the start of lockdown to keep each other company so they were able to sing Happy Birthday to each other. The pair - who call themselves aposThe Twinniesapos - were born in  and despite their dferent personalities, the pair from Rochester, Kent, said they have never quarrelled. Eldest by a few minutes, Kath worked as a radar operator during WW, and while she was once engaged, has never married or had children. But Dotty, a radiographer who treated soldiers ing from the Normandy beaches, is a widow with three children, six grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren. They put their long le down to balancing wine and chocolate with exercise, healthy food and a big group of female friends. Retired physicist assistant Dotty, who lived in Tunbridge Wells until recently, said: I came up here because of the lockdown to be with my sister and now weaposre both turning  together. Itaposs been nice living together during lockdown. We havenapost come to blows or anything! I donapost mind turning . Nobody has got this old in our family before. Weaposre having a garden party under a marquee with family and our friends are coming for morning coffee but theyaposll be in the garden to keep distance because of the virus. Kath, a retired primary school teacher, said: Weaposve had a lovely time together. Itaposs been good and we want to say thank you to all those people who have made our birthday so happy and nice.  Being together has kept us positive whilst staying inside - and eating chocolate! We play cards together and just chat a lot. We canapost do much about turning , can we  It just kind of comes, doesnapost it, I donapost really want it - Iaposd rather go back the other way! We are the oldest identical twins in Britain which is nice! Dotty and Kath were born in Chatham. Kent, in  and loved catching the tram with their parents to have picnics by the river as children. They had just turned  years old when World War Two was declared in  and both sisters did their bit for their country. Kath said: Weaposve seen lots of changes in our lives.  The war came just as we were of an age where we wanted to enjoy le. I was called up in the services in the West to be a radar operator so I did my bit in the war. It was quite an exciting time. Dotty added: We wanted to go out with our parents to parties and we loved going to the dances. Our teenage years were our favourite time. Youaposre just an adult, youaposre doing adult things, not childish things - youaposre free to do what you want and go where you want. I was a radiographer in a London hospital and I was sent down to Winchester to X-ray the casualties coming from the Normandy beaches. Throughout the past century the twins have gone on lots of holidays, visiting most of Europe, as well as Canada and through Scandinavia.  Kath said: We went right up to the North Pole and saw lots of reindeer standing there, looking at us and wondering who these strange people are! Weaposve been to glaciers like the Mortarach in Switzerland. Weaposve been to Spain loads of times and went to the Netherlands. Weaposve travelled around quite a bit. Dotty was married before her husband passed away and has a large family. Kath was once engaged but never married and has lived at her current home since she was  years old after it was built by the twinsapos grandparents. Kath said: Weaposve always got on very well. Never quarrelled, very close. We buy the same things and we share everything. Even when we are miles apart, we do the same things and buy the same handbags.  I bought a pair of shoes once and she bought the same in a dferent colour! Dotty said: Weaposre not friends - weaposre closer than that. Real sisters, real close, we are. Always have been. Dottyaposs daughter Margaret, , said: Mum has a brilliant mathematical mind. Sheaposs very technical so in her s she was Skype-ing us and sending messages on the computer. Aunty Kath used to create these beautul paintings and is always singing. She loves music and she sings such funny songs. Theyaposve got a funny sort of silly side and have a laugh but theyaposre also both very intelligent. The pair said their secret to a long and happy le is everything in moderation and a huge group of girlfriends.

The vast majority are in the south and Midlands, figures from Public Health England reveal - following warnings that virus hotspots were moving south. Redditch, in Worcestershire, has seen its rate treble in the seven days to Sunday. Kettering, in Northamptonshire, also experienced a sharp rise, with the number of new infections nearly doubling in a week, while the current rate in Mid Devon is ten times higher than it was the previous week. Oxford, where  infections were confirmed, has seen its rate rocket from . cases per , to . - prompting warnings of lockdown measures. In a statement to people living in the city, Ansaf Azhar, Oxfordshire County Council’s director for public health, said: Do we really want to end up with the kind of local control measures we have seen introduced in ious parts of Lancashire, Yorkshire, Leicester and Aberdeen  “At the minute it feels like we are moving in that direction. People need to be aware their behaviour is putting themselves and others at risk. If you’re aged  to  and catch Covid-, you are absolutely not guaranteed to get away with the mildest symptoms. Areas that have seen Covid- ratesrocket include:Rochdale - ., up from .Oxford - ., up from .Redditch - ., up from .Kettering - ., up from .Hackney and City of London - ., up from .Windsor and Maidenhead - ., up from .Blaby - ., up from .Dacorum - ., up from .Newcastle-under-Lyme - ., up from .Ealing - ., up from .South Bucks - ., up from .Wandsworth - ., up from .Southwark - ., up from .Bath and North East Somerset - ., up from .Folkestone and Hythe - ., up from .Mid Devon - ., up from .South Tyneside - ., up from . Councillor Sara Rowbotham, cabinet member for health and wellbeing at Rochdale Borough Council, said: Increasing numbers of people who are testing positive for coronavirus have no symptoms so we encourage everyone to get tested.We need to identy who has the virus so we can stop it spreading. Latest data shows a sharp fall in hotspots including Leicester, Northampton, Oldham, Blackburn and Pendle.But the government has been accused of being confused and bungled in its lockdown messaging by council leaders in West Yorkshire. The leaders of Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees have joined their counterparts in Greater Manchester in criticising proposals to tackle the virus on a ward-by-ward basis. Another announcement on restrictions in parts of Greater Manchester, east Lancashire and West Yorkshire is due to be made on Friday after Thursdayaposs meeting of the Joint Biosecurity Centrechaired by Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Englandaposs chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty. Last week, Mr Hancock announced a more targeted approach to Covid- restrictions in which the views of MPs would also be sought to gain the maximum possible local consensus.  He added this would allow local councils to focus resources on the wards which need more targeted intervention in order to drive infection rates down. In a statement, councillors Susan Hinchclfe, Tim Swt and Shabir Pandor, the leaders of Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees respectively, said: Our infection rates have come down signicantly this week, although they are still high. Over the last few months and weeks we, as leaders, have taken dficult decisions and directed signicant resource in our councils to make this happen. However, throughout this time Government messaging has been confused and bungled.  The latest sht in Government messaging that happened last week was that they inferred they wanted to see more localised restrictions, ying them ward by ward rather than by local authority areas. To add to the confusion, Government want to review and change these place by place weekly, leading to inconsistency in restrictions across the North. In the latest guidance from Government there is a presumption that wards with a low number of cases will start to revert to the national restrictions this week.

The house, belonging to -year-old Paul, had to be cleaned by specialists after piles of rubbish and mountains of collections reached the ceiling. His bathroom and kitchen had been completely unusable for years but Paul said he got around this by eating outside, going to cafes and going where to have a shower. Paul and his mother bought the three bedroom house in Crosby, Merseyside,  years ago, after his father died, for £,. On Channel  documentary Hoarders, which airs on Thursday night, he said: We had a nice modern kitchen, nice garden as well, it was a very attractive house.  But hoarding is often triggered by traumatic le events and the problems in Paulaposs home began after the said death of his mum, Liverpool Echo reports.He said: Four and a half years after my mother died, in , thataposs when I started collecting. I think in the back of my mind, I thought aposthat will look nice in the houseapos a bit like what my mother had. And then it began to overwhelm me over time and got too much. The books are the first thing that started to pile up and Iaposve got a couple thousands books now. During the programme, George Mensah of Merseyside House Clearance was called in to clear Paulaposs home.  Unable to even enter the property, George was forced to climb over the mounds of belongings that Paul had accumulated and even used a special camera to be able to see further into the home. During his survey, the master cleaner found rats that had become trapped in the house and then died, being left to rot and stfen amongst the rubbish. Some of the most commonly hoarded items, such as papers, books and clothing, were all found in the rooms of the house as George made his way through. This had filled up every room in Paulaposs house, including the hallway, but some other items that Paul had collected were slightly more unusual. Roman artefacts, weapons and armour were also discovered during the clear out. One bedroom was the only area of the house that George could properly access. Paul hoped that cleaners could sht his hoard for him and he would be able to sell the home, which lies on a quiet street in Sefton, to fund his retirement. During the clean up process, Paul found it dficult to let some of his items go and could be heard telling Georgeaposs colleagues not to throw books away and saying he wanted to keep a part of the Roman wall in York.  After some of the hoard was cleared, Paul was informed that due to the damage he had caused to his home by the hoarding, it would only be worth £, on the market. It took eight skips and nine days in total to clear Paulaposs house before potential buyers were able to come and view the property. Hoarding disorder is the mental health problem that has led people to leave their homes in filthy conditions, piled high with rubbish and has even led to a number of court cases over the years. The Royal College of Psychiatrists and the NHS have signicant information about hoarding disorder and what it can mean for people day-to-day but also explains that hoarding can lead to signicant problems, such as those above. Here are some of the most common questions about hoarding disorder, what it means, and how to stop it getting out of control. What is hoarding disorder  Hoarding disorder is where someone acquires an excessive number of items and stores them in a chaotic manner. This usually results in unmanageable amounts of clutter and in some cases hoarding in your home. Most common items that people hoard Some people with a hoarding disorder will hoard a range of items, while others may just hoard certain types of objects. Items that are often hoarded include newspapers and magazines, books, clothes, receipts and household supplies. Some people also hoard animals, which they may not be able to look after properly. More recently, hoarding of data has become more common. This is where someone stores huge amounts of electronic data and emails that theyaposre extremely reluctant to delete. Why do people hoard  The reasons why someone begins hoarding are not fully understood but it can often be a symptom of another condition. Mental health problems associated with hoarding include severe depression, psychotic disorders and obsessive compulsive disorder. In some cases, hoarding is a condition in itself and often associated with self-neglect. These people are more likely to live alone, be unmarried, have had a deprived childhood or have a family history of hoarding. How can hoarders be treated  Hoarding disorders are challenging to treat because many people who hoard frequently do not see it as a problem, or have little awareness of how itaposs affecting their le or the lives of others. Many do realise they have a problem but are reluctant to seek help because they feel extremely ashamed, humiliated or guilty about it. Itaposs really important to encourage a person who is hoarding to seek help, as their dficulties discarding objects can not only cause loneliness and mental health problems but also pose a health and safety risk. Hoarding makes it dficult for a person to move around their home, and it can also cause their work performance, personal hygiene and relationships to suffer as it takes over their le. So much clutter in a home can be dangerous and unhygienic. It can lead to rodent or insect infestations, be a fire risk and block exits in the event of an emergency, cause trips and falls, or even collapse on peoplekept in tall piles. To help a person with a suspected hoarding disorder, try to persuade them to go with you to see a GP, the NHS says. It adds: This may not be easy, as someone who hoards might not think they need help. Try to be sensitive about the issue and emphasise your concerns for their health and wellbeing. Reassure them that nobody is going to go into their home and throw everything out. Youaposre just going to have a chat with the doctor about their hoarding to see what can be done and what support is available to empower them to begin the process of decluttering. The main treatment is cognitive behavioural therapywith a therapist who will help the person to understand why they are unable to bin things and allow clutter to build up. Antidepressant medicines called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have also been shown to help some people with hoarding disorders, the NHS says."},{"url":null,"title":"lucky dad wins lottery after","story":"AdvertorialLucky dad wins Lottery after le-saving operation - and his reaction is brilliantThrilled Graham was overjoyed to scoop a share of £, playing Peoples Postcode LotteryShareByDave Masters:,  AUG AdvertorialThrilled Graham Forrester has gone from le-saving surgery to a le-changing fortune after winning a share of £, on People’s Postcode Lottery.

A survey of , adults found  per cent had seen someone screaming or shouting at another member of public in a retail store. Racist, sexist or homophobic abuse has been witnessed by  per cent while out shopping or walking. And one in  people had seen someone scream or shout at a member of staff in hospital. Two thirds now think the levels of disrespect in the UK have reached an unacceptable level - with  per cent feeling the problem has got worse in the last two years. But, while Brits say society is getting worse in terms of the abuse they see, three quarters has admitted dishing it out THEMSELVES. As many as  per cent of those polled said theyaposve disrespected someone in the past week alone, according to Nationwide Building Society. Of those whoaposve looked back on a moment and realised they had disrespected someone, more than halfsaid they were disappointed with themselves. While  per cent felt ashamed and  per cent said they were determined to do better in the future. The study also found emergency service workers topped a list of people who were not as valued as they should be in society. They were followed by teachers and education support staff, those who work on public transport, members of the armed forces and waiting staff. The survey also revealed how apostoxicapos the public think social media has become. More than three quarters think abuse online has reached unacceptable levels - with  per cent leaving social media due to abuse they or someone they know has suffered.  However, almost two thirds of adults feel they have become more respectful with age - but seven per cent admit to becoming less respectful. The research was carried out by Nationwide Building Society after it launched a three-year partnership to support The Football Associationaposs Respect campaign. The grassroots football initiative aims to reinforce the importance of mutual respect on and off the pitch. As part of the campaign, the FA will be advising parents and coaches on their roles in creating a fun, safe and inclusive environment for everyone.  Sara Bennison, Nationwide chief marketing officer, said:  has not been the year any of us expected - so much distress.But we have also had a sharp reminder of how dependent on each other we all are.Fostering greater mutual respect becomes more important than ever.The FA have demonstrated their commitment to this at a grassroots level and we are delighted to be able to help them expand their Respect programme. It is hoped the initiative will ensure a positive and enjoyable football environment for young people by promoting respect between players, coaches, referees and spectators. The campaign is looking to involve one million players, parents and coaches in The FA Respect programme over the next three years. James Kendall, director of football development at The FA, added: Over the years The FAaposs Respect campaign has championed the importance of mutual respect on and off the football pitch, most particularly amongst young people. We have worked hard to provide players with the guidance and confidence to act in this way the same is true for parents, referees and the communities they play within. It is so good then that we can work with partners such as Nationwide who understand the positive impact football can have on society and share our determination to improve the game. As we restart the grassroots game it is important to take the opportunity to reaffirm the values that are crucial for the wellbeing of football - respect and anti-discrimination are core to that.

Kenyon claimed the tribute at Regina Court in Salford, Greater Manchester was a health and safety hazard and was said to have uprooted the ft high tree, killed off the grass and plants with weedkiller and even damaged the ornaments which included commemorative dolls. He was also accused of writing poison pen notes claiming Mrs Ilkovics had a bogus husband and that she had only married him for his money and suggested she was involved in shoplting.Kenyon would rant and rave at her from behind a window at his flat and unnecessarily summoning ambulances to Mrs Ilkovicsapos home wrongly claiming she had a severe mental illness and needed taking away. During one incident Kenyon dumped some of the ornaments in a shoebox on Mrs Ilkovicaposs wheelie bin whilst she was away on holiday with an acerbic note saying: Please find enclosed the funeral ornaments you placed without permission.Said items Iaposm reliably informed are supposed to be placed indoors either side of an urn for example. Whilst one appreciates certain iniduals placing such items and all manner of other rubbish on graves, It is not acceptable in a domestic garden.You have caused not only an affront to my religious beliefs but blocked access to the fire escape and wasted police time.  Another note he put in his window referred to Mrs Ilkovicaposs home saying: Goods available strictly CODconvicted shoplter. At Manchester magistrates court this week the so-called Battle of Regina Court came to a climax with Kenyon being convicted of harassment between September  and February . He was cleared of assaulting Mrs Ilkovics by throwing a dog toy at her. He denied any wrongdoing. The court heard Mrs Ilkovics had married her husband in June  as he lay terminally ill in hospital and he died the following month.  But she fell out with Kenyon when set up the shrine outside their respective homes in the apartment complex which houses the elderly or those with disabilities. Mrs Ilkovics told JPs: Before Rick got ill we planted a little pussy willow in  and after his death I put a few things that were a tribute to him - plastic hearts, flowers and such like. The little heart had apossadly missedapos on it and there was a little angel and a little heart with flowers that my friend gave me to put there. It was something to put there in honour of my late husband - it wasnapost a great big tribute it was just three little ornaments.  When Mr Kenyon originally moved into his flat I had personally asked him does he mindI worked on the garden and put things in it and his answer was: aposyou can do anything you want with it - Iaposm not into gardening.apos I like a nice garden it is therapeutic for me. But the first thing was I received was note in the box I had made which was saying I only married Rick for his money and that he was a aposbogusapos husband. My sister had invited me over to Portugal for a week but when It got back, a neighbour was at the door waiting for me she said: aposthey are on the bin and I saw a note about the ornaments. I felt very upset as it was about my husband and my husband was my le. What Mr Kenyon was saying about the ornaments was horrible. How can an ornament cause a fire hazard  I reported it to the housing association but I received three more notes saying hateful and nasty things about me having second and third hand stuff in the garden - that I was this, that and the other.  One was pinned to the dolls outside my front door. I had bought some slates as I thought the turf was dying but it was due to weed killer. I had seen him spraying weed killer on the garden on a number of occasions - why should he use weed killer on the garden knowing it would kill my plants that I took pride in  It has affected me a lot. I have depression and anxiety and at one stage I wanted to kill myself. I couldnapost live with the pain of what he was doing to what once was mine and my husbandaposs pride and joy. It hurt a lot losing my husband and it still hurts now. It then really hurts when I look at what this man has done outside my front door. He could have knocked on my door instead of ripping them up and putting them in a black shoe box on top of my bin.  Itaposs disgusting and horrible to have to live with. I lie awake all night thinking he is going to do something and most of the time Iaposm right. He went berserk on everything and he couldnapost have a conversation with you. He would just shout things like aposcan you get rid of those things apos I was told to remove the dolls from the front door they said it was blocking a fire exit. They had been screwed down but they got broken into pieces by Mr Kenyon. There was one left near my bin shed with all horrible stuff tipped on it. On one occasion my friendaposs daughter paid for me to go to Costa Del Sol to get a break. I had not long been back home when I got a knock on my door at am and there was loads of banging outside.  I knew it would be something to do with Anthony Kenyon. I soon found everything smashed up and pulled up again - the trellis with the roses, the rose bush, the trellis around the garden. The fencing all smashed up. The pussy willow had been twisted asit had tried to drag it out and I nearly fainted. I was anxious and upset because that was the last thing that I could remember my husband by. Mr Kenyon was was talking through the window, ranting and raving about my roses on the ground being at his doorstep and using terrible language. I donapost know what he was talking about. He was mentioning Rickaposs name all the time and calling him names. He didnapost even know Rick who was a wonderful man. I have become a hermit in my own home I donapost feel asmy own home is my home anymore. But I wonapost leave as it has got my memories of my husband.

Lissie Harper admits she felt let down by jurors and wants those who take a le - like those who stole Andrew from her just just four weeks after their wedding day - to pay the price. “I’m not sure what happened to Andrew will ever sink in,” Lissie says. “It’s not really something that’s easy to come to terms with. Everything in my le is dferent now. “Yet it could be  years or less and those who did this to us could be out on the streets living the same sort of criminal lestyle. Whereas Andrew’s le has been robbed from him. It’s not right. And it’s despicable to think that is just how things are and we’ve accepted that for so long. “It’s time to change that.” PC Harper was killed when teenage thugs dragged him with their speeding car for more than a mile. He was left with such “catastrophic injuries”, that one witness mistook his body for that of an injured deer. Devastated we Lissie, , was then dealt a further heartwrenching blow when the three teens responsible - Driver Henry Long, , and Jessie Cole and Albert Bowers, both  - were cleared of murder and sentenced for the lesser charge of manslaughter instead - meaning they could be back on the streets in as little as seven and eight years with time off for good behaviour. Now, after enduring what would have been her first wedding anniversary and the first anniversary of his death, Lissie wants to right these wrongs for her beloved Andrew. And ahead of meeting with Home Secretary Priti Patel next month, she’s asking Mirror readers to help back her petition for Harper’s Law, which will see anyone committing a crime which leads to the death of an emergency services worker get an automatic le sentence. Askedshe was angry towards the jurors , Lissie laments: “I feel very let down.  “Somehow they didn’t see what the whole rest of the country could see. “But I’m putting all my energy into Harper’s Law so that it doesn’t happen again, to someone .” Under her proposed lawany emergency services worker is killed as a direct consequence of crime, the offender should automatically spend the rest of their le in jail. This meansa firefighter is killed in an arson, the arsonist would face the ultimate sentence. Some may argue it’s a knee-jerk call for American-style “eye for an eye”, “string them up” justice. But Lissie, backed by the Police Federation of England and Wales, stresses it’s about valuing those who put their lives on the line every day.  “When it comes to justice, America’s a whole dferent kind of world. And that’s the reason we doing Harper’s Law - to balance out what’s right and what should be,” she explains. “The death sentence is a very, very dferent thing altogether and that’s not what this is about but obviously I want there to be much tougher convictions. “If you take someone’s le, that’s it - pure and simple - you should pay for that. If you’re committing a crime and as a result of that crime someone is killed I think you deserve to spend the rest of your le in prison.” She adds that her husband would be right behind her: “I know that he would be very supportive of Harper’s Law” Supportive is not all he’d be. “He’d also be surprised,” Lissie admits.  “All this is not something I’d done before.” That’s an understatement. Lissie was once so timid about public speaking, she had a friend read out her wedding speech. Now she’s speaks with great dignity. She knows her campaign inside out, she shares stories of how content and happy she and Andrew were, and is an open book when it comes to the dficulty she’s had coping with the grief. What happened on that fateful night of August  last year caused national outrage.  The childhood sweethearts, who had dated since they were  and grew up in each others’ pockets, had celebrated their fairytale wedding at Oxfordshire’s Ardington House on July . They had their compact-but-homely one-bed cottage on the banks of the Thames in Wallingford, South Oxfordshire, a stone’s throw from their families. And they were planning to start a family of their own after a belated honeymoon to the Males, planned for just a few days later. But with one  call that all disappeared. Committed Thames Valley police officer PC Harper was four hours into overtime. At pm he rang Lissie to say he loved her and talk about her planned new design business.  Then just before he was due to sign off, a call came in about a stolen quad bike in Stanford Dingley, Berkshire. As PC Harper tried to stop the thieves they sped off in their Seat Toledo, while his feet were caught in a tow rope hanging out of its car boot. His fatal injuries left him so unrecognisible, Lissie was warned not to go to the morgue. Her heartache was only compounded at trial when Long, Cole and Bowers, petty criminals from a travellers’ community in nearby Reading were found not guilty of murder. Instead Long pleaded guilty to manslaughter and was sentenced to  years while the others were found guilty of the same charge and sentenced to  years each. With good behaviour they could all be out in half that time.  “It wasn’t what I expected” says Lissie. “I just felt disappointed for Andrew. That’s all I could think about. How could these people take so much le and that’s what they’re faced with  It’s just not right. It’s outrageous.” Lissie already has , signatures on her Harper’s Law petition with Change.org. Petitions have to be discussed by parliamentthey reach ,. But Lissie wants more to ensure her upcoming crunch meeting with Priti Patel goes well. She says: “I would really appreciate the Mirror‘s loyal readers adding their voice to my vital campaign by signing my petition. And together we will achieve Harper’s Law.” Police alone face , physical attacks a year.  And there’s a certain irony, that one of Andrew’s only bugbears about his dream job was the soft justice his collars sometime got. “Andrew loved his job,” she says. “But police spend a lot of time out on the streets, trying to arrest people and get the right type of justice, only for them not get the sentence that they should.” Andrew’s family are backing Lissie all the way. She’s still and always will be, part of the family. But Lissie’s also under no illusion Harper’s Law is one of the only things helping her get out of bed in the mornings. She spent nine months living with her parents after Andrew’s death and only ed to their cottage in May. Andrew and her had planned to be hearing the little pitter patter of tiny feet by now.  Instead she woke on their wedding anniversary in July to see his toothbrush still in its holder, his clothes still in the wardrobe, but only his ashes in a wooden box for company. As for a baby, well, that’s now her campaign. That poignant date was obviously horrendous. “Oh yeah,” she says slowly. “I went for a walk and I got him some flowers and just remembered the happy memories we had from our wedding day. But, yeah it was hard.” Has she brought herself to watch the wedding video yet  “No, no, not yet. I think I will one day, but no I just can’t,” she says. Nor can she get rid of any of his belongings. Or picture moving out of the cottage. And whether she could one day marry again is not even a seed of a thought.  The anniversary of his death was just as tough. “It was the same pain as every other day, just more signicant,” she says. “I did all I could do - had a quiet day remembering him. I still can’t believe it’s been a year.” Does she still think about the what s  “A little bit,” she admits. “He told me once ‘Death is just another adventure’. There’s definitely comfort in that.” Lissie has had some positive news recently in that the offenders’ sentences are to be reviewed by the Attorney General who felt they are too lenient.

In fact, the Cambridge family have two stunning royal properties - one in London and another in Norfolk. Their main base is Apartment A of Kensington Palace, near Prince George and Princess Charlotteaposs school, which boasts  rooms, including five reception rooms, three master bedrooms and two nurseries. It also has two kitchens, which earned the Duchess the nickname two-kitchens Kate after the couple spent £.million of taxpayersapos money refurbishing the property when they moved in. Speaking about the Cambridge family home on True Royaltyaposs Royal Beat, royal author Christopher Warwick said: It has  rooms from the basement to the attic, it is not a small house. All of these royal residences at Kensington Palace are called apartments, which of course makes people immediately think they are flats like the American term for an apartment. They are not. If you think of Kensington Place in a way it is built around three courtyards. If you kind of think of them as being these wonderful red brick terrace houses. Because they are all joined, but separate houses. Royal editor Ingrid Seward added: Itaposs enormous - and itaposs like a piece of countryside in London.  The Cambridges arenapost the only royals to live at the palace, and Princess Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank, Prince Richard, the Queenaposs cousin and his we and the Prince and Princess of Kent also call it home. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry also used to live there, in Nottingham Cottage, before moving to Windsor, and then Canada and LA.While parts of Kensington Palace are open to the public, the familyaposs private living area isnapost - and they are given completely privacy there. However Kate and William occasionally use it as a base when hosting guests - which means weaposve have a sneak peek inside some of the more formal parts. When Barack and Michelle Obama visited the UK back in , Kate and William invited them into their apartment for dinner. Later that year the Duchess set up a aposnews roomapos in the Palace to use on the day she guest edited the Huffington Post UK for a day as part of the Young Minds Matter initiative.During the coronavirus pandemic, the couple have been working from home like everyone  - and theyaposve shown us some snaps of their offices.Kate has a line of Penguinaposs Clothbook Classics, novels released in hardback with beautully illustrated covers. Her collection includes Jane Austinaposs Manfield Park and Northanger Abbey and George Elliottaposs Middlemarch. Buying all the books separately would set you back £, but theyaposre currently on offer for £ for all . Kateaposs wooden chair has a creamed stripped cushion. In the background there is a white sofa, and what looks like a childrenaposs armchair which may belong to George, Charlotte and Louis. William also shared a snap of his home set up, which appears to be in a dferent room, with a traditional wooden desk in front of a large fireplace.

Dubbed the first of its kind in the western hemisphere, Port Lympne Hotel  Reserve near Hythe, Kent has spent nearly two years preparing to open its Giraffe Hall for animal lovers. Located inside a th century Grade II listed Wealden hall house, the hotel boasts  en-suite bedrooms, and an additional five luxury cabins - which will provide  mile unrivalled views over the reserve. Giraffe Hall is at the top of the reserve, overlooking The African Experience, meaning guests will be closer than ever to animals commonly only seen in the wild. A statement from Port Lympne says: Once completed, the hotel will offer a luxury safari feel while incorporating the comforts and décor of an English stately home. Guests will be able to feed the giraffes from their bedroom windows, while thereaposs also going to be a cabana style retreat for visitors to sit and enjoy a drink and take in the views. The surrounding gardens are also being tended to, where a route for giraffes is being made. Families will be able to get a good nightaposs rest and be woken up by the beautul giraffes whose long walking trail will be directed right past the building. A total of  guests can stay at the hotel at any one time. Itaposs expected the luxury hotel will open next summer. Port Lympne says the interiors will be designed by Victoria Aspinall and that many of the buildingaposs original outstanding features will be retained. The house will convert the already on-site restaurant to include an outdoor decking and offer breakfast, lunch and dinner. According to reports, the waiting list to stay at the hotel has more than , people on it.The animals have already been introduced to their wider habitat, and many of them are already walking past the under construction property, Kent Live reported last September. Port Lympne has previously spoken about its plans to make Giraffe Hall a sought after venue for wedding and private parties. No price package has yet been published due to the incompletion of the animal experience.  Port Lympne already offers a number of animal experiences, including Lion Lodge, Rhino Lodge and Tiger Lodge. Guests staying at Lion Lodge sleep just metres away from the lions - Adras, Oudrika and their three cubs - and right in the centre of their natural and spacious habitat. The lodge includes picture windows in both the master bedroom and the open plan living area, meaning guests will be just a whisker away from lions.

Jenny Edgar, , would gagshe tried anything other than her bland diet of dry cereal, cheese and biscuits and her everyday dinner of pasta or chips.Even her Christmas dinner was macaroni cheese washed down with a glass of water.The health centre receptionist, from Coventry, avoided eating out as any fruit, vegetables or fish would leave her heaving. As a result of her limited diet, the mum-of-one piled on the pounds and now tips the scales at st lbs. But after getting engaged she decided to face her le-long fear of healthy grub to lose weight before getting married next March. Incredibly, after six hypnotherapy sessions, Jenny can now tuck into some of her most feared foods. She said: When I was a child I would eat raisins and grapes but hated vegetables. As I got older I didnapost touch greens at all and would just eat cheese and pasta because I knew I liked them.  I had a real fear of not liking fruit and veg so didnapost even bother putting them in my mouth in case I had to spit them out. I really hated the texture on some fruits like the fuzz on peaches or the juiciness of tomatoes so just didnapost eat them. When I was in my teens it wasnapost really a problem because I was quite slim but after going to college and having my son I really noticed the weight going on. I also stopped meeting friends in restaurants or going out in case I didnapost like the food.  One Sunday I went for dinner at my fianceaposs house and I had to take my own ready meal of macaroni cheese. It was very embarrassing and it was getting me down. I just thought to myself thatI donapost sort it out now then I never will. Jenny, who lives with partner Mark Lancashire, , who works in data-input, decided to tackle her fears to help her eight-year-old son Kian have a healthy diet. She added: Kian is of an age where he needs to try dferent foods and I didnapost want him to be affected by me. Because I donapost like fruit and veg Iaposve only been buying him strawberries but I want him to try lots of dferent things.  Jenny visited hypnotherapist Russell Hemmings who coached her, using cognitive behavioral therapy and hypnotherapy, to overcome her phobia. She said: The first session I had was amazing. He just talked to me in a really relaxed way and got me to try five dferent fruits. I put a piece of pineapple in my mouth and just couldnapost believe the flavour. It was delicious and I said I couldnapost believe Iaposd waited so long to eat it. I also had mango and apple although Iaposm not as keen on apples but at least Iaposm giving them a try. After a few more sessions, Russell cooked up fresh fish and vegetables which tasted great. I was worried to try them at first but then after a few nibbles I was hooked. Now Jenny is looking forward to expanding her cooking skills and is even planning on growing her own veg at home. Self-help guru and author Russell Hemmings who specialises in treating anxiety disorders, depression and weight, said: Eating anxiety is often deep seated in childhood and certain foods can trigger emotions and negative responses. When working with food aversion, the phobic response when food is introduced may also induce a feeling of revulsion. Food aversion can grow very strong, and can also unfortunately last a le-time. Usually food textures have been limited or not experienced whilst growing up as the fussy eater limits their choice foods so a fresh tomato for instance can be overwhelming. Trying to cope with the seeds, flesh, juice and skin can be simply too much for a fussy eater to handle. By using a three-pronged approach of coaching, hypnotherapy cognitive behavioural therapy , I was able to re-wire Jennyaposs responses so she no longer feared certain foods.

Now, he has built up an extensive fan base on TikTok for posting regular videos going about his daily le with his incredibly long digit. Whilst a number of people were quick to say it was fake and the videos he had posted had been edited, Jacob was quick to set the record straight.Speaking to Buzzfeed, Jacob confirmed that his expendable thumb is real.He explained: I just dislocate my thumb, by forcing it out of its socket, to make it appear longer.  My doctor says itaposs abnormal but canapost officially link it to any known medical conditions. Since he already has long fingers, he said itaposs hard to notice the freakish nature of his thumb until he dislocates it, which is supposedly painless. Jacob admits that he never expected for his thumb to receive so much recognition, winning him over one million followers.  He said: When I posted my first video to TikTok, I had no clue Iaposd get this sort of attention from it. People have mixed reactions, like disgusted, freaked out, or curious.  When Jacob reacted to a fanaposs comment which read: How is this guy mutating his thumb and scientists are not taking his DNA  TikTok users were extremely freaked out by the sound of the bones in his thumb cracking.

Four of the family were placed in medically-induced comas after a blast at their holiday home in Torres Vedras, Portugal, left them fighting for their lives. Mafalda Da Silva Baptista, , from Switzerland, has described how her aposheroapos brother, then aged nine, ran back into the property to rescue her on April , . Pedro Baptista, , Fatima Da Silva, , Diogo Da Silva Baptista,  and Tozé Da Silva, , all suffered first to third-degree burns.  The horror fire happened after a hot water tap in the home exploded when her dad Pedro switched it on. Mafalda, then seven, woke up to a fire surrounding her room and feared for her le as she was too scared to run through the flames. Realising she was still in the house, Mafalda’s brother, Diogo, who was nine-years-old at the time, rushed in to to save her, They then fled to their neighbour’s home as Mafalda saw her father jump out of the kitchen window. Her dad was engulfed in flames after his clothes caught fire.  Mafalda and her cousin took a cold shower at a neighbour’s house and recalled trembling and feeling her skin tighten up.  The whole family, apart from Diogo, were placed in medically-induced comas, with doctors giving them a  per cent chance to survive. Tozé, who lost half his ear and several fingers on his right hand, stayed in a coma for a month, while the rest of the family woke up after two weeks.  Speaking about the terrying moment, Mafalda said: “I went on vacation to Portugal with my father, brother, aunt, and my cousin. “We had a newly built house while my mother stayed in Switzerland to work. “In the morning I was with my brother in bed sleeping when our house exploded. “It happened when my father wanted to turn on the warm water.  “I woke up from the heat and saw fire everywhere, I was standing like a statue and I didnapost dare to run through the fire. “My brother was my hero. He came back into the house because he noticed that I was still inside. He came in and took my hand and we ran out to the neighbours together. “My aunt and my cousin were already in front of the door. “I looked around to see my father and saw him jumping out of the kitchen window, his whole body and clothes were burning. “We ran to one neighbour and my father to the other.  “I just realised how serious the situation was when I was under the cold shower with my two-year-old cousin. “I started to tremble and my skin began to pull together. At that moment we all felt no pain because the fear was greater than the pain and the fear of death.” Mafalda remained at the hospital for more than a year and spent two months at a rehabilitation clinic to gain her mobility back. She had dficulty accepting her new appearance and was ridiculed and bullied by her peers at school.  The teenager said: “After the accident, it was dficult because I stayed in the hospital for a very long time and my le had completely changed. “I looked very dferent, and couldnapost care less about myself and didnapost love myself. “I was in the hospital for a year and when I came back to school, I was heavily bullied. “I was told things like ‘ugly burned chicken’ and ‘here comes the burned cowapos.”  Over the years, Mafalda has learned to love herself from within and is grateful for all the struggles she has faced in her le saying it has shaped her into the person she is today. She said: “Today I am so thankful for everything! I am immensely grateful for all the dficulties I had in my le, because I think back and know how strong I was and that I always fought. “I love myself very tightly and nobody can take that away from me. “This accident was a blessing for me.  “I was allowed to see and learn a lot and I am very grateful for every problem and every pain. My past defines the woman that I am today.” Mafalda hopes to become a model and is proud of her scars, seeing the beauty in her skin as a symbol of her strength. She added: “I want to show the world that everything can be achieved in le! “I would like to become a photo model, evenmany people doubt my dream, but I believe in myself.

Not for partisan reasons but because there’s so many areas where Labour has to be there to make sure that we deal with those issues of disadvantage, particularly some of the educational developments we’ve seen over recent years.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

I’ve spoken to the players about that.‘We know we are not going to win the competition, but we can get to the group stages.“For me, it would feel like a financial win and a win all around. Hopefully we can be that team.”Aberdeen have failed to progress beyond the third qualying round stage in six successive seasons under McInnes.He hopes it will be seventh time lucky in a season in which qualying rounds have been reduced to one leg by Uefa.McInnes is aware the all-or-nothing stature of a single leg makes it more precarious.He said: “If you are the underdog for one game you are underdogs for two games, usually.“With the one-off ties there are fewer minutes to play so for that reason any team who aren’t favourites will have a better chance of going through.‘Whether we are favourites or underdogs, we understand that we have to bring a level of performance that we are happy with.“We’ll give our opponent every respect. Regardless of these early rounds, we’ve always tried to respect our opponent. Any team that beats their opponent - deserves that respect.”Runavik made club history last week by progressing in a European round for the first time.In defeating Barry Town United - in the Faroe Islands, it was the first time in  attempts they had progressed to the next round.In  European matches at preliminary or first qualying round level NSI Runavik have won just three, lost  and drawn two. In , they lost - on aggregate to Hibernian.McInnes said: “I think there is an automatic feeling thatyou have not heard of a team you should be beating them.“Dferent nations are stronger than others, butyou start to look a bit deeper into any opponent you can see there is a calibre of player and performance within each and every team. Runavik are no dferent.“It’s a one-off game. I’ve always felt that ordinarily you need to bring two decent-level performances to get through a tie.“The nature of the competition now means we just need a strong  minutes and hopefully get the job done.”Aberdeen could not send anyone to the Faroe Islands to watch NSI Runavik’s preliminary round due to Covid- travel guidance.McInnes has studied footage of the game, albeit the match was shrouded in heavy fog.Faroe Islands international striker Klaemint Olsen scored a hat-trick. Olsen has scored more than  goals for Runavik.McInnes said: “They’re a very good possession-based team who have good experience and a talismanic striker in Olsen.“We’ve got to make sure we’re good at our own game and bring a level of performance.”Aberdeen have suffered a troubled start to the season with three postponements following coronavirus protocol breaches.The postponements have restricted the Dons to just three Premiership games this season, while, in contrast, Runavik are  games into their league.McInnes said: “We expect a tough match. Their biggest advantage over us is that this is their th game of their season, which started in May.“The benefit of them playing games is that we’ve got to see plenty of them in action. We feel we have a good handle of them.”Aberdeen will hand a late fitness test to Niall McGinn on an ankle injury. Scott McKenna is fit, having been substituted at half-time against Livingston.Funso Ojo is suspended following his red card last season in the - home loss to HNK Rijeka.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

The village#s fire engine was used to demonstrate to the youngsters how dficult they are to see from the cab of a large goods vehicle, particularly to the rear and near side at junctions.They also learned about primary and secondary road positions, right of way and good observational skills.They were even encouraged to ask their parentsthey do the #Dutch Reach# to keep passing cyclists safe.

Instead of using the hand closest to the door, it means reaching across to open the door with the hand furthest from the door # your left handyou are the driver. This naturally turns your body towards the window, helping you spot approaching cyclists.Mr Catterwell added: #Thanks to Scottish Fire and Rescue Service for the use of the appliance and the drill yard, the Bike Bothy for administrative assistance and training materials and Graham Love for his excellent mechanical services. Also to residents and holiday makers around Craignish who were mostly respectful of the learner cyclists.#P S pupils Fergus Bennett, Beth Gregory, Magnus Hampton, Kay Neville, Harry Whittle and Reiley Van Der Zel received their Bikeability  badges.

There are information signs from Balloch to Tarbet advising of the closure at the Rest.Surely moving the signs to Ardgartan would make more sense. Should anyone have to turn then there is ample space to do this. We cannot continue to render two villages effectively closed in case someone has failed to read the signs or cannot turn.Transport Scotland and BEAR Scotland must guarantee that the signs will not be put back in the same place when further disruption occurs, and it will.Jane Ireland, Slanj restaurant, Tarbet"},{"url":null,"title":"news from the districts august 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMull of Kintyre music festivalhas taken its virtual  event to new heights by beaming a unique Scottish rendition of David Bowie’s #Space Oddity# to the International Space Station.The annual music festival teamed up with the Machrihanish Airbase Community Company , in the running to become the UK’s first spaceport, to record the unique set, featuring local band Slainte Davaar Allstar’s cover of Bowie’s iconic track.With the festival moved online this year the organisers came up with the idea of partnering with the local base and its unconventional location for the exclusive gig.The set was performed on the former top-secret RAF base runway # nearly two miles long and one of the longest in Europe – for current Commander of the ISS Chris Cassidy and Cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner, as they orbit the earth at ,mph.Event manager Iain Johnston of JIG Events said: #The Mull of Kintyre Music Festival has encouraged people to visit Kintyre from all parts of the globe since its inception  years ago and we were naturally disappointed, like every other event organiser up and down the country, to have to cancel this year.

Control system builders ITI will undertake the design, installation and commissioning of the upgrade across the station’s four units.The power station, constructed in a cavern within Ben Cruachan on the shores of Loch Awe, plays a critical role in stabilising the country’s electricity system throughout the Covid- pandemic due to its flexibility. The plant can generate power in less than a minute when needed and can also store excess electricity from the grid like a giant battery, a service which was called upon when the low electricity demand during the lockdown coincided with periods of high wind power in Scotland.The plant’s reversible turbines pump water from Loch Awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid. The stored water is then released back through the turbines to generate power quickly and reliably when demand increases."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 21 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGordon Stewart from Ardfern sent us thisatmospheric photograph, taken from Corranmor Farm on Monday August .A stunning full rainbow appeared that day over Loch Craignish lagoon, captured by Gordon on camera.PIC:no_aYourPictures_Rainbow"},{"url":null,"title":"enjoy cowal highland gathering in the comfort of your own home","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWith just days to go until one of Scotland’s favourite events takes the virtual stage for the first time, Cowal Highland Gathering’s organisers are preparing to unveil a packed programme to a worldwide audience.Cowal’s Virtual Highland Gathering is an ambitious three-day event which mirrors as closely as possible the programme of the gathering itself.Kicking off on Thursday August , Cowal’s Virtual Gathering features a host of exclusive interviews and performances, together with a look back at some of the highlights of the -year-old event.The Gathering’s Friday night gig is back too, with the Gig at the Gathering Unplugged going live from pm.

The early signs are encouraging but we must see swt progress maintained until the new route is fully operational.#Following the meeting of the taskforce, Mr Matheson said: #I understand the frustration and disruption that landslips at the A Rest and Be Thankful bring for local communities and drivers.#While our previous investment in catch pits has helped keep the road open for an estimated  days when it would otherwise have closed, I realise people are looking for a long-term solution to dealing with landslips at the site.#I have instructed officials at Transport Scotland to accelerate our work to consider alternative infrastructure options for the A. A dedicated team will be established to do a more detailed assessment, in parallel with the Strategic Transport Projects Review. Stakeholders will be involved in this process and we will publish recommendations for a preferred corridor in spring .#In the meantime, work will continue on the next catch pit and we will continue to consider further catch pits at the site. A new geotechnical survey of the hillside will also be carried out to build on the previous work that has been done.#This work underlines the Scottish Government’s commitment to continued work with key stakeholders to ensure that Argyll and Bute remains open for business.#Work will begin on the next phase of catch pits in September.

and those around us.However, people wearing face coverings every day have been noticing that they have started to break out in acne, rashes and skin irritations.Have you had more breakouts since you started wearing a mask We have spoken to Dermalogica skin care expert and beautician Ashley Richards to find out why this happens and how you can protect your skin.What is ldquomaskne Maskne occurs when sweat, oil and bacteria are trapped on your skin while wearing a mask, creating the perfect breeding ground for breakouts.What causes it Maskne is caused by friction, rubbing, and occlusion of the skin by outside forces.Wearing a mask can trap dirt, oil, swear and humidity around the skin.Friction and irritation from the mask pushes bacteria into the skin, which creates micro-tears, and allows the bacteria and dirt to enter the skin more easily.This will lead to blackheads and whiteheads along the bridge of your nose, cheeks and chin. Masks can trigger ious types of skin irritationsand redness .How can you combat maskne There isnrsquot a prevention for maskne, as we need to continue wearing our masks, but there are ways that you can help combat the issues.Skin Care routineIf you want to combat the impact of maskne then having a good skincare routine is essential.It is just as important to cleanse your skin before wearing a mask as it is to cleanse after wearing a mask.To help your skin heal, Ashley would recommend using a squalane or balm cleanser so help remove make-up, dirt and debris.However,you are experiencing chapped, irritated skin or suffer from sensitivity then a gel based cleanseradvised.Dermalogicarsquos UltraCalming Cleanser helps to calm and cool sensitised irritated skin.ExfoliatingExfoliating is key to clear clogged pores and remove dead skin cells which will help reduce the impact of maskne.There are thousands of dferent types of exfoliators available from chemical, physical and masks but it is always important to follow the recommended application and how often you should use the product.Over-exfoliating your skin can compromise your skins barrier , damage the skins capillaries and dehydrate the skin.Ingredients such as glycolic acid, lactic acid and salicylic acid are great exfoliating athelping fight breakouts.Spot treatmentsUsing targeted spot treatments with ingredients such as salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide will help remove dead skin cells and decongest pores.Hyaluronic AcidsHyaluronic acid can hold , times its weight in water - so it is like a magnet for moisture.,params: .pushUsing hyaluronic acid regularly will leave the skin feeling super-soft, radiant and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.Hyaluronic acid has antibacterial properties meaning it will help soothe and protect chapped, irritated skin.FoundationsOpt for tinted moisturisers rather than a heavy foundation or go bare faced to help cause less clogging in your pores - but donrsquot forget your SPF!MoisturisersHeavier moisturisers will sit on the skin for longer due to the humidity of wearing the mask which can cause further clogging and irritation of the skin.However, donrsquot want to stop using a moisturiser all together as our skin still requires hydration and moisture.Instead try using a light and soothing moisturise such as Charlotte Tilburyrsquos Magic Cream light.Chapped SkinFor those suffering from chapped skin try using a physical barrier cream such as Dermalogicarsquos Barrier Repair.Barrier Repair shields against environmental pollution and helps forty sensitive skin with a damaged barrier."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-mobile-testing-unit-hawick---know","story":"A MOBILE-TESTING unitwill run in Hawick for six days, according to NHS Borders.It comes following an outbreak in the townlinked to three businesses.The testing unit will operate from tomorrowuntil Wednesday, September .It will be based in the Teviotdale Leisure Centre car park on Mansfield Road, with tests available between pm-pm.An NHS Borders spokesperson said: \"The MTU can only take a limited number of people each day so it is essential that only people with COVID- symptoms book a test.\"Other household members must self-isolate but should not be tested unless they too are showing any symptoms.\"The symptoms of COVID- are a high temperature or fever a new continuous cough or a loss of or change in sense of smell or taste.\"Tests, which must be booked in advance, can be arranged by visiting this websiteor calling  .The new unit will run alongside the existing facility in Galashiels Netherdale car park, which will operate betweenam and pm.If travellingto a mobile unit is not possible, people can arrange for a home test kit to be posted through their door.NHS Borders jointdirector of public health, Tim Patterson, said: \"I realise that people in Hawick will have concerns about the virus as a result of this outbreak.\"Unfortunately this can lead to the circulation of unsubstantiated rumours, especially on social media.\"I would like to re-iterate that it is crucial for everyone in the community to follow our advice and avoid speculation and rumour about the outbreak.\"Dr Patterson added: \"In terms of schools, all education settings in Hawick are currently safe places for children to learn.\"Unless your child has been asked to self-isolate by NHS Borders Test and Protect team they should attend school as normal.\"However it remains vital that no child attends schoolthey are displaying any COVID- symptoms.\"At the time of publication, a total of nine new cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the Borders in recent days,bringing the regions total to  since the outbreak began.To book a testing unit appointment or a free home testing kit, visit: www.gov.uk get-coronavirus-test or you can call:   "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-book-covid-test-testing-centres","story":"In the last week, demands for Covid testing in Scotland have surged.The First Minister suggests some Scots have had trouble trying to book coronavirus tests over the weekend due to a \"major spike\" in demand, which resulted in technical issues.Butyou are experiencing symptoms, how do you get a test  Heres everything you need to know.When should you take a test If you think you are experiencing symptoms of coronavirus, you should take a test.

Itrsquos not so easy to access, but the fact the trees are now under threat made me want to discover the place before it might be too late. As I write, the decision has yet to be made on the fate of the trees.Irsquom a lover of history and totally understand the need to create a safe, weather-proof home for these historic planes, and to keep the museum as much an authentic visiting experience as possible. But there is a huge amount of space in the existing museum area, so the destruction of woodland seems unnecessary.The museum argues that any additional modern structures near the runway will undermine the historic look of the airfield. The proposed new visitor centre will, they say, create much-needed new jobs. So cutting down the trees to move the planes and create a new home for them is, the museum authorities argue, the only realistic option for them. They say that refusal of their plans will put the new jobs at risk.I totally understand the need for jobs at this time in particular, but the trouble is the approach taken by the museum is part of the reason the world is facing an ecological crisis with deforestation, the destruction of habitats and the extinction of wildle. It is part of the mindset that sees nature as ldquoin the way of development.Donrsquot be ridiculously dramatic, I hear some folks say this is not the Amazon or a rainforest in Indonesia, itrsquos a small wood in East Lothian.And that is precisely the point. It is a small but very rare example of a wood with mature trees in our county. It is a special place, with a ersity of trees and buzzing with wildle. Walk under its canopy and you will discover that. I know itrsquos proposed to plant new trees in a dferent area as compensation, but this wonrsquot connect to the wood and will take generations to grow. It will never replace what will be lost.If we seriously want to do something about the ecological disaster we are making on our planet then we need to start in our own backyard. We canrsquot campaign against deforestation, habitat destruction and declare a climate emergency, and then say: ldquoWell, the rules donrsquot apply to us when we want to destroy woodland to move some planes.Deforestation has a multitude of justications all over the world: dam building, road construction, cattle ranching, extreme poverty of subsistence farmers, profit from timber, oil exploration and pipelines, mining: the list is long. The point is there will always be someone with an economic justication for environmental destruction.While it may be on a much smaller scale, the proposal to destroy irreplaceable woodland in order to move some planes is a product of the same mindset that has brought us to a point of environmental and climate crisis.This mindset is revealed in the Historic Environment Scotland response to the proposal. This is the public body charged with protecting Scotlandrsquos built heritage. It has said: ldquoWe would not consider the trees of Sunnyside Strip to be directly related to the cultural signicance of the scheduled monument ndash they are visible but do not relate to our understanding of the monument as a wartime airfield.In other words, woodland isnrsquot part of our heritage mature trees, many of which were around before the war, arenrsquot historic or worthy of value in themselves. Really The wood is far more a historic part of the wartime airfield site than the massive car park. It seems to be a very selective viewpoint.The truth is that the UK is one of the most nature-depleted countries on the planet. A quarter of our already-decimated wild mammals are in danger of extinction. Our woodlands are small and dispersed, but all the more vital for the habitat they provide. East Lothian has huge developmental pressure, and this wood is a rare and vital part of naturersquos increasingly precarious foothold in our county.A changed mindset would be one which makes the protection of nature and the environment the initial default position. Developers should then take this priority as the starting point for proposals.That hasnrsquot happened with this plan, and credit to the council for rejecting it.There has been so much publicity and justied outrage recently over the destruction and littering of our land by people lsquowildrsquo camping and disrespecting nature. So many people, it seems, just donrsquot care, or seem unable to appreciate the gt of our natural environment and its importance.There is a disconnect from nature at the heart of this. We will never solve the environmental and climate crisis we are in until we can foster love and appreciation of nature, of which we are a part. Our childrenrsquos future literally depends on this.And institutions such as National Museums Scotland should be part of the solution, not the problem. Instead of viewing the woodland as irrelevant to the visitor experience, it could be used to enhance it. The wood is a magic place, with younger trees growing amidst towering old mature ones.My kids were in wonder as they explored the wood, peering up at the tops of the trees, and an old oak caught their attention as its boughs seemed to dip asto say hello. We spent a wonderful hour being immersed in nature.Many of our children, in fact many adults, have limited opportunities to explore and enjoy such places. Imagine the extra possibility of a nature walk in the tall wood, where wildle thrives and trees older than the airfield can tell their story. This wood is not an intrusion for the visitor but a potential wonderful addition. Get the ranger service to do talks and tours about this amazing place, a treasure hunt use it to enhance peoplersquos connection to nature ndash an extra experience.Woodland is not just a habitat for wildle, itrsquos a habitat for us humans too. Enjoying nature and learning about its importance should not be seen as a contradiction to enjoying historic planes.While Irsquom aware that itrsquos only part of the wood under threat, the proposal to destroy a large section of it will result in a tragic loss of trees and the habitat they provide. But itrsquos not just the destruction in itself, itrsquos also the precedent and example it sets for future developments.I really hope the Reporter will uphold the councilrsquos decision, and the museum, which is a fantastic and well-loved historic place to visit, will consider a new location for the visitor centre. Then we will all be winners."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-august-18-20-1995-1970-1920","story":"lsquoENOUGH is enoughrsquo was the message from traders in North Berwick, reported the East Lothian Courier on August , .The opening of North Berwickrsquos sixth charity shop this week has sparked controversy ndash and fears have been raised that a seventh could be on the cards.Traders claimed the resort had now reached ldquosaturation point with fundraising outlets, which are now selling new goods in addition to second-hand items.They said the charities were setting up shop on prime sites, and argued that they were ldquosubsidising them through having to pay higher rates.Fears that the trend could ultimately lead to a downturn in the local economy and the death of the High Street as a shopping centre were also expressed.The row follows the opening of the Chest, Heart  Stroke Associationrsquos outlet at a former delicatessen shop in the High Street on Monday.A RE-ENACTMENT of the Battle of Dunbar was postponed as it clashed with a model power boat demonstration, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of August , .The re-enactment of the Battle of Dunbar, which is to be staged by the Royal Scots as part of their recruiting drive in East Lothian, has been postponed for a week because it would have clashed with the running of a model power boat demonstration to be held on Sunday, September .

The lsquomust-seersquo jewels that should be on the wish list of every tourist and local alike ndash the ones that actually surpass expectations and leave a lasting impression once yoursquove seen them.And for lovers of whisky, there are more than a few of these places too ndash the distilleries whose images take pride of place on websites and in magazines and which inhabit the dreams of fans around the world.The lonely trio clinging on to the rocks of Islayrsquos southern shore, their white walls standing as stark protection against the sea ndash Ardbeg, Lagavulin, Laphroaig.The architectural masterpiece that is Macallan, just outside the village of Craigellachie on Speyside ndash only a couple of years old, but already a global icon.And the old walls of the Blair Athol distillery in Pitlochry, so consumed by ivy itrsquos asthe stems and not the stone are keeping the place upright.Irsquove been to Islay, and to Macallan ndash and both more than lived up to my imagination. But while Irsquove driven past Blair Athol so many times Irsquove lost count, Irsquove never actually been able to go and visit.So when an invitation popped up on my email ndash come and visit, and bring someone with you. I would normally have been delighted. Irsquod been planning to take my dad for a day out, and this would normally have been the perfect thing. I would normally have been excited at the prospect of us both actually seeing first-hand this lovely little distillery.But, letrsquos face it, I wouldnrsquot normally expect such an invitation to come in the middle of a pandemic, and I wouldnrsquot normally need to do an impromptu risk assessment before accepting.The Scotch whisky industry is worth upwards of pound billion to the UK economy and millions of tourists flock to distillery visitor centres every year, eager to touch base with one of the most popular drinks in the world. In recent years, the industry has enjoyed record growth ndash and all the signs were that  would be another bumper season.But then Covid struck, the country went into lockdown, and visitor centres closed their doors.However, since last month, when restrictions began to ease and Scottish tourism began to get back to work, the industry has slowly been welcoming visitors.The owner of Blair Athol, drinks giant Diageo, is in the middle of its own rolling programme of reopening. It began with the Pitlochry distillery in the last week of July and will go on throughout summer and well into the autumn.At this time of year, a place like Blair Athol would normally see hundreds of visitors every day, with tour parties of  or more being guided past the giant mash tuns ndash where ground malted barley, or grist, is mixed with hot water to extract the sugars that will give le to the whisky ndash and given a peek inside the washbacks ndash where this sugary broth, or wort, is mixed with yeast and left to ferment to create a strong lsquobeerrsquo ready for distillation.Dozens more would normally just drop in to buy a bottle in the shop, or to enjoy a drink at the Mash Tun ndash a whisky tasting bar thatrsquos open to the public.But lsquonormalrsquo was the last word on our minds as my dad and I drove through the depths of Perthshire on our way to Pitlochry.Wersquod had to book our slot, as drop-ins are no longer allowed, and been given the usual spiel about precautions, social distancing, sanitiser and the like, but Irsquod heard it all so often by now that it barely registered. Itrsquos become like the safety briefing on a holiday flightbefore take off.Irsquove been to a lot of distilleries before, and normally I love the atmosphere, the peaceful way these places ndash in reality some of Scotlandrsquos busiest industrial sites ndash go about their business, but I didnrsquot know what to expect this time round. Would the experience be ruined, like a trip to the shops or a pint down the pub Wersquod been told to bring our obligatory mask ndash and warned that our temperatures would be taken.Groan.So as we walked up to the door and announced ourselves, I steeled myself for some military-style regime of control and discipline.ldquoHello, come in! The tour is about to start. Can I ask you to put your wrist up to the censor so we can check your temperature That was it hellip a little box on the wall not much bigger than a light switch. I held up my wrist as instructed and waited.ldquoBeep! Temperature normal.My dad followed and as the tape across the entrance was pulled back we proceeded to put on our masks.ldquoOh, no, you wonrsquot need these in here.And what turned out to be one of the best tours Irsquove ever been on had begun.Yes, there was sanitiser everywhere, and wersquod been asked to maintain our distance and keep to the one-way system, but far from being a hindrance, these quiet measures seemed to fit in with the feel of the place, and did nothing to detract from the tour.There were only four of us on the tour, and the usually busy public areas were deserted, so it felt aswersquod been given secret, after-hours access to the distillery.It was aswe had the place to ourselves and Karen, our guide, was our accomplice as we sneaked from room to room, past the mash tuns and the washbacks, and into the still room. We stopped here as Karen explained the distilling process and, despite the insane heat of production, we stayed a little while extra to chat and take pictures. This personal touch was a real and unexpected treat.We carried on like this right through the tour ndash Karen passing on her prodigious knowledge, us chatting and stopping to admire the beauty of the distillery. No crowds, no rush.The final pleasure was when we were led into the Mash Tun bar to sample the whisky. It was like an exclusive tasting normally only reserved for the big-rollers and high-payers. I was driving, so after a quick snf of each dram ndash Blair Athol -year-old, Blair Athol Distillery Exclusive, Auchroisk -year-old, and Talisker Storm, in case yoursquore interested ndash I decanted them into the little sample bottles provided and saved them for later.Dad, on the other hand, loved every second of this private display, and after chatting a while more to our fellow guests and Karen ndash ldquostay as long as you like, she reassured us ndash we nipped off to take more photos and visit the distillery shop.The shop was the only place where masks were needed, but it didnrsquot stop us marvelling at the goodies on offer, and chatting some more to the staff who seemed to be relishing this newfound ability to escape from the timetable.Dad bought a bottle, of course ndash Talisker Storm ndash and as we said our goodbyes and took a few more pictures, I vowed to be back in more normal times.But then again, maybe I wonrsquot wait until then and instead book another secret visit when it feels aswe have the place to ourselves.Maybe this new normal has something going for it after all.# Andy Clark is author of the Dr@m whisky blog.

Although their summits are mostly rounded and sweeping, they combine to make a vast and wholly unique landscape.The mountains in the Cairngorms rise up out of the remnants of the ancient Caledonian pinewoods and are home to superb wildle and an array of dramatic corries. Braeriach is the third highest mountain in the British Isles and is protected by a long approach walk through a natural tree line.This Munro comes in at km and takes around - hours to complete.Braeriach, Aviemore, PH QTBraeriachBeinn Alligin, TorridonBeinn Alligin, meaning jewelled mountain, is one of three of the Torridon giants and well deserving of its name. This magnicent pair of munros has its own pinnacle ridge called the Horns of Alligin.Sitting on the seaward side of Torridon it has an unmatched viewpoint with glimpses of Skye and the sea to one side, and great peaks on the other side with the Horns providing a stunning foreground.The Munro is around km and takes around - hours.Beinn Alligin Torridon, Alligin, AchnasheenBuachaille Etive Mor, Glen CoeBuachaille Etive Mor is the head of Glen Coe and reigns supreme with its awe-inspiring pyramidal appearance. It is affectionately known by many climbers as the Bookie and, along with its twin Buachaille Etive Beag, are among the most photographed of the Scottish mountains and itrsquos easy to see why!This Munro is perfect for those who want a climb and some incredible views.It is around km and takes around - hours to complete.Aonach Eagach Ridge, A, Ballachulish PH HXLiathach, TorridonAnother of Torridonrsquos three mountains, Liathach is perhaps the finest of them all. Its higher Munro looks almost inaccessible from most directions and even the easiest ascent involves a bit of scrambling but itrsquos certainly worth the effort.Beyond this point the mountain becomes even more dramatic and offers the perfect path for thrill seekers to climb to the top. The hidden north side of the mountain is even more spectacular and is well worth exploring.Slightly longer than the other of Torridonrsquos mountains this walk is around .km and takes around - hours.Achnasheen, IV ETLiathachSgurr nan Gillean, SkyeMany regard Sgurr nan Gillean as being the finest peak on Skye and it is one of the more dficult on this list. Even the easiest ascent on the southeast ridge is a pretty tough scramble ndash the other two ridges venturing into the realm of rock climbing.It appears fairly dramatic from Sligachan but this actually conceals much of the mountainrsquos finest features and its only upon a closer visit to Coire a Bhasteir that the true scale and magnicence of the Pinnacle Ridge reveals this Munrorsquos true stature.This walk is around km and takes roughly  to  hours to complete.Skye, IV SW"},{"url":null,"title":"eight-best-cars-family-staycation","story":".

Across the UK, as headlines foretold the devastation lockdown would wreak on this seasonal trade ndash footage of acres of wilting plants was grim ndash cannier businesses immediately shted to online and telephone orders. And, as recent figures show, people responded enthusiastically. During that period, Britons spent around pound. billion on garden plants, materials and tools. Contrary to the stereotypical picture of a Mr McGregor retiree, footering around in his potting shed, it was millennials who spent most. Their investment was double that of the rest of us, with the - age group spending an average pound per person, compared with pound among others.Some of that might be explained by the urgent need for equipment to turn a rectangle of grass into a more imaginative space for all the family to enjoy. Irsquom long past their age but still so new to gardening that I recall those early months as a ceaseless outlay on shears, secateurs, spades, forks, trowels, rakes, sieves... I could go on. Hence the need for a shed, which was soon festooned with tools dangling from hooks, propped against walls and stacked on shelves. Think of an Italian deli, with hams and salamis overhead, and floor to ceiling storage. Replace the delicious aroma of cheeses, coffee beans and truffles with potting compost, muddied buckets and oil to keep blades moving, and you get the picture.There are professional horticulturalists where I live who are well under , but thatrsquos probably not surprising. Those who choose to live in the country are already keen on the outdoors, whatever their vintage. Yet there is something of a renaissance occurring in this generation, as interest in their own plot is sparked into le, whether itrsquos an allotment, balcony, or back yard.In response to what you might call a growing trend, Alan Titchmarsh has said that he hopes more young folk will be encouraged to pick up their trowels and dig up drives, to help protect the planet. ldquoItrsquos not just about going on marches, he says. ldquoBeing practical is a hugely underrated resource and skill.Those who have unexpectedly found themselves with time to devote to their patch have probably realised how enjoyable it is too. Being in the fresh air, surrounded by birds, and perhaps with children larking around, has shown how much pleasure can be had in maintaining your part of the world. At this stage of le, competition for peoplersquos spare time is usually ferocious, with the demands of socialising, keeping fit and raising a family. In the past, unless you were actively emulating the Good Le, choosing to spend the weekend planting drills of potatoes or deadheading roses was borderline eccentric.Being forced to spend so much time at home has clearly made people reassess their outdoor space, and consider its potential. Making their plot child-friendly has been a priority for some. But for those who dread the thought of a football landing on tender seedlings and new blooms, there should be no conflict between serious cultivation and youngsters ndash quite the opposite. The earlier children encounter flowers and trees and the wildle they attract, the better for all our futures. And the sooner they recognise the need to treat living things with respect ndash although some trampling and breakage is almost inevitable ndash the more they will understand not just how nature works, but the ways in which we can support it.Irsquove lost count of the number of people who have said how much they have relished this aspect of lockdown. Having nowhere  to go has allowed them to concentrate on matters horticultural, and take time to make decisions or try experiments they otherwise could not have attempted. Having many more unfilled free hours has its upsides, as one neighbour has discovered. When the pandemic took hold she turned her greenhouse into a hotbed of tomatoes and her flowerbeds into a lettuce patchwork, and has been feasting on salads all summer. As have her friends.Inevitably, once the world opens up again, some recent converts will lose interest and the weeds will take revenge. Yet I have no doubt that many will already be hooked. The secret that no gardener ever mentions is that it is addictive. Each tiny success gives confidence to try something more adventurous. Mistakes are inevitable, but so are accidental triumphs. The thrill of discovering strawberries or nasturtiums thriving where before was a bed of nettles, is inspiring. The sight of bees and birds hovering for nectar, seeds and grubs is like preparing a banquet and watching as guests pile their plates high. To be honest, environmental reasons for sustainable, eco-friendly gardening are all but forgotten in the joy it brings. The reason why benches in most well-tended grounds go largely unused is because therersquos always something clamouring for attention. To sit sipping a GT while an unpruned shrub stares at you reproachfully, or a juicy stick of rhubarb cries out to be picked, is almost impossible.In my own limited experience, trying to keep on top of it all ndash and never coming remotely close ndash is part of what it is about. An expert recently told me that a garden will take all the time you give it, and then some. Yet the depths of winter is the time to put your feet up . The rest of the year is for helping the green things around you put down sturdy roots. As millennials can confirm, it has a very stabilising, calming effect on us too.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Fortunately, HM Treasury has bailed Scotland out in this Covid crisis, so, while the - figures will be excruciating, Scotland will survive, thanks to taxpayers in the southeast of England. Would anyone who can count support leaving the UK under these circumstances Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh EH.THE publication of the latest GERSfigures has triggered a now-traditional feeding frenzy.A black hole in Scotlandrsquos finances is heralded by unionist politicians as validating the continuation of their beloved Union.The killer phrase for me from the GERS report is: ldquoThe report is designed to allow users to understand and analyse Scotlandrsquos fiscal position under dferent scenarios within the current constitutional framework.GERS is therefore a measure of the public finances, under the current Union, hardly the greatest endorsement for how the economy has been managed on the UKrsquos watch.Major economic levers required to stimulate economic growth are still currently reserved to Westminster.It is indeed a bizarre scenario when politicians from unionist parties, who should be ashamed at the situation, actively gloat and support a Union that has mismanaged the economy so appallingly.GERS is a set of figures, based on a measure of guesswork that indicate very little, except highlighting the negatives of the current Union. It has little bearing on the finances of an independent Scotland.The point of independence is not to do everything in the same way as it has been done within the current constitutional framework, but to move away from this one-size-fits-all fiscal straitjacket to a tailored approach that prioritises stimulating economic growth.Alex Orr, Edinburgh EH.TODAY the annual GERS numbers have been revealed and no doubt there will be the usual bunfight about their relevance to the constitutional debate. If I might take a dferent tack: the SNP administration is to be congratulated on its determination to publish these figures annually. Not every political party would persist in publishing economic data which has the potential to destroy its raison detre.In a sea of misinformation and spin, GERS stands out as a beacon of truth and accuracy. When we are told that Scotland is doing so much better than the rest of the country on Covid- deaths, but the statistics show dferent, we still have GERS to restore our faith in objective facts. When the first serious outbreak of Covid- in the country is in Edinburgh but the First Minister forgets to tell us about it, we have GERS to remind us that some uncomfortable truths can still make in into the public domain. When we are told that ministers have no say in infectious patients being discharged into care homes but official letters show dferent, when the Education Secretary endorses an equation that seriously disadvantages working class pupils, and when the same Education Secretary does a u-turn on his equation and claims that makes it all right, when Cabinet Secretaries deny that fiscal transfers happen while demanding the continuation of the UK furlough scheme, when the First Minister says we have extra Covid testing capacity but people from Glasgow are told to go to Belfast for a test, GERS is an important truth that we can hold to, a shining light in a murky forest of obfuscation and incompetence. And when we have a succession of Finance Secretaries whose economic qualications seem to be the possession of the requisite numbers of fingers and toes, its nice to know that some competent people are actually keeping the score.So, when we are told that independence transcends everything and that all routes through independence would lead to a prosperous sunny upland, the SNPs own GERS publication is there to remind us, and itit has the wit and honesty to admit it, that such a view is the acme of economic illiteracy and, in the wise words of a prominent nationalist politician, stupidity on stilts.Alex Gallagher, Labour Councillor, North Ayrshire Council, Largs.THANK you, Iain Macwhirter, now we have an article on independence that is relatively neutral in tonereceives a large tranche of its electricity and gas from us, so would be daft to restrict trade on political grounds. A new trading arrangement should be ldquothe easiest in history to reach.Sharing a currency with a country whose economyis erging from your own cannot work. All new countries, like the Czech Republic and Slovakia, adopt new currencies almost immediately, and that is what Scotland should aim for. It is ridiculousthat we have no clear break-down of Scotlandrsquos economy, revenues, GDP, expenditure, perhaps only months away from independence, because the UK government will not direct the civil service to provide this information. No serious economist would trust GERS to provide other than the vaguest guestimate of our fiscal position post-Union. A lot will depend on the nature of the dissolution and the subsequent allocation of assets. Funnily enough, that is something unionist politicians commentators donrsquot ever like to talk about. If independence is a serious proposition, then it behoves the media to start asking questions of both sides.GR Weir, Ochiltree.ALAN Fitzpatrickclings desperately to the \"once in a generation\" anthem and wondersstatements in the Scotlands People publication \"could be construed as amounting to a verbal contract with the electorate\". Mr Fitzpatricks memory appears to be selective as he makes no mention of the infamous \"Vow\" to which all three unionist party leaders signed up and promptly forgot about and as for Mr Fitzpatricks comment regarding the old saying that \"an Englishmans word is his bond\", the word was that Scotlands position in the EU could only be guaranteed by voting No to independence, and the bond was broken at the EU referendum so much for that \"verbal contract\".I would remind Mr Fitzpatrick that the SNPs  manesto stated that there would not be a second independence referendum, unless there was \"a signicant and material change of circumstances, such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will\".

This resulted in  new cases being detected - a positivity rate of . per cent.In the seven days to August , the number of people being tested had risen sharply to ,, with  new cases identied - a .% positivity rate.Many of these iniduals will have been tested more than once across the NHS and community sites we are now performing more than , Covid antigen tests per week - the highest turnover since the pandemic began.: Scotland to roll out -minute Covid testsDespite this sudden upswing in demand - and bearing in mind that the vast majority of testing is carried out on iniduals with possible Covid symptoms - % of those tested are still coming back negative for the Sars-CoV- virus.While some of these may be  negatives, it is also a strong indicator of just how many non-Covid viral infections are circulating in the community causing coughs and fevers.Young children have also long been known to be lsquosuperspreadersrsquo of colds and flu - yet the same does not appear to be true for the newest strain of coronavirus behind the pandemic.Emerging evidence suggests that older children aged  and over can infect others with Covid in much the same way as adults, however, leading the World Health Organisation to update its guidance to advise that teenagers should wear facemasks in certain circumstances.There is less concern about the danger of the virus to children and adolescents per se. The evidence is overwhelming that the age group is at extremely low risk of serious illness or complications.The real alarm surrounds their potential to pass the infection on to adults on campus, or to bring it home to family members who may be a greater risk.Yet even this is unclear.: Fresh call to lt cap on medical school intake for A Public Health England study published on Sunday analysed outbreaks linked to primary and pre-school children during June.Of the million or so children attending,  children and  members of staff were infected in  separate outbreaks - but PHE said most had probably been caused by staff members infecting other staff members, with only two instances apparently linked to pupild infecting other pupils.However, a study by French epidemiologist Arnaud Fontanet at a school in France found that although younger age groups do not \"transmit to the same extent\", \"teenagers are just as contagious as adults\".Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor of cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, told the Independent that it was best to ldquoerr on the side of caution when discussing whether the coronavirus can be transmitted to adults by children.ldquoTherersquos not a mountain of evidence on both sides,\" he said. \"The fact is we know very little about this, precious little.The bottom line, however, is that our testing capacity has not kept pace with the predictable surge in demand caused by schools reopening.The same pattern is occurring in countries such as South Korea, where schools in Seoul were forced to close and revert back to distance learning this week after the th consecutive day of triple-digit daily increases in coronavirus cases. At least  students and teachers have tested positive over the past two weeks in the Seoul city region.Germany too was forced to completely or partially close some of its schools or quarantine pupils and teachers within days of the new term two weeks ago. In Berlin,  schools have been affected by Covid- cases.The messaging in Scotland was clear: schools could only open safely as long as anyone with possible symptoms stayed home and got tested straightaway.: Contact tracing will only prevent outbreakstesting carried out within  hours of symptomsModelling by academics from University College London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that reopening of schools in England in September could lead to a second, bigger wave of coronavirus by December unless a \"comprehensive test, trace and isolate strategy\" was in place. This took into account other factors - such as parents being freed up toto offices- but it illustrates the importance of sufficient and rapid testing capacity.The fact that our testing capacity has been overwhelmed so quickly - evensome of it is confusion among people told to self-isolate wrongly seeking tests - is far from ideal.On the plus side, the test results we do have so far indicate that Covid is only behind around one in every  cases of flu-like illness."},{"url":null,"title":"labours-richard-leonard-dragging-party-him-fmqs-ineptitude","story":"Mr Leonard, who was ignored calls for him to quit ahead of next years Holyrood election, was accused of entering ldquopolitically suicidal territory after pressing Nicola Sturgeon on a host of issues the First Minister has already committed to.

Her bobbed hair, designed by Vidal Sassoon, also added to Quantrsquos recognition factor.

In addition, pound.bn is removed from Scotlands accounts for UK defence , plus pound.bn for other UK services home and abroad, all of which a Scottish government with dferent priorities could reduce.Many small European countries have matched the UKrsquos Covid financial response and last year Norwayrsquos government raised almost pound billion from oil and gas revenues compared to the pound million attributed to Scotland, which is a lasting testament to Westminsterrsquos mismanagement and over-generous tax allowances.Unless we take the opportunity to change things with self-government, Scotlandrsquos fiscal position will only get worse after Brexit as the UK, despite consistently failing to balance its books, faces a decade of austerity.Mary Thomas, Edinburgh EH.IT would appear that Jill Stephensonis content to sponge off the taxpayers of the southeast of England. What a shameful position for anyone to take, either in a personal capacity or as a Scot.Scotlands economy has suffered a succession of catastrophic impacts at the hands of a succession of right-wing ideologically-driven governments, starting with Margaret Thatchers scrapping of Scotlands industrial capacity in the s, through the financial disaster of  and culminating with Brexit in . The fact that oil from Scotlands territory subsidised the de-industrialisation of the s and then supported the expansion of the City of Londons financial sector only underlines the irony of the position held by Ms Stephenson.Scotland will have the freedom to grow its economy only when it is free of interference by Westminster. The next catastrophe, of course, is going to be Brexit. Scotlands population has expanded steadily since ,, but that growth will stall as soon as Westminster is able to deny the immigration we need here. Scotlands GDP is considerably smaller than near neighbours with similar populations such as Norway, Denmark, Ireland and Finland, the reason for that is that these small independent countries can tailor their economies to their needs, not the needs of the city of London and the South East of England.Scotland doesnt need nuclear submarines, aircraft carriersor global military reach, all of which cost a lot more than the pound. billion that Ms Stephenson claims, but we do need infrastructure, health care, education and above all people to grow our economy.The GERS figures may seem to be a godsend to people who think like Ms Stephenson, but all they really do is underline the structural failures and weakness of the United Kingdoms economy.John Jamieson, Ayr.IT is sad to say that some who would refer to themselves as Scots appear proud of the fact that under the current constitutional arrangements Scotland seems, at least on a superficial level, to be \"subsidised\" by the rest of the UK. Of course not only is this assessment distorted because Wales, Northern Ireland and the North of England are apparently more heavily dependent on the largesse of Londoners, but because only tax revenues directly attributable to Scotland are included in Scottish revenues raised while non-directly attributable expenditures, such as defence, are pro-rated by Westminster.Of course the deliberately conjured smoke and mirrors hide the slanted workings of the UK economy which leverages resources from outside of the south-east of England to maximise the financial growth of London. Scotland was effectively in surplus for most of the last four decades but not only was no oil wealth fund created for the benefit of future generations, Scotland did not even obtain close to a population proportion of the massive infrastructure spending in and around London, an economically debilitating relative predicament which is set to continue for the foreseeable future . The people of Scotland are just as capable as those of our southern neighbour, but we can only prosper in accordance with our collective talents when we can invest all our resources in our own country.Stan Grodynski, Longniddry.THE annual furore over the GERS figures is now in predictable full swing. No one has ever seriously uttered the popular grievance mantra of \"too poor, too smallrsquo with regards to Scotland.But this isnrsquot  any more. Oil prices have plummeted.

The global economy is reeling and climate instability is increasing.How much would an independent Scotland borrow, how would the deficit be dealt withincreased taxes or a reduction in services, or both. Or neither  How would Scotland be a competitive place for business The SNP needs to start tackling the \"known unknowns and \"unknown unknowns\" of Scottish independence with a rigorous hard factual honesty that it has yet to muster, lest we all vote for a st century version of the Darien Scheme at some point in the future.Surely the people of Scotland deserve better than the \"Nah, itll be fine\" attitude that the SNP have been peddling for six years now.David Bone, Girvan.YET again Ruth Marrtrots out the untruth that The Vow was forgotten by those who committed to it, so once again, it is necessary to refute that assertion.The Vow of September  was signed by Prime Minister David Cameron, Deputy PM Nick Clegg and Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband and promised three things and three things only. These were: statutory protection for existence of the Scottish Parliament new extra powers for that Parliament and the preservation of the Barnett Formula. Of these, the first two were enacted in the Scotland Act  . The Barnett Formula also remains intact.Likewise, Ms Marrs claim that a No vote would guarantee EU membership is a distortion of the truth.

Confidentiality requirements preclude me from sharing the particulars my experience but I took actions on these lines in a number of settings.ldquoThe limiting cases were, of course, situations where a formal complaint was brought against a Minister, and or there was presenting evidence that an egregious act had been committed.ldquoIn these cases, formal procedures would be followed.Sir Peterrsquos predecessor, Sir John Elvidge, also told the committee that civil servants often excused bad behaviour by ministers because of their stressful jobs, but this could lead to bad behaviour snowballing.He said: ldquoSome civil servants tended not to interpret as bullying any behaviours which they saw as a response to that stress,an inidual Minister did not display those behaviours at other times.ldquoIn combination with the strong cultural understanding that civil servants should exercise restraint in responding to personal criticism by Ministers, this tended to have the effect that Ministers did not experience the kind of feedback about their behaviours which might occur in other working environments.He also said civil servants may have been reluctant to complain about bullying ministers, as aggressive behaviour was seen as necessary for politicians to get ahead.Tory MSP Murdo Fraser, who sits on the Inquiry, said: ldquoIt is an extraordinary admission that problematic behaviour from ministers would be dealt with informally, and that these procedures took place lsquoin a number of settings.rsquoldquoWe have no idea how many times these informal discussions took place, who with, or most importantly, how serious the complaints were.ldquoBut itrsquos clear that Nicola Sturgeonrsquos position that she knew nothing about any allegations of inappropriate behaviour is becoming flimsier with every piece of evidence that comes out.ldquoThe First Minister cannot claim to have been in the dark, like the rest of us, when a number of allegations and complaints were taking place along the corridors of the SNP government.ldquoThe inquiry must hear from Nicola Sturgeon about what she knew and when she knew it.Labour inquiry member Jackie Baillie added: \"Scottish Labour deputy leader and committee member, Jackie Baillie, said:ldquoThis latest evidence to the Committee appears to confirm what has long been suspected: the workplace culture in the Scottish Government was not conducive to the wellbeing of staff and complaints about potentially serious issues were dealt with informally.ldquoIt is vital that all pertinent evidence is provided to the committee by the Scottish Government and other parties.ldquoThis revelation casts further doubt on the First Ministerrsquos claim to be ignorant of such behaviours occurring when it is clear that such behaviours were regular occurrences at the time.The inquiry is due to take evidence next Tuesday from Dave Penman, general secretary of the white collar FDA trade union, and Malcolm Clark, Convenor of the Council of Scottish Government Unions and President of the PCS union Scottish Government Group."},{"url":null,"title":"biffy-clyro-buffoons-run-country-nurses-deserve-paid","story":"Bfy Clyro on the buffoons who run the country, and why nurses deserve to be paid moreHandout photo of Bfy Clyro.

The gig is certain to be a sell-out, and the intriguing bill also includes Yungblud, Frank Carter and the Rattlesnakes, and Mercury Music Prize nominee Porridge Radio.The open-air shoe comes as the new album, A Celebration of Endings, has just topped the UK charts, as well as attracting some of the best reviews of their long career.On one level, then, things are going well for Simon Neil, James Johnston and Ben Johnston on another, however, there is still much for them to be angry about: about the \"buffoons\" in charge, about the treatment of nurses, about bands that play it safe.A Celebration Of Endings distils this anger into something bright and bombastic.\"We are living in a world right now in which politics cannot be ignored,\" drummer Ben Johnston said in an interview with Alex Green, the Press Associations entertainment reporter. \"We are not historically a political band and we are not about to become Rage Against The Machine.\"He pauses for a rumbling laugh. \"But I just think, right now, living in this world, you cannot ignore the buffoons in charge and all the crazy stuff that is going on.\"If you dont sing about it you are only lying to yourself because it is omnipresent.\"Ben was speaking just a week after he had reunited with his bandmates for their first rehearsal since lockdown.For the hard-touring outfit, the music industrys sudden grind to a halt was especially unsettling. \"The first few weeks were all over the place - a lot of fear,\" the -year-old admits.\"My regime went entirely out the window and I started putting on a bit of weight and sleeping crazy hours and all sorts of stuff.\"But once the novelty of that wore off I got some more routine back in my le and things are fine now.\"Johnston, who had no formal music training, has spent lockdown going back to basics, practising on a drum pad and improving his technique.Lockdown has also affected the band in other, more unexpected, ways.Hailing from Kilmarnock, Bfy Clyro are famous for their eccentric style of power rock, performing topless at every opportunity, and for their love of Kilmarnock FC.Football was one of the immediate casualties of the pandemic, but, now it has ed, Johnston appears to have fallen out of love with the game.\"Im definitely missing the Killie,\" he says. \"I really have missed the football, although weirdly since the English football came back - Scottish football hasnt come back yet - I realise I have slightly fallen out of love with football.\"I dont really know what happened. Im watching it, going This isnt as good as I remember and its really upsetting because I love my football.\"I think there are too many live games on a daily rate. I think thats just putting me off - Oh God, live football again.\"But no, I miss seeing my local team for sure. I miss going to my ground and shouting at guys in shorts.\"As you would expect, Johnston agrees that the arts need Government support and worries about how the pound. billion rescue package for the sector will be vied out.But hes equally concerned for the nurses, junior doctors and healthcare workers who have spent the last half-year on the front line of the pandemic.\"Im not one to get on my soapbox and start to worry about Government stuff,\" he admits. \"There are more important things like nurses - they need to be taken care of. They need all the support in the world.\"They need to be paid twice as much, regardless of this pandemic.\"They need to be given free housing, they need to be given all the help, not turning up to food banks trying to feed their kids because they cant get a good enough wage as a nurse.\"That pisses me off. They are not given nearly enough support and this pandemic has shown that the people who are paid the least on the social structure are the people we need the most.\"We need to take a long, hard look at ourselves, think about that wealth gap and fix it.\"Despite their studio wizardry and penchant for aural experimentation, Bfy Clyro are at their heart a live band.If you have seen their energetic stage act you will understand that this period away must have been painful.\"Its been heartbreaking,\" says Johnston after a long sigh. \"I completely forget what it is I do for a job. That happened so quickly, you wouldnt believe it.\"Even a couple of months, Im like Am I in Bfy Clyro  Did we play these shows  Its hard to even remember. I miss live music so much.\"The feeling you get from playing live cannot be replicated in any other manner. I miss it intensely.\"I was so happy to get back in the practice room just this week with the boys. Its the first time we have played since lockdown. Its such a release. Ive missed it heavily.\"He laughs at the suggestion that A Celebration Of Endings is Bfy Clyros most danceable album yet - but agrees.\"We have really broad tastes, We like almost every genre of music. We like making ourselves a bit unsure.\"You should always slightly question your music. It should always be on the edge of Is this brilliant or terrible  Im not sure but certainly not safe.\"The last thing we want to do is make safe music and call it in.

Unlike student nurses and midwives, however, those training to be a paramedic are not eligible for a bursary, despite being unable to take up part time work.  To add insult to injury, their counterparts in England do receive bursaries.“This lack of a level playing field risks putting off those we need to see coming into our health service.  The current arrangements do little to encourage young people to pursue a career as a paramedic and store up problems for the future.“When I wrote to the Health Secretary recently on behalf of a constituent, I was told the government has no plans to review the funding options for trainee paramedics. Today, Nicola Sturgeon said she would look into the matter, having also been approached by a young constituent, angry at the unequal treatment.“The First Minister needs to recognise that introducing a bursary scheme would make a real dference, not least in widening access to the profession.  It’s time the Scottish Government properly recognised the dedication of our trainee paramedics by putting them on the same footing as trainee nurses and midwives.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On the Pentland Firth, people are still being forced to pay over the odds.“COVID has inevitably created challenges, but even prior to the pandemic there seemed to be little urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver on its promise. Assurances that Ministers will now ‘pick up the ball again’ are likely to ring hollow with islanders who just want a date for cheaper fares to be introduced.“Meantime, Ministers could help soften the blow from the delayed introduction of RET by using the underspend to cut fares on Orkney’s internal ferry services.

The infrastructure proposals have been designed to enable Orkney to manage a transition away from fossil fuels, while continuing to generate social and economic benefit from ongoing oil and gas activity.The proposals will have #transformational# impact on Orkney#s economy and society. As well as creating as many  new jobs, there will also be a substantial number of job opportunities during the construction phase.OIC leader James Stockan said: “Our vision is to build a truly sustainable business that is a core economic asset for Orkney, but also a first phase in enabling a scale of investment and logistical capability for the UK, which will be of international signicance.“Prime Minister Boris Johnson clearly welcomed our ambition and Orkney’s potential during his recent visit to our islands, describing as a ‘fantastic idea’ our vision for Orkney as a low-carbon, zero-emissions hub of innovation, with Scapa Flow at its heart.“We believe the time is right to maximise the incredible natural assets and geography of Scapa Flow and Orkney, to ensure a long-term sustainable future for our communities. We are open for business now, and ready to work with potential investors and operators to develop the signicant strategic and international opportunities Scapa Flow offers.“The Scapa Deep Water Quay proposal has been included in the Islands Deal list of projects that has received funding commitment from the Scottish and UK governments, and we are continuing to ensure that the funding earmarked for this will be secured.”Central to the project is the unique geographical advantage of Scapa Flow, described by the council as the largest natural deep-water harbour in the northern hemisphere, as the potential setting for internationally signicant marine logistics to serve the new and emerging sectors, including low-carbon fuel transition and offshore wind developments.Scapa Deep Water Quay is seen as the optimal location for construction and operations and maintenance activities, associated with offshore wind, as well as for a liquefied natural gasstorage and distribution hub. At the same time, this infrastructure has the capability to accommodate semi-submersible s of all types, giving Orkney a unique UK competitive edge within the existing oil and gas market.The project team believes it could be delivered by . Other proposals, such as Hatston and Kirkwall, could take three or four years to deliver.Phase two will ultimately develop the islands’ smaller harbours and piers across the islands.Harbour users and key stakeholders were consulted from the outset, to help gain an understanding of the issues, constraints and opportunities associated with harbour infrastructure around Orkney, through workshops and interviews. The range of stakeholders includes local communities, harbour users, potential funders and environmental bodies such as Scottish Natural Heritage.Harbourmaster James Buck added: “Tackling decarbonisation is the strand that binds these proposals together, providing infrastructure and knowledge for renewable energy developments around our waters will allow us to reach climate change targets. “We will also look at the potential for net environmental gain through habitat reinstatement and enhancement.”According to the OIC, Orkney Harbours is one of the most erse and successful council-run port authorities in the UK, with an annual turnover of £ million and nearly , annual vessel movements.The council added that the exact timing of construction for each of the phase one masterplan proposals is not yet known.This will be determined over the next six to  months, and will depend on a range of factors including market requirements, funding and environmental considerations.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But this week he wished a fond farewell to his feathered friend and sent her on a southbound trip that involved local RSPB manager Helen Moncrieff, NorthLink Ferries and an Aberdeenshire-based horse transportation company, which offered to take Patricia back to her home coop.Patricia should be reunited with her grateful owner this weekend. Eighty-two year-old John Wheeler lives in the far-off village of Hucclecote ndash over  miles away.Mr Jamieson said his suspicions that he may have had more than just an ordinary pigeon on his hands arose when Patricia appeared reluctant to leave.ldquoIt was in our hen run and the hens were making a commotion, he said.ldquoIt was just a rag of bones. It had been released in Thurso.Further inspections revealed a ring on one of Patriciarsquos legs, and a white marking on the other.That led to an online trawl that uncovered a useful website which helped put Mr Jamieson in touch with Patricia#s rightful owner. for full story...Ryan Taylor has worked as a reporter since , and has been at The Shetland Times since , covering a wide iety of news topics.Before then he reported for other newspapers in the Highlands, where he was raised, and in Fe, where he began his career with DC Thomson.

The rest were reduced by a single grade and she has missed out on As in English, Biology and Modern Studies, as well as a C in Higher Chemistry.Eva said to have her grades knocked down so signicantly has made her “completely reconsider her career path”.Exams were cancelled this year because of Covid- and replaced with estimated grades based on past attainment, and the school’s previous exam record.The modelling system adapted by the Scottish Qualications Authority reduced the grades of around , results, with analysis suggesting youngsters from poorer backgrounds and historically poorer performing schools suffered disproportionately.In her letter, shared almost , times on Twitter, Eva said that “it was clear” that her grades had been signicantly adjusted “because I go to a school classed as underperforming”.Her letter calls for the system, which she describes as discriminatory, to be urgently investigated, adding: “The government has been pushing the ‘no wrong path slogan’ but why should pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and deprived areas be forced into a pathway they didn’t want and worked tirelessly to avoid”.Eva had been predicted in her fourth year to achieve  As and two Cs at national five level, but in her exams she improved to come out with five As and a B.She added that her school’s recent performance had been affected by staff shortages.She had stayed behind after school for extra tuition, aiming to secure a university place and a career in the field of medicine.“Any further efforts by pupils to achieve higher grades in schools which have historically underperformed has been disregarded, she added.“SQA results this year have been more about fitting the statistical trends than the inidual pupil.”According to the Scottish Government#s own statistics, the estimated . per cent of most deprived pupils who would have expected an A-C band at Higher was lowered to . per cent by the SQA#s moderation system.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.jpg","title":"royal celtic societys unique music","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWork has begun on processing the twenty entries received for a unique competition which set the country’s musicians the challenge of creating a new shinty composition.

Kerry McWilliams, the founder of Lightwork NI, a charity that has provided more than  sessions of direct support to families over the past two months, said the crossover between school and family le was a major issue for many of the people she has worked with throughout the pandemic. Kerry said they have found that while children were largely able to keep in touch with the outside world and their peers through the likes of social media, many were uncomfortable being taught by their parents. And she said the stresses experienced by some groups of parents, such as key workers or those who had lost their income, made it more dficult for adults to support their children effectively. Home schooling was a cause of signicant conflict and distress, she said. Parents told us they found it very dficult to get children to do the work children told us they were afraid of being found out.One nine-year-old boy told me, #I don#t want to do school work with my parents because they think I#m really smart and they#re going to find out I#m not - I get good marks because I cheat and copy and when they see I can#t do the work they#re going to know#. This was a common fear for children - a sense of discomfort as school invaded their homes and family relationships. Most children like to keep school and home separate. Parents felt exposed and vulnerable as they were unable to understand or support their children#s learning.Many couldn#t access ICT equipment or provide internet access for multiple children and this led to frustration. She continued: We have lived through a global pandemic, a moment in history unprecedented in modern society. Families I have worked with have all moved through paralysing fear, powerlessness and panic. They have taken a fresh look at what makes them happy, what is worth fighting for - we all realised it#s not toilet roll - and how far they have sleepwalked into a le they wouldn#t have consciously chosen, and don#t really want to go back to. I believe the legacy and consequences of lockdown will be signicant for everyone both in the immediate future and for many years to come.She said there are a number of steps parents can take in the coming weeks and months to ensure their children cope with theto school, including drawing upon the relationships that were built during lockdown and ensuring children#s voices are heard. She also recommended putting in place routines and precautions to ensure everyone feels safe: Then you can stop worrying. Our worries communicate to children - when you feel confident and optimistic, they will too.

The appointment was announced by the Secretary of State Brandon Lewis, with the appointment expected to last three years. It#s after the New Decade, New Approach agreement included a Government commitment to appoint a Northern Ireland Veterans# Commissioner. Mr Kinahan will act as an independent point of contact to support and enhance outcomes for veterans in Northern Ireland.He said he looks forward to setting up his office and providing a strong voice for some , veterans here. We all too often just remember their service in Afghanistan, Iraq, and our own Troubles, but forget about their work in other fields: tackling Ebola in Africa, the protection of shipping in the Gulf, the control and rescue of migrants, as well as the work done by them in African game parks protecting wildle from poachers, he said. Our Armed Forces are active in numerous countries throughout the world offering advice, help and training, often putting their lives at risk so that we all can enjoy ours. We should be proud of them and recognise their skills and the sacrices they and their families have made. We should welcome them back into society when they retire, ensure they are not forgotten are not put at any disadvantage. When they need help it should be there for them immediately.My role as Veterans’ Commissioner is to ensure that this is the case and that coordinated and effective delivery exists for all those who have served. I look forward to ensuring that this is so, he said. Ulster Unionist Party Leader Steve Aiken welcomed the appointment of Mr Kinahan, a former veteran himself. The announcement that Danny Kinahan has been selected as the new Veterans# Commissioner for Northern Ireland will be warmly welcomed by all veterans and the wider armed forces community across all of Northern Ireland. Danny has been steadfast throughout his long political career in fighting to see that our military personnel and their families are given the full recognition that they need and deserve. He will be a first-rate advocate for the many thousands here who have served and by his appointment, we have at long last, joined the rest of the United Kingdom in providing that very necessary representation.Mr Aiken said the appointment was a loss for the UUP as a party. As an elected representative for South Antrim he has served all of his constituents well in Council, the Assembly and in Westminster. As he steps down from all political involvement, we as a Party and I as Leader, wish him all the best in his new and vital role.”Alderman Mark Cosgrove added: Be under no illusions that although Danny has crafted a political career based on building consensus, cross community working and advocating the benefits of the Union, he is a man who beneath it all is a tough negotiator who will always do whatever it takes to deliver for the people he represents. The veterans to whom we all owe so much could not have a better advocate than Danny who will use his decades of experience in this sector to deliver on the many important challenges they face.Belfast Most ReadLet there be light: Derelict Belfast church transformed into heavenly homesEamonn Holmes faces criticism over #Rule Britannia# slavery debateCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Swann pledges to tackle #atrocious# hospital waiting times as one new death confirmedDetectives investigating Belfast bonfire attacks on police release images of inidualsUlster Rugby suspend training after Academy squad hit by outbreak of coronavirus,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The collapse of Stormont coupled with the Department of Health’s view that the school did not demonstrate ‘need and value for money’ led to delays. Finally, in May of this year Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill announced that it had been approved and would open in September . In an in-depth interview with Derry News reporter, Garrett Hargan, Professor Dubras speaks of her elation after discovering the long wait was over, about the hundreds of people who have expressed an interest to date and the wide-ranging benefits that training doctors locally will bring. googletag.cmd.push She also refutes any suggestion that the school will ever be relocated, talks about the prospect of health science courses moving to Magee to complement the medical school and new build projects in the pipeline which will enhance the learning experience for medical students in the city.  For readers who may not know, can you provide a brief background of your career path before taking on the role as Foundation Dean at the Magee Medical School  I’ve been a GP for a long time. My clinical background is that I worked in Southampton looking after homeless people for a long, long time. I was lead GP for a homeless service. googletag.cmd.push From a university perspective, I worked at the University of Southampton for quite a long time and had increasing roles in leadership and ended up running the medical degree programme. I went from there to King’s College in London where I was the Deputy Dean of Medical Education. We were doing a huge curriculum change in this very big medical school, one of the biggest schools in the country with about  students each year. So it was very sizeable and quite a challenge. Then I became the Interim Dean of Medical Education for nine months and then was ready for a new challenge and that’s when this job came up. I arrived in Derry in June . I was really excited about coming here because it was an opportunity to establish something new, obviously with a focus on General Practice. An opportunity to bring my own values to the school and my personal values which have kind of always been about social justice, access and community-based healthcare. It really aligned with the university’s plans. And that’s me in a nutshell. What are your thoughts on the city having lived here for two years now  It’s wonderful, I have felt so welcomed here. I was born and grew up in the Channel Islands, Jersey, and it’s a small community, coastal and I’m kind of used to being in a place where people know other people and I’m used to being somewhere that I can get to the sea. From that perspective I’ve loved it. But I’ve done things like joining Altnagelvin Hospital’s choir, I’m probably the worst member of the choir, but it’s just been lovely and a brilliant way to get to know people. I’ve started running, I joined Star Running Club. Everywhere I’ve gone I’ve been impressed by just how much of a welcoming place the city is. Why did approval for the medical school take so long  It took a little bit longer than I was expecting. But although the journey was a little bit longer and a bit lumpier than I had anticipated, it’s worth it. I think the outcome is a really great one. At this months Western Trust meeting a member of the board said the Department of Health put obstacles in the way. Is that true  No, I don’t think so. It’s been a very thorough process of working with the university to develop our outline business case. And I think the civil service have a responsibility to make sure that these things are robust. At the point where we submitted our final business case to them in October of last year I was confident it was well put together and robust. There was time required for them to consider that. And the Assembly was not in place which was an added dimension to the decision-making process because the civil service aren’t in a position to make that level of decision. So it took longer than any of us expected but with the benefit of hindsight, that was not wasted time. And the GMC process was ongoing in parallel anyway. They visited us in July last year and we did have to pause the process until such time as we had confirmation of student places. But once we resumed the process we were able to pick that up fairly quickly. A little bit longer but I wouldn’t say there was deliberate obstruction at all. How did you feel when it finally got over the line  Oh goodness, delighted. The announcement by the Deputy First Minister in May of our places was just so welcome and then the confirmation that we had by the end of June was equally, each step has been fantastic. But the one that made me feel most excited was the point where the GMC gave agreement that we could recruit staff and students. That was the most signicant for me when our external regulator said it was happy for us to progress. There is some fear in the city, which has been highlighted by local councillors, that the school could be moved given the history of courses being transferred to other campuses. Are there any guarantees that the medical school will not be moved to another campus  I don’t think there’s any question about that, Garrett. How many applications have you received so far for the course  They all go through UCAS and we don’t know how that is going until ious UCAS deadlines are passed. This morning we had the first of a series of webinars with people who are interested in studying with us. We had  people on this morning wanting to know about the programme. We’re running a test centre for The Graduate Medical School Admissions Testand we filled up our places within a week. There is a real interest in coming to study with us. Has a date been set for the GAMSAT  There are two opportunities, one is usually September and the other March. We became registered as a GAMSAT centre as soon as we got the go-ahead to recruit students. Because it’s an Australian company that runs GAMSAT, it’s the kind of gold standard for anyone going in to graduate entry medical school courses. Our September October sittings are full and they will release the dates for March and as soon as those are released people will be able to register. But in order to apply, people don’t have to have taken GAMSAT in those dates. There’s a two-year grace sosomeone did it in  they would still be eligible for our first round of applications. You’ve pointed out that it is not a post-graduate course or limited to people with medical qualications, but open to anyone with a : degree. What fields have applicants come from so far  The beauty of our programme is that we don’t limit it to people with bioscience backgrounds. My experience working with students on other GEMS courses and also the experience of our partner medical school, St George’s in London, is that there’s a real mix of prior backgrounds. You might have people coming in who’ve got Masters of even PhDs in biomedical related subjects but equally I’ve worked with people who’ve come in with degrees in music, who’ve been geography teachers, lawyers, and the interesting thing about graduate entry medicine is that we teach it students work in mixed groups so you’ll find you might have somebody with an English degree working with someone who has a Masters in mechanical engineering or a BSc in biomedical sciences and actually they all learn from each other and are all engaged in that journey. And the people who are non-bioscience in background learn fast and by the end of the first year they are all at the same level and all really benefited from that ersity in backgrounds. At this stage would you know anything about the geographical spread of applicants  We have a database of about  people who have been interested in following the programme and have probably been in contact with us for about three years. They’re fairly widely dispersed, quite a lot of them are from NI and spread out here. Some expressing interest from GB and other international students but there’s a limit to the number of international students any medical school can take. That’s set by the UK government because of the way clinical placements are funded and also going into the foundation programme to become fully registered with the GMC. There’s a cap on medical courses partly because of what it costs to train doctors but in addition to that it’s about the capacity of hospitals and general practices to take those students. We’ve got lots of interest but limited to what we can do internationally. What specic facilities do you need in order to provide the type of first-class course you envisage  We have a building identied for refurbishment. We will have students on campus for their first year and part of their second year. After that they’re largely out on clinical placements and coming back to campus for certain weeks, tutorials and so on. The estate plan is comprehensive to accommodate those students and we’ll be providing them with a range of resources rooms for learning anatomy, for learning clinical skills, communication skills as well as standard tutorial rooms. Do you have those in the current buildings at Magee  Absolutely. Is the aim to still have a new building along the riverfront   Absolutely yeah, we still intend to have our new building but we have the wherewithal and are ready for first intake on the campus.  Would the theory element of the course be taught there once it’s ready  That would be the expectation, yes. Is there any timeline that you’re aware of for that  As you know, the funding for that is within the City Deal process so there will be the standard contractual stuff that will go on. But we have space on the campus to not be pressured for time and ultimately our new build has to be right. It’s not like we’re going to have to move out within a particular timescale. Seventy students have been agreed to begin with a view to increasing that to . Are you confident it will be increased to  and in what timescale are you looking for that to happen  There are ongoing discussions with the Department for the Economy. In our business case we had a sense of how we want to grow year on year but we’re certainly happy to be delivering  doctors a year because that is a substantial addition to the Northern Ireland medical workforce. Does Ulster University have enough experience and expertise to supervise the medical school at council level  One hundred per cent, absolutely. You’ve heard us talk about the rigorous GMC quality assurance process and a lot of that process is about testing out with us, in a very robust way, a whole range of things that include senior level governance, support, commitment, resources so the GMC wouldn’t be permitting us to progressthey weren’t confident in the university’s ability to deliver this. Can you say anything about the plans for on-site teaching facilities at Altnagelvin that were mentioned at the recent Western Trust board meeting  We’re at an early stage of those conversations and obviously we’re working in a partnership with the Trust and we’ll be having conversations with them and with our colleagues at Queens University Belfast. So it’s early days yet with that. Were these plans included in a business case that has already been submitted  Oh yes, it’s costed. Absolutely. Was it with the department of health because a number of departments have said they have no knowledge of it  I can’t remember the details about which department, it was included in the capital requirements within the City Deal. Should health science coursesmove to Magee to complement the medical school and build upon that positive progress, and would you like to see them come  As you know there’s been a consultation on the future location of those courses which has been paused because we’re running a full equality impact assessment. So we’re aiming to resume that shortly. I think from an educational perspective, the more health professionals you are able to educate in the same place the better. Do you think the medical school approval will aid that case  I think it’s a signicant element. Are you confident it will happen and are you personally pushing for that move  It’s subject to consultation, Garrett, so I can’t pre-judge the outcome of a consultation. But you’ve read the consultation document so you know that that’s the university’s preferred outcome . What do you think about a cross-border university named in honour of John Hume that would link UU Magee, the Institute of Technology in Letterkenny  Sligo and North West Regional College   It has been proposed by the Irish government’s Higher Education minister, is that something you’d be supportive of  I think we have to recognise the impact of John Hume as a politician, peace maker and honorary graduate of the university. So John Hume had immense impact and I think we are very keen to work with the Hume Foundation to recognise his contribution in whatever way is most appropriate. And of course, as you know, his daughter is a GP locally so I think commitment to health and social justice are all things which align very much with my own personal values. We have a very strong working relationship with our colleagues at the Letterkenny Institute of Technology, with North West Regional College, so I think from my perspective, the university is going to continue to deepen those working relationships. Student numbers have dropped at Magee every year since. Does the university have to show that it is committed to the campus by delivering on long-promised expansion to , students  I think the mere fact that the university is committed to the school of medicine and training of doctors in the city is evidence of its commitment. Are you aware of a wider strategy to deliver on that promise  I don’t think there’s any doubt about the university’s commitment to the city, as I said, certainly in terms of training doctors, we’ve already talked about the university’s preferred outcome for the health sciences consultation so I think there’s absolutely no doubt about the university’s commitment. Id imagine you have a busy year ahead, what has to be done to ready the school for students in the coming months  As you can see from the university’s marketing material and my tweets and so on you’ll see that we’re actively marketing to recruit students. And we’ll continue that with webinars, we’ll be running the GAMSAT test in October, we aim to run our interviews in JanuaryFebruary of next year whether they are in person or virtual because of COVID. That will be us progressing student recruitment. Then there is staff recruitment which is due to go out in the next week or so. We have a recruitment strategy to get all of those people in post in time for the first students. There’s the building refurbishment, there’s procurement of our virtual learning environment and ious other bits and pieces. So, you’re right, there is plenty to keep us out of mischief. Looking to the future, what will the course bring to the city, and ultimately when these students are able to graduate, how much will that mean to local health care  My goodness, there are so many benefits. One is that we know from really good research over time thatyou train doctors locally they stay local. And will often choose general practice as a career. What it can do for the city first and foremost is, it will grow our health profession workforce. Second is, there is also a huge opportunity to improve morale amongst the workforce who are currently here because they can see real benefit in brining on the future. There’s nothing more exciting than actually working with medical students because they’re amazing people and you know that they’re going to make brilliant doctors. The third thing is that there’s a real opportunity to improve recruitment anyway, because people like to come to places that are involved in medical education. And another benefit is the fact that medical students don’t just stay in their university, they like to get involved with the local community through classes and societies, so they will often run resuscitation training courses for kids in schools, they might work with a range of community groups doing volunteering. So I think everywhere you turn you would see real benefits to the school the medicine and these students in the city.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It is not the first time he faced a challenge in that part of Ulster. He tells Liam Tunney his gripping story, outlining his reasons for wanting to break the stigma of addictionA County Derry man has spoken of his experience with addiction as he prepares for a fundraising challenge in aid of the organisation who helped him deal with it. Dean Groogan, from Ballinascreen, is raising money for the Cuan Mhuire rehabilitation centre in Newry by climbing the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains this weekend with a number of friends. The -year-old, well-known in south Derry for his story-telling and recitation talent, has spoken about his story to encourage others who may be struggling to seek the help they need. “I know a lot of people that need help, but they dont know where to get it or how to go about it,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I wasnt originally going to talk about myself, but I was talking to my girlfriend and people close to me and they said, why are you beating about the bush  “They saidI wanted to break the stigma, I had to be straight and honest, and it made sense. The more I tell my story, itll help people come forward and get help themselves.” Dean had been struggling with drug addiction for a number of years before attending the Newry rehabilitation centre, and says the continued fight to cover up his problems took its toll. “For a lot of years I was struggling. I can make all the excuses in the world about mental health problems, anxiety, depression and guilt, but I got deep into addiction with fake highs,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “I was covering up for a lot of years. I can wear a hundred and one masks and people would think I was in great form, but deep down I was a broken person. “I was hiding that for a long time and I tried a thousand times to get myself sorted, but I would not do it on my own. “It was put to me a few times about getting residential help, but I didnt want it, because it was a pride thing for me. I was embarrassed people would find out. “Eventually I had to put my hands up and say I needed help. I didnt lose my job or my family, so it wasnt rock bottom that way, but emotionally, I was at rock bottom. “I didnt know where to go, I was just a broken person in the depths of depression. Just a broken man. I had to get help and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” Dean and Pat McGinn met up a few weeks ago to record a video about Cuan Mhuire. Dean was introduced to Pat McGinn, a former Lord Mayor of Newry and someone who had been through Cuan Mhuire previously. He admits though, thatit wasnt for the intervention of his girlfriend Emma, and close family and friends, he might not have taken that step. “Cuan Mhuire saved my le, andit hadnt been for my girlfriend Emma and my close family and friends, I wouldnt have gone,” he said. “I wont say Cuan Mhuire did it all for me, because they dont just put a magic wand over your head and say thats you free, because you have to put in the work yourself. “I went in and gave it my all and Cuan Mhuire gave me three months to get my head sorted, myself straight, allowed me to recharge the batteries and I came out a dferent man.” Cuan Mhuire was set up in  by Sister Consilio in Athy, County Kildare. The Newry centre was built in  and originally catered for those suffering from alcohol addiction. These days, the spectrum of addiction is much wider. “In this day and age, its not as simple as a man lying drunk in the street. Drugs are everywhere, in every bar you go into, and its so easy for a young person to get hooked on something,” said Dean. “They try it for a bit of craic and the next thing they know, its a few months down the line and theyre in something they cant get out of. It destroys lives. “Drugs are a new thing, people dont really understand. I was speaking to a man who was drinking for years. He said he never touched drugs, butthey had been about in his day he probably would have. “Its so easily available these days and it wrecks families. It rips the soul clean out of you. For me, I detested myself. I knew what I was doing was wrong and that it was wrecking my le. “I just couldnt stop. Addiction is something that you cant get enough of, but that you detest. It was just ruining me and Cuan Mhuire was a le-saver for me.” The Cuan Mhuire centre in Newry. On Saturday, August , Dean and a group of friends will climb the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains to raise money for the centre. They are already well on the way to their pound, target, and are hoping the trip will be a fun way of raising money and awareness for Cuan Mhuire. “Eight of us are going to start off at six in the morning and tackle the highest peaks in the Mournes,” said the Ballinascreen native. “I know a few boys that have done it in around  or  hours, but were not going to break any records! There are a few men going to meet us halfway up and do us a barbeque, so itll be a days craic as well. “I know money donated to the charity is great, but stigma is the main thing, so Ill be pushing online about the residential care for people suffering with drugs, gambling or drink.” Dean wants to ensure that anyone who finds themselves in need of help knows where to access it, and is especially keen to help men who may be struggling and reluctant to act. “As men, we bottle a lot of things up, personal things like depression or anxiety and people turn to drink or drugs or other highs to mask them things,” he said. “They are taught from no age not to show any emotions, to bottle it up and be a man, and thats not the reality. Theyre turning to other substances to mask the pain and thats just not the way to go. “This is to let them know that places like Cuan Mhuire are out there and will help themthey come forward. “Anything can go through that door thats one thing I found out about it. There are all dferent age groups and all dferent backgrounds and religions. “There are people with plenty of money and people with none. There were even a few people who were homeless whose families want nothing to do with them. “Addiction doesnt care who you are, it will come for you regardless. Putting yourself out there warts and all isnt easy, butit helps someone, thats the reason for doing it.” For more information, visit the Mourne Mountain Challenge Facebook page, where you can find links to the Just Giving page, for those wishing to donate.

It is not the first time he faced a challenge in that part of Ulster. He tells Liam Tunney his gripping story, outlining his reasons for wanting to break the stigma of addictionA County Derry man has spoken of his experience with addiction as he prepares for a fundraising challenge in aid of the organisation who helped him deal with it. Dean Groogan, from Ballinascreen, is raising money for the Cuan Mhuire rehabilitation centre in Newry by climbing the seven peaks of the Mourne Mountains this weekend with a number of friends. The -year-old, well-known in south Derry for his story-telling and recitation talent, has spoken about his story to encourage others who may be struggling to seek the help they need. “I know a lot of people that need help, but they dont know where to get it or how to go about it,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I wasnt originally going to talk about myself, but I was talking to my girlfriend and people close to me and they said, why are you beating about the bush  “They saidI wanted to break the stigma, I had to be straight and honest, and it made sense. The more I tell my story, itll help people come forward and get help themselves.” Dean had been struggling with drug addiction for a number of years before attending the Newry rehabilitation centre, and says the continued fight to cover up his problems took its toll. “For a lot of years I was struggling. I can make all the excuses in the world about mental health problems, anxiety, depression and guilt, but I got deep into addiction with fake highs,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “I was covering up for a lot of years. I can wear a hundred and one masks and people would think I was in great form, but deep down I was a broken person. “I was hiding that for a long time and I tried a thousand times to get myself sorted, but I would not do it on my own. “It was put to me a few times about getting residential help, but I didnt want it, because it was a pride thing for me.

Jeananne Craig worked in the English capital and Dublin for more than a decade, reporting on breaking news and showbiz red carpets.  But after the birth of her second child in , the Rosemount woman decided to relocate to the city where she grew up. “I had a great time in London and some amazing experiences there, but like many Derry people living away from home, I always missed it,” Jeananne said. “We moved to Derry a year and a half ago and are so happy to be here, particularly in the last six months, when having a bit more space and being close to family and nature has been so important.” googletag.cmd.push With a growing trend for people looking to leave built-up cities for quieter, more affordable locations post-lockdown, Jeananne decided to share her experience and that of other ‘city quitters’ in a podcast. All Change Please is co-hosted by Jeananne, who now works as a freelance journalist and copywriter, and her friend and fellow journalist, Jayne Cherrington-Cook, who left London for Kent. They release new episodes fortnightly and interviewees in series one include s music royalty-turned-designer Pearl Lowe, who moved from London to Somerset, Irish presenter and illustrator Maggie Molloy, and original Big Brother winner Craig Phillips, who reveals he once rented a room from the shows notorious Nasty Nick. googletag.cmd.push We cover all sorts of topics, from the practicalities of moving, to working from home and making friends somewhere new - and whether people have any regrets about leaving a big city, said Jeananne. Its all done remotely with Jayne in Kent, me in Derry and our guest joining from wherever theyre based. I actually have to record in my parents house, my own is too noisy with two young children running around and wanting to join in, said Jeananne who, plans to include some well-known local names soon.The logo for All Change Please was designed by local artist Bronach Crabtee, aka The Crafty Crab. The plan is to attract listeners considering a move, but I think our interviewees have such interesting stories to tell, it will make a good listen for anyone looking for a new podcast to enjoy, Jeananne added. The first two episodes of All Change Please are online now, with new episodes released fortnightly on a Thursday. The podcast is available on iTunes, Spoty and Acast, and is on Twitter @allchangepod https:podcasts.apple gb podcast all-change-please id  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The guidance, announced this evening by Peter Weir, comes into effect from August . The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. googletag.cmd.push ”This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. “It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. “In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. googletag.cmd.push “In relationto communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible.  “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. “However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. “Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir added: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school. Parents should not send their children to schoolthey have any of the Covid- symptoms including: a high temperaturea new, continuous cougha loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At Benone Strand,a large amount of cans and broken bottles were left close to the beach boardwalk, while glass was also found on the sand at Castlerock along with discarded belongings and other items including plastic bottles and bags.

What did you do with your rubbish  Did you think it was acceptable to leave it behind  Did you expect someone  to clean it up for you  Litter is proving to be a huge challenge at this time, and we need everyone to take more responsibility. “Our beaches are one of our greatest assets and they are there for everyone’s enjoyment. Leaving broken glass where it can injure visitors,childrenandpets is adisgracefulact. I would ask those who did this how they would feela member of their family was badly injured because of their completely unacceptable behaviour  googletag.cmd.push “Parent and carers should share this message with their children so they realise that littering of any kind is wholly unacceptable. We need everyone to play their part to help keep our Borough clean.

It is understood that the mystery vessel was bought for pound with the unknown owner planning to convert it into an Airbnb boat.  Foyle Search and Rescue , the police and other relevant agencies responded to reports of the boat being stuck on Sunday when they offered the crew assistance. The vessel, Day Dawn N , was last known to be engaged in fishing. according to the Marine Traffic website. Another site, Vessel Finder, also states that it received the latest position of the boat at .pm on August . googletag.cmd.push FSR were tasked on Sunday last, following reports of a grounded vessel. Pat Carlin, of FSR, said the boat was likely to be there until mid-September when the tide would be high enough for it to re-float. “She’s stuck solid,” he added. “We went and assessed the boat, determined that the crew were safe and passed that information on to the police service,” Mr Carlin explained “We provided them with some basic supplies that they needed and basically the vessel is grounded and can’t be move until the tide is lted. “All relevant services were notied and are aware that it’s there.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Carlin continued: “I think they were up on the council pontoon and to the best of my knowledge they may have come from outside the area, I don’t know exactly. “They’ll have no choice but to wait, maybe with the sudden floods tonightthey’ll be lucky and might get re-floated otherwise they’ll have to wait until the tides are high enough.” The PSNI confirmed that police assisted partners, including FSR and Coastguard in liaising with the crew. A report from , shows that Day Dawn N  was bought for the purposes of fishing from Portavogie. It was said to be the first time the vessel had been based anywhere  apart from Kilkeel since her arrival in  from Banff where the wooden-hulled boat was built by John Watt  Sons as a trawler. Harbour master at Portavogie, Neil Warnock, yesterday said Day Dawn was based there but left a couple of months ago. “Somebody bought it for a pleasure craft,” he explained. “It’s not a fishing boat any more, the licence on it was sold off a while ago there. “The last I heard the boat was in Portrush, I saw a picture of it at Portrush harbour after it left here.” At Portrush, the assistant harbour master said the boat owner was only there for three days and he believed the man travelled from the Greencastle direction. He was trying to get himself a permanent mooring, he said, but wasn’t able to secure it. The owner left Portrush heading towards Derry where he tried to get a mooring in the town and ended up on the mud flats. “I just know that he bought that for pound. None of the fishermen like decommissioning so they basically would rather they go off. “So I think he bought it for a pound and wanted to change it into an Air B ‘n’ B, but we couldn’t offer him a permanent mooring in Portrush, so he was only here for three days,” the Assistant Harbour Master added. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Foyle Port added: “Foyle Port is aware that a small trawler has run aground at Madams Bank in the River Foyle. “There is no environmental threat or impediment to other marine craft. “Once conditions are right we expect the vessel to become buoyant again.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Shortly before nine oclock to be precise. Peter Buzzers back bar in Maghera is sparsely populated. Apart from the commentary, as Gaeilge, from TGs GAA  programme humming out of the TV on the wall, you couldve heard a pin drop. Its a Monday club with a dference. There are no boom boxes, no empty take away pizza boxes strewn around the tables nor half drunk people roaring into your ear while making little or no sense. Less than  hours earlier, two decades of concerted Slaughtneil planning and effort morphed into a slick hunger Loughgiel simply couldnt deal with. By the tenth minute, the maroon and white hooped juggernaut had broken into the orbit of Ulster hurling. Nine points clear and  months after the hurt of an extra time defeat by Cushendall, there was no catching them. googletag.cmd.push After the game, Chrissy McKaigue thanked every man, woman and dog involved in their success. Everyone except Thomas Cassidy, who had passed away days before. He waited until the inner sanctum of a packed Slaughtneil hall later that night, when back among their own. The Four Seasons Cup was clasped by one victorious outstretched fist. The index finger on his other hand gestured to the hall floor scarcely visible below the throngs of fans, where Thomas taught him how to play hurling all those years ago. There wasnt a dry eye in the house. Even the walls wouldve had goosebumps. On the Monday night, his brothers Mark, Declan and Bungazed at Buzzers TV with a look and a body language that money couldnt buy. Slaughtneil were at the top of the tree. The new Ulster champions had many helping hands to shape them along the way. But the Cassidys fingerprints were always prominent. Taking over the mantle of the Kellys, who sowed the seeds in the s. googletag.cmd.push Mark and Declan seemed like eternal minor managers when, in the beginning, silverware didnt always reward their toil. On a monsoon afternoon at Kevin Lynch Park, a saturated Bun thumped the roof of the then prefab dressing rooms to the sound of campeones. A team he managed with former minor winner Eoin McGuigan, that included Cormac McKenna and Chrissy McKaigue, had brought home the bacon. It was another building block. Also seated for that Monday viewing was Dermot Doherty, a selector under Michael McShane who is now running his eye over the minors. The apple doesnt fall far from the tree. His father Barney and the late Eugene Babs Kelly managed the clubs  winning team. It was a fitting reward for Barneys ferrying of average underage teams, year after year, in the back of his blue Mercedes van. Often on the lookout for a th player to make up a team that would iniably be on the end of many a hammering. An U shield at a blitz in Dungiven and a South Derry minor hurling final win against Lavey were the modest s for the effort. A FIRST FEacuteILE Below it all, another batch was coming to the fore to cut new ground. In , under Thomas and Barney and captained by current minor selector Adrian Quigg, Slaughtneil won their first ever Feacuteile title. By minor level, with direction from Mark and Declan Cassidy, back to back Ulster minor titles followed, from a group that also won a football title at St Pauls and lost in the final the following year. A generation that also produced current senior football boss Paul Bradley. Under Thomas wing, they won the senior title in  before being beaten out the gate by Dunloy in the Ulster final. It couldve been the beginning of dominance, but instead it was a last senior title for  years as Kevin Lynchs and Lavey ruled the roost. Armed with more coaches coming forward, the Slaughtneil underage hurling production line succeeded Ballinascreens time at the top. No longer was the journey south to the Feacuteile a novelty. It was a permanent fixture in the calendar. With it, came families bonding together and each success inspired the younger teams to follow. A new wave of minor glory at Ballinascreens Ulster tournament followed, but Kevin Lynchs were still the standard at senior level.  was supposed to be the breakthrough year. After winning a league title, Slaughtneils young guns were the pretenders to the Fr Collins Cup only to be sent home with their tail between their legs again by the Lynchs. It was neighbours Swatragh that took the cup for the first of eight seasons into the Granaghan parish where it still remains. The following year, under Mickey Glover, Slaughtneil eventually wrestled clear of Kevin Lynchs on their way to glory. In Ulster, their gung-ho tactics and bravery put Loughgiel to the pin of their collar in a moral victory to ascertain the level required. For the next two years they faced Cushendall in Ulster, but again came up short. All the while the underage production line continued. The Fr Collins Cup was present at one of the underage management meetings, almost as a sign of the level that needed maintained. With every year, came one or two new players into the squad. The fact that Michael McShane handed Shane McGuigan his senior debut in an Ulster final, while still a minor, was a sign of their commitment to growing the team to a height to challenge the big boys. McShane built a management team to match the players ambitions. Every base was covered. Cormac Donnelly came in as trainer. Their games were all analysed. Like the footballers and camogs, the strength and conditioning made them a finely tuned engine. The pre-game routine was planned to the nth degree, so that all the players had to do was turn up and deliver. And they did. Three Ulsters later and their stature on the national stage has soared. Cuala beat them in the manner Dunloy did in . It was followed by defeat to Na Piarsaigh, a game they surrendered from a position of strength. How times had changed. In the s, when Tom Magill had Lavey at their peak, just winning a championship game was a challenge. Now, not being happy after putting up a performance on the All-Ireland stage told enough about the ambition. The Ballyhale game was the greatest statement of intent, taking the giants of club hurling every step of the way. In the physical stakes, they were able to match them and in the skills of the game they were not found wanting either. In an epic, they came so close to the biggest day of all. This weekend, they enter the knockout championship stage again. They will have the favourites tag. There are no two ways around it. Last week, they saw off Na Magha with virtually a reserve team. Only Jerome McGuigan, suspended against Lavey, started from their All-Ireland semi-final team. Thats how far Slaughtneils hurling story has come. From the days when getting  players for a game was an achievement, they have set a standard of skill, attitude and athleticism that the rest of Derry must strive to reach. Success comes in cycles. In recent times, Kevin Hinphey has followed his father into coaching and led Kevin Lynchs to back to back Ulster minor hurling titles. They have been swimming in Slaughtneils wake, searching for ato the top table. The overall Derry hurling landscape needs them to narrow the gap. To do so, they will need to match an unrelenting hunger for more success. When you have had barren years like Slaughtneil, they wont want to step off their perch anytime soon.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Shortly before nine oclock to be precise. Peter Buzzers back bar in Maghera is sparsely populated. Apart from the commentary, as Gaeilge, from TGs GAA  programme humming out of the TV on the wall, you couldve heard a pin drop. Its a Monday club with a dference. There are no boom boxes, no empty take away pizza boxes strewn around the tables nor half drunk people roaring into your ear while making little or no sense. Less than  hours earlier, two decades of concerted Slaughtneil planning and effort morphed into a slick hunger Loughgiel simply couldnt deal with. By the tenth minute, the maroon and white hooped juggernaut had broken into the orbit of Ulster hurling. Nine points clear and  months after the hurt of an extra time defeat by Cushendall, there was no catching them. googletag.cmd.push After the game, Chrissy McKaigue thanked every man, woman and dog involved in their success. Everyone except Thomas Cassidy, who had passed away days before. He waited until the inner sanctum of a packed Slaughtneil hall later that night, when back among their own. The Four Seasons Cup was clasped by one victorious outstretched fist. The index finger on his other hand gestured to the hall floor scarcely visible below the throngs of fans, where Thomas taught him how to play hurling all those years ago. There wasnt a dry eye in the house. Even the walls wouldve had goosebumps. On the Monday night, his brothers Mark, Declan and Bungazed at Buzzers TV with a look and a body language that money couldnt buy. Slaughtneil were at the top of the tree. The new Ulster champions had many helping hands to shape them along the way. But the Cassidys fingerprints were always prominent. Taking over the mantle of the Kellys, who sowed the seeds in the s. googletag.cmd.push Mark and Declan seemed like eternal minor managers when, in the beginning, silverware didnt always reward their toil. On a monsoon afternoon at Kevin Lynch Park, a saturated Bun thumped the roof of the then prefab dressing rooms to the sound of campeones. A team he managed with former minor winner Eoin McGuigan, that included Cormac McKenna and Chrissy McKaigue, had brought home the bacon. It was another building block. Also seated for that Monday viewing was Dermot Doherty, a selector under Michael McShane who is now running his eye over the minors. The apple doesnt fall far from the tree. His father Barney and the late Eugene Babs Kelly managed the clubs  winning team. It was a fitting reward for Barneys ferrying of average underage teams, year after year, in the back of his blue Mercedes van. Often on the lookout for a th player to make up a team that would iniably be on the end of many a hammering. An U shield at a blitz in Dungiven and a South Derry minor hurling final win against Lavey were the modest s for the effort. A FIRST FEacuteILE Below it all, another batch was coming to the fore to cut new ground. In , under Thomas and Barney and captained by current minor selector Adrian Quigg, Slaughtneil won their first ever Feacuteile title. By minor level, with direction from Mark and Declan Cassidy, back to back Ulster minor titles followed, from a group that also won a football title at St Pauls and lost in the final the following year. A generation that also produced current senior football boss Paul Bradley. Under Thomas wing, they won the senior title in  before being beaten out the gate by Dunloy in the Ulster final. It couldve been the beginning of dominance, but instead it was a last senior title for  years as Kevin Lynchs and Lavey ruled the roost. Armed with more coaches coming forward, the Slaughtneil underage hurling production line succeeded Ballinascreens time at the top. No longer was the journey south to the Feacuteile a novelty. It was a permanent fixture in the calendar. With it, came families bonding together and each success inspired the younger teams to follow. A new wave of minor glory at Ballinascreens Ulster tournament followed, but Kevin Lynchs were still the standard at senior level.  was supposed to be the breakthrough year. After winning a league title, Slaughtneils young guns were the pretenders to the Fr Collins Cup only to be sent home with their tail between their legs again by the Lynchs.

He took trains from Milan to Torino, and then up the Susa Valley and around six hours later he was installed in Susa where it was  degrees.Race day dawned without a cloud in the sky and with the temperature already soaring, Hanna joined the front row of the grid designed for social distancing wearing his mask. The mask was obligatory for the first m. Hanna tucked into a front bunch that was a whorsquos who of Italian mountain racing. Hanna covered the first mile in :, and then at km the race became steep. He climbed well, as ever, encountering a dficult patch around the middle and then at about .km he spotted Baldaccini ahead of him, a past winner in  and .By now Hanna was in tenth place and with his climbing legs feeling good again set about moving up the field. He caught Baldaccini and kept pushing and on to the final k, with  flats and true flats at over , feet altitude, Hanna surged to cross the line in a brilliant eighth place.In the process he had taken the scalps of, not just the former winner of the race Baldaccini, but also Puppi, who had taken second place in last yearrsquos World Long-Distance Mountain Racing Championships, and Bernard Dematteis, the former European mountain racing champion.At Down Royal on Saturday, the sound of hi-tec racing flats reverberated around the horse racing turf as the ChampionChip Ireland Road Race Series continued following its event at Eikon, Balmoral, three weeks ago.It was only August , but could easily have been mistaken for late autumn as the blustery conditions from the remnants of tropical Storm Ellen continued to cause havoc in the quest for personal bests.It was a testament to the consistent running many had done during lockdown and throughout the winter before that there were many personal bests achieved.First up was the km, won by Mourne man Andrew Annett in : in a sprint finish with Annadalersquos Eskander Turki .

Phil Murdock broke the -minute barrier for the first time clocking :.Mark Holland has shown steady improvement in training and is another who is getting faster as he gets older, now in the M category. With a previous best of around  and a half minutes, he smashed that with a brilliant : clocking, a fine product for all the work he has done.Nichola Watson has had injury troubles, but over the past couple of months has been training consistently again.

At that stage, Bryansford had work to do with Clonduff leading - to -.Charlie Carr split the posts for Clonduff with a superbly taken score. Aidan Carr also got in on the act scoring a minor from play and Stephen McConville got his name on the scoresheet.Aidan Carr added another point and on  minutes the lead was extended further when Arthur McConville landed a big free to make it - to -.Bryansford needed something to steady the ship and they managed it on  minutes, getting their first score on the board when a free from Cathal Burns cut the gap to four points.Clonduff, however, were in no mood to get a case of the jitters and indeed stretched their lead to - to - when, in the th minute, firstly Tom Close got the better of his marker to break free to land another score, and then moments later, Barry OrsquoHagan did likewise.Bryansford were in need of some kind of encouragement and Danny Savage provided it on  minutes when he landed a free.Darren OrsquoHagan however went up the field and confidently steered between the posts to put Clonduff - to - ahead at the half-time interval.Early in the second period, Clonduff kept the foot on the gas to flatten the Bryansford spirit even more.Paddy Brannigan engineered just enough space for himself to punt the ball over Mark Reidrsquos crossbar.And then on  minutes it was - to - when Aidan Carr capitalised on space in the lsquoFord defence to leave Clonduff in the box seat.Clonduff were finding space more and more easy to come by and from a free after five minutes Stephen McConville made it - to -.Bryansford remained honest in the battle and made their third impression on the scoreboard when David McKenna pointed on  minutes.Clonduffrsquos machine was starting to purr productively and they rolled the scoreboard over once more ten minutes after the resumption when Stephen McConville knocked the ball over from play.The sides swapped scores on the -minute mark of the contest when David McKibbin made another minor from a free for lsquoFord, but Stephen McConville pointed for Clonduff to make it - to -.Fintan Canavan scored Bryansfordrsquos fth point before Stephen McConville responded in kind to again leave a nine-point cushion between them.The final minor before the next water break though went the way of Bryansford, Timmy Hanna notching it to make it - to -.In the th minute of the contest, Cathal Burns pointed Bryansfordrsquos seventh point.

Like Pantridge, after the war he could neither forgive nor forget and had a burning hatred of the Japanese.During his time in captivity, Pantridge suffered badly from malnutrition, beri beri and other illnesses. Following the Japanese surrender he weighed less than five stone and was a physical wreck.On ing home to Northern Ireland in October  he was still very weak, but was determined to resume his medical career, getting a housemanrsquos position at the Royal Victoria Hospital.Because of his experiences in the POW camps, he decided to specialise in heart medicine. He became a consultant physician and cardiologist at the RVH before inventing the portable defibrillator in the s.Pantridge had become convinced that a patient might be savedan electric shock was applied to the chest as soon as possible after a cardiac arrest. There were defibrillators in hospitals, but they were too big and bulky to be taken outside.Along with others he set out to make a defibrillator small enough to fit inside an ambulance. In  the first ambulance with a defibrillator was operating in Northern Ireland, making the province one of the safest places in the world to have a heart attack.The mobile defibrillator was used to treat US President Lyndon Johnson when he suffered a heart attack in .Although he was known worldwide as the lsquoFather of Emergency Medicinersquo Pantridge was less acclaimed in his own country, and was saddened that it took until  for all front-line ambulances in the UK to be fitted with defibrillators.He had retired in  and died on December , , aged . A bronze statue of him stands outside Lisburnrsquos civic centre as a timeless tribute to his achievements.Cecil Lowry says of Professor Pantridge: ldquoFrank was a man, whose talents and achievements were so extraordinary, that the further we consider his character, the more he will be remembered by the present generation with admiration and reverence.ldquoThis book has told the manrsquos story of incredible bravery in the face of overwhelming odds during the Second World War and his dedication to the concept of the portable defibrillator on his . He was part of the lsquoforgotten armyrsquo and more than  years on, with very few still alive, it is a privilege to set the record straight and to honour him.lsquoFrank Pantridge MC, Japanese Prisoner of War and Inventor of the Portable Defibrillatorrsquo is published by Pen  Sword Books Ltd and is priced pound...prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th August 2020 Dedicated.jpg","title":"Dedicated crossings for school children on Strangford ferry  ","story":"DEDICATED sailings for school children are to be introduced on the Strangford ferry service from next week.The Department for Infrastructure will provide a foot passenger only service from either side of the waterway from next Tuesday.Students will cross from Portaferry at .am and from Strangford at pm, with the sailings co-ordinated with Translink to ensure that there are buses to ferry children to and from school.Confirmation of the new service mdash which requires all passengers to wear face masks mdash comes after a number of children were refused permission to board the ferry on Monday morning from the Portaferry side.Only  foot passengers were permitted on the sailing due to coronavirus restrictions which forced children to wait for the vessel to , sparking criticism from Strangford MLA Kellie Armstrong and local councillor Joe Boyle.Mrs Armstrong, who for a number of weeks has highlighted the issue of limited passenger numbers and how students travelling on the ferry would be accommodated, has raised her concerns with Stormont education minister Peter Weir.She said that her fears were confirmed on Monday when only  foot passengers were permitted per sailing which resulted in some students having to miss two subsequent sailings before they could cross the lough, missing buses to Downpatrick.Mrs Armstrong said she was also concerned that children had to wait for up to one hour with little access to shelter, before yesterdayrsquos storm force conditions.ldquoSchoolsat the end of August every year and social distancing has been in place for months.ldquoAnyone with any transport planning ability would have ensured there was a solution, recognising the number needing to cross on the ferry as foot passengers and enabling students to travel safely, she said ahead of yesterdayrsquos confirmation about the new passenger service.ldquoI contacted the Minister for Infrastructure who confirmed weeks ago that her department was waiting on education officials to clary how many students needed to cross and sailing times.In a letter to Mr Weir, the Strangford MLA suggested that officials ldquofailed to meet the start of school deadline and as a result students were not being provided with appropriate home to school transport.Mrs Armstrong said that in the pastthe ferry could not be used, students were bused around the peninsula and asked why this option was not considered.Cllr Boyle said that what happened on Monday morning impacted on students who attend schools in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch.ldquoI simply cannot believe that as we entered the last week in August with Minister Weir trumpeting the importance of ato school that there was little or no advanced preparation or thought for children and parents within the Ards peninsula. The way they have been treated is diabolical, he declared.Cllr Boyle said parents have raised their concerns with him, highlighting what their children experienced at the start of the new school term by having to wait to use the ferry.He also revealed that he became increasingly concerned when he highlighted the issue on social media and was told how children were being treated.Cllr Boyle said problems were compounded with the closure of the main Strangford to Downpatrick road to allow a number of trees to be pruned to allow double decker buses to use the route in future.ldquoMy main concern is that there was no prior notice in relation to the number of children who could board the ferry.

The Minister cannot allow all this to simply be thrown away.The Strangford MLA added: ldquoThe local community previously stood together to save Exploris and will do so again. I would urge anyone with concerns to make their voice heard and lodge their concerns and together we can save our local economy.It is believed that the poundm aquarium proposal could create more than  full-time jobs and would be the biggest attraction of its kind on the island of Ireland.The firm behind it, reefLIVE, says around  to  jobs could be created during its construction, with  full-time

One of the bandrsquos members, Sam Gill, played at the end of Sundayrsquos service.Mr Telford described Sundayrsquos service as a ldquosad occasion as the congregation in Down Parish said goodbye to their minister who had touched all their lives.He said Mr McDonaldrsquos arrival in  ldquosparked renewed optimism within the church with the new man quickly making his mark, especially in relation to the Pepper Johns Community Centre which he helped deliver along with the board of trustees.He added: ldquoPerhaps the best tribute that can be paid to Scott is that he very soon became one of us and, deep down, I think he knows that he always will be. It was a hard decision for Scott and his family to make the move to Newry and it is important that while we are disappointed aboutthis, we support them and continue to do so.On behalf of Hollymount Church, Ms Blair said that Mr McDonald will be very much missed, praising him for his leadership and the ious initiatives that he spearheaded over the past four years.ldquoWe are all fond of Scott who was with us through thick and thin and ups and downs. No matter what, Scott was there, she said.Ms Blair added: ldquoWhile we are sorry to see him go, we wish Scott and his family all the best in Newry..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th August 2020 Students.jpg","title":"Students celebrate GCSE results after ‘challenging year’  ","story":"IT was a dferent GCSE results day this year for local schools and students as the need to maintain social distancing measures was a key concern.As with the recent A-Level results, grades this year were predicted by teachers as examinations could not be held due to schools closure over the Covid- lockdown.Down High Schoolrsquos principal, Mrs Maud Perry, reported that  students collected their results from two designated venues in Downpatrick at dferent times with social distancing measures in place.Nearly % of all students achieved at least seven A* A grades while six pupils mdash Katie Dickson, Ellen Johnston, Cameron McCaughey, Lauren McCormick, Rosa Morgan-Young and Anna Torrens mdash all received ten A* grades while Lucy Healy and Tori Marks secured nine A* grades each.Mrs Perry paid tribute to the hard work of her pupils during such challenging times.ldquoThis was a lovely year group and we congratulate them on these outcomes, which provide a firm foundation for the next stage of their education.

Mine are typically borne of the annual one- or two-week childhood summer holidays in the s - staying in a guesthouse, splashing in the sea, building sandcastles, baking in the sun and or sheltering from the rain, roundabout rides in Barry’s amusements - all sustained by a diet of fish and chips, ice-cream, fizzy pop and candy floss! Returning as a working journalist in later le entailed mental gymnastics to temporarily mask the myriad of memories and concentrate on the task in hand!I remember my parents and their adult friends making plans to go shopping in the White House though I’ve no recollection of going with them, and until this week I wasn’t even vaguely aware of the shop’s enormously colourful history.“The White House was opened by a local man, Henry Hamilton, in ,” began a reader’s note to Roamer, and continued intriguingly “the story goes that Henry left Portrush for America in , leaving his clothes at the edge of the River Bann to shamefully fake his own suicide and avoid debts.”I don’t knowthe reader’s thoughts turned to Portrush after reading last week’s page about Wing Commander Anthony Lovell, the town’s much-decorated WWII ace fighter pilot, recounted here by Hugh McGrattan and told in his book - Portrush: The Port on the Promontory - but the White House seems to be yet another remarkable tale less told. There’ll be more here about it in the near future, starting today with the next line in the reader’s letter: “Henry Hamilton became director of a publishing company in Calornia, before ing to Portrush  years later a wealthy man and marrying his former sweetheart.”The reader’s account is more or less correct - the White House was founded in  after Henry Hamilton faked his death due to debts and fled to America. He ed a number of years later to be with his childhood sweetheart, a Miss Allen, whom he married.His new we insisted they stay in Ireland and so the White House was born, initially a drapery business called Hamilton and Company.According to the reader’s account Henry invited the creditors he’d run away from to dinner and repaid his debts. He also called his new business the White House after a well-known building with a similar name in the USA, and to honour the friends and connections he’d made on the other side of the Atlantic. The White House quickly became a successful commercial enterprise due to Hamilton’s business expertise, management skills and marketing talents. Far ahead of his time, he organised a mail order service and instigated eye-catching window displays and advertising campaigns. The mail order service became so popular that a new Post Office was opened in Portrush in !The White House attracted the highest calibre of clientele, with no less than Queen Victoria ordering her linens from the Portrush store.According to its website, the White House’s tailoring department in the early s also proved very popular with the Prince of Wales and with other royalty and high-society customers like His Highness the Raja of Pudukkottai from India. As yet I’m not sure of the exact dates, or which Prince of Wales used the shop’s tailoring department, but apparently the Raja of Pudukkottai once made an order for  suits which was the White House’s biggest ever transaction at the time.Nor do I know how to properly spell or pronounce Pudukkottaibut the Raja’s aforementioned administrative district was in the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu and its ruler’s full name was Raja Sri Brahdamba Dasa Raja Sir Martanda Bhairava Tondaiman. Along with the town, the store’s popularity flourished, aided by the railway, sea travel, better roads and burgeoning visitor facilities. A beautul ‘terrazzo floored’ arcade took centre stage, with a state-of-the-art, electric passenger lt inside which was still in use up until a few years agoDuring the s and s the store became popular with American GI’s during WWII, who spent their leisure time in Portrush away from their bases in Londonderry. They loved to visit the White House buying gts to send home to their families.During the s and s the store expanded and continued to flourish with customers not only coming from Northern Ireland but also from England, Wales and Scotland, brought in by tour companies.The business was taken over by John Moore in , and an up-market boutique was launched, targeting the fashion conscious shopper and attracting new and younger customers.In the s major building works were completed which transformed the premises into a modern establishment with the official re-opening to the public taking place in . Ownership of the White House, with pride of place on Portrush’s Main Street, remains within the Moore family who are currently going through their archives to share more seaside shopping nostalgia here in the near future.

a cheatit had been suitable.ldquoBack in  there were a few areas in Barry which were beginning to look a little tired, but it also came with a timeless charm that provided us with the perfect texture and feel that Dave and I had discussed.ldquoAdded to this was the welcome we were given by residents and, in particular, the support of the local council.ldquoPorthcawl was also a serious candidate for the backdrop to this show, but having scouted tirelessly the whole of Barry and Barry Island, I knew that this ticked every box.Mr Evans said Trinity Street was an instant favourite.ldquoI knew Gwenrsquos house was here, he said. ldquoThe terraced houses on a steep hill and its far-reaching views over to Barry Island and docks meant that no matter which direction the camera was pointing, there would be interesting textures and views.ldquoThe next objective was to get inside as many houses as possible to seeany worked for us as Gwenrsquos house.ldquoI letter dropped about  houses to gauge the interest.ldquoIrsquod heard that Matt Lucas was going to be involved so I used his name get to my foot in the door.ldquoThis usually helps.ldquoIn those days very few had heard of James Corden.ldquoI viewed and took pictures of about five houses on that street and Glendarsquos who was one of the first to contact me.ldquoThe decor and character of Glendarsquos house fitted my brief perfectly, but my first thought was that house was a little on the small side.ldquoTo get a film crew and the actors to work in such a tight space would be quite a challenge, butI could convince our director and designer that it could be achieved Gwenrsquos house was found.ldquoI took Dave and Christine along to Trinity Street and both fell in love with the location within minutes.Mr Evans continued: ldquoGlenda was so accommodating.ldquoI remember very well discussing with her the details of how filming on location works, how disruptive the whole process can be and also the location fee.ldquoWhat I do remember was her reaction when I mentioned the amount.ldquoGlendarsquos reply was: ldquoIrsquom so sorry Clive, but I donrsquot think I can cover that.ldquoGlenda thought that she needed to pay for the privilege of having us there and not the other way round.ldquoShe is a lovely lady and still loves being a part of the Gavin  Stacey world.During the locationsrsquo breakdown meeting, we discussed how Pam and Mickrsquos house might look in Billericay so homes were viewed in and around Llandaff and Sully until Dinas Powys was selected thanks to the welcome that was received.ldquoSt Cattwgrsquos Church at Llanmaes was not the first-choice wedding venue for Gavin and Stacey, Mr Evans said. ldquoThey were due to be married at St Nicholas Church at the village of St Nicholas, but a last-minute change of heart by the Church in Wales meant that we needed to find an alternative at the th hour.ldquoA friend and another locations manager called Chris Hill pulled in a favour and we were able to use St Cattwgrsquos.ldquoI dont recall any candidates other than Island Leisure .ldquoWhile filming on the front, Marco opening up early for the crew to be able to get a nice coffee as the weather was pretty unkind.ldquoWe didnt use the interior of the coffee shop as a location in series one, but as it was so cold when we filmed on the seafront the coffees were very welcome.ldquoWe also filmed at the Vale of Glamorgan Resort for the exterior of the wedding fair.ldquoThe interior was shot at the Copthorne Hotel at Culverhouse Cross.ldquoWhile at the Vale resort, the Wales rugby team came into the reception of the hotel.ldquoRuth Jones askedIrsquod be able to set up a photograph of the cast with the Welsh team.ldquoWe got them to agree so out there somewhere are pictures of the Gavin  Stacey cast with the Wales rugby team.ldquoUncle Brynrsquos house was only an exterior in series one so very little was involved in its search.ldquoQuiz night at the Colcot Arms was interesting.ldquoWe were close to completing our filming when the pub opened to the public - so the last few shots took a little while longer than wersquod planned.Mr Evans lives with his we Rhiannon and daughter Cerys Mim and runs his own Film and TV Facilities company.He added: ldquoThe actors usually donrsquot get to see the locations beforehand.ldquoThey are brought to set, run through a quick rehearsal then go for the real thing.ldquoThey then have to go through the whole thing over and over with the camera shooting from dferent angles.ldquoIt is a slow process and  hours on camera gives us around three minutes of footage.ldquoI get a real buzz from seeing locations that I have found on TV, but when it comes to Gavin  Stacey the story I always bring up is that while scouting in the very early days with the series producer in the car he askedI would consider reading for Dave.ldquoMy le could have been so dferent, but I have no regrets as no-one could have played it better than Steffan Rhodri.ldquoMy daughter Cerys Mim was born during filming and James Corden was the first to congratulate me when I ed to work on the show after her birth.ldquoHe joked about us naming her Nessa or Stacey.ldquoBarry and the Vale have always provided me with a fantastic hunting ground for film and TV locations.ldquoIts a huge contributor to South Wales becoming a hotspot for filming in the last decade or so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have checked and reading through the standing orders I don’t believe you had the authority to do what you did,you read the standing orders in the correct context.“In terms of the standing order it is for the reporting officer to determinea notice of motion is lawful or improper. The Chief Executive is our officer in that regard and he considered the motion and included it in the agenda for the meeting.“You then took the decision, unilaterally, to not have it heard during the meeting.”Councillor Causby asked for the matter to be investigated to clarythe Lord Mayor acted within the bounds of his authority.“My ask is that the Chief Executive and Council’s legal team investigate the eighth edition of’Knowles on Local Authority Meetings’ as it details the proper protocol, it is the guide and case law,” said the DUP representative.“I want to ensure that we get proper clarity to prevent a decision like from being taken again.”Speaking to the Local Democracy Reporting Service after the meeting, Councillor Causby said this call has nothing to do with the decision taken on the naming of the South Lakes Leisure Centre, rather ensuring that the office of the Lord Mayor remains removed from partisan politics.“With regards to the decision taken on the name of the leisure centre, what is done, is done,” said Cllr Causby.“We are not going to overturn that decision, it has already been made. I just want to ensure a moment like this does not happen again.“The standing order the Lord Mayor quoted is ... It concerns motions that are unlawful or improper. The Lord Mayor called the motion improper but that was not his call to make.“Council Baxter should have been informed of the decision prior to the meeting but he was not, nor was the Chief Executive, the Lord Mayor told us on the night he had informed his party colleagues.“He acted outside the process, outside standing orders and, in my view, quite improperly.”When asked about the process of the investigation, a Council spokesperson said “no comment could be made on the matter”.“In line with legislation, a notice of motion is subject to a call-in periodand no comment can be made on the matter until the call-in period has lapsed,” the spokesperson said.“In this case, as legal advice on the interpretation of the standing order is to be provided, it would also be subject to legal privilege.”Read our coverage of the original debate hereA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Over my years as principal, we have had great support from the club and some of our past pupils have gone on to represent their county.For me, the notable achievement has been to see the way in which past pupils have progressed in a iety of chosen careers and been successful in so many walks of le.Another achievement is the way in which the staff both past and present have worked together as a team to have accomplished so many things over the past  years, not least to have been awarded Outstanding in our last inspection report.The development of the St. Cairealls Community Playschool on the school site has also brought me great joy over the past ten years to see it now as a successful pre-school provider with DENI status and funding for our local children.Having spent so many years of my le in St Cairealls P.S., it has become a second home and the staff and pupils a second family. Retiring for me brings mixed emotions. However , I am looking forward to having more time to spend with my family, my husband Kevin, our daughters Emer, Niamh and Fionnuala and their partners. Also our son Michael and his partner and my two precious grandsons Micheal and Braidan. Mrs McHugh concluded: I want to offer good wishes to the future of this very special school – St. Cairealls Primary School, Aghyaran and success and happiness to my successor, Mrs Michelle Ellis.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fdcdbeeaaeeaacdf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dfebfeaeaeebac   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1598431969897.jpg--post_primary_pupils_now_to_wear_face_coverings_in_corridors.jpg?159843197000","title":"post primary pupils now to wear face coverings in corridors ","story":"Education Minister Peter Weir has announced that guidance on face coverings will be updated to include wearing them in corridors of post-primary schools. This will come into effect on  August when schoolson a full-time basis. The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. “In relation to communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible. “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir said: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school. Parents should not send their children to schoolthey have any of the Covid- symptoms including: a high temperature a new, continuous cough a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.” The Department’s New School Day Guidance will be updated to reflect this recommendation.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fdcdbeeaaeeaacdf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dfebfeaeaeebac   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
