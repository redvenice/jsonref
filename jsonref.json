And a very healthy cringe it is, too, because it is when you hold up a mirror to the age that you are motivated to improve it.Or, at least, laugh in its face.Alan first turned up in 1991 with a small role in Armando Iannucci’s brilliant parody of current affairs broadcasting, On The Hour, on BBC Radio 4.He was a sports reporter with a nice line in patronising misogyny, utter disdain for the Paralympics, and a worrying obsession with ‘groin strain’ in his football changing-room interviews.He was, however, a hit. Before long, he had his own spoof chat-show on the same network, Knowing Me, Knowing You With Alan Partridge, named after his favourite band Abba (who also inspired the show’s catchphrase, Aha!)It not only showcased his incompetence, but provided lovely cameos of exactly the kind of guests on such shows.    Alan’s hallmark as an interviewer was that he was never really very interested in the people he metSteve Coogan is \u0027dating Melanie Sykes and spent a romantic...Steve Coogan\u0027s Alan Partridge insists he is back to save...Share this articleHis programmes always ended in some kind of offence or disaster, and since at the time I was presenting a real talk show — Midweek — on Radio 4, for quite a few weeks I made a point of ending with one of Partridge’s catchphrases: ‘ . . . And on that bombshell . . .’ until the joke wore thin. Which, I have to admit, it did rather sooner for the producer than for me.I just adored the Partridge character because many of the pitfalls he tumbled into in those spoof interviews — with pretentious artists, crabby old buffers, or the easily offended — were so very recognisable. They were similar to traps I was cautiously navigating round every week.He WAS a sharp reminder of the perils facing all live interviewers — especially the kind more thrilled by the fact that they’re on the air than by any of the subjects or people they cover.Alan’s hallmark as an interviewer was that he was never really very interested in the people he met.Ultimately, Radio 4 was too small and respectable a platform for our Alan, and his co-writers — Iannucci, Peter Baynham, later Neil and Rob Gibbons — over successive years recognised he had to grow: ever more monstrous, more self-important, precariously successful, disaster-prone and deluded.Eventually, there was even an autobiography, I, Partridge: We Need To Talk About Alan, which is a far better read than that of most real media figures.It takes him through the whole arc from his radio beginnings to that brief TV stardom — Knowing Me, Knowing You transferred to television in 1994 — and on to disaster, exile, minor local radio jobs and corporate videos.Never truly defeated, though, even at his lowest he’s boasting of ‘projects on the boil with 24 broadcasters around the world . . . although the exact level of commitment from these channels was hard to gauge, they had at least taken my calls . . .’That book, which I read and re-read, chronicles the TV shows we all remember. In Knowing Me, Knowing You, which ran for six episodes, he displayed his limitless ability to ramp up disasters of his own making, including quarrelling violently with his studio bandleader Glen Ponder and accidentally shooting a guest dead.He eventually fouls up in the world’s naffest Christmas Special, Knowing Me Knowing Yule when he punches a wheelchair-bound athlete, fails to realise his cookery guest is a man in drag and disastrously pitches for a new series while interviewing live the ‘Chief Commissioning Editor’ of the BBC, Tony Hayers. His television career is over.However, Hayers — played by David Schneider — reappears in a wonderful series of mockumentaries, I’m Alan Partridge, in which Alan is reduced to living in a Travel Tavern and presenting on Radio Norwich in the small hours.The all-powerful executive features in the troubled Partridge’s fantasy yearnings to get back on the small screen.Aways sexually uncertain (his wife understandably ran off with her fitness instructor), Alan has dreams where he is a lap-dancer gyrating before the commissioner, offering his services in bondage leatherwear.By day, the exiled Alan fights for meetings at the BBC and invents format pitches to try to get back on: ‘Monkey tennis . . . Ladyshapes with Alan Partridge . . . Arm wrestling with Chas \u0026amp Dave . . . Inner City Sumo, very cheap to make, you could do it in a pub car park . . .’Actually, when BBC3 has done Snog Marry Avoid, and Hotter Than My Daughter, it seems surprising nobody in this desperate age of viewing has picked up any of Partridge’s ideas. But that’s the pleasure Partridge brings: he is the ultimate media wannabe.Through the various series that followed (including the marvellously dreary YouTube and Sky ‘phone-in’ Mid Morning Matters on North Norfolk Digital, another spoof documentary on the British class ide, and a travel programme) he reflects the trashy emptiness of so much of our cheap 24-hour broadcasting.From glitzy personality chat-shows to the wittering DJs and pointless phone competitions, Alan shows us that it is all part of the same spectrum.At the heart of it all is a monstrous inidual: a puffed-up egotist so incapable of any real relationship that his son (called Fernando — in another nod to Abba — obviously) doesn’t even invite him to his wedding.When his old commissioning editor dies, he attends the funeral, but roams about trying to borrow phone chargers and is already pitching to his successor.His politics are so witlessly to the fusty-Right that even the most conservative can wince his choices of ‘sports casual’ outfits make Nigel Farage look like Karl Lagerfeld.Coogan, a considerable actor, as we have seen in films Philomena and currently in Stan \u0026amp Ollie, inhabits the character of Partridge with almost frightening conviction, with all his mannerisms and style and mangled metaphors and defiant chippy insecurity.And like all good actors, he has no fear of looking terrible and being despised. Alan’s uneasy sense that he is ‘politically incorrect’ and out of step with modern times means that he has to snap, in a footnote to his foot-in-mouth remarks, ‘That’s not racist’ or ‘That isn’t sexism’.The joke should be over by now. Even the finest sitcom characters run out of steam: if they’re wise, like John Cleese as Basil Fawlty, they limit the run to leave us with a few classic episodes.But the brilliance of the Partridge brand, its performer and its writers is that, through the shows, books and the unexpectedly intelligent film Alpha Papa in 2013, he has developed, grown, shown us more and more of his desperation, history, background and convictions — without ever actually moving us far in the direction of compassion.That’s a clever trick: as one critic said: ‘He feels like a living, breathing person. But a living, breathing person that you want to strangle.’And we believe in him and his neediness. When in Alpha Papa he accidentally falls out of a window during a siege which has made him newly important as a hostage, he struggles to get back in. Fame comes before everything for Alan — just as it does for the new generation of reality stars.The way we enjoy Alan Partridge tells rather more than is comfortable about modern Britain. His positioning in the class system —an unclassifiable middle-middle-middle — is clever: from ‘above’ you can look down on his cultural ignorance and cliche speech, but from his own level or from below it you can giggle at his pretentious blazer-badges and slicked-down hair.Nobody of any class, race or type needs to identify with him it isn’t like a parody chav or toff. Yet all of us probably have our little Partridge moments. Politicians certainly do in the Brexit era.Lapses into Partridge-ism are not as lovable as Tony Hancock moments, or as pathetically sweet as Laurel and Hardy pratfalls. But they’re real all right. This Time With Alan Partridge, is on tonight, 9.30pm, BBC1. "},{"url":null,"title":"Frozen fruit vegetables HEALTHIER higher levels Vitamin C study finds","story":"    We are always told that one of the best ways to stay healthy is to eat lots of fresh fruit and vegetables.But tests have shown the ‘fresh is best’ mantra may not be true after all – and that frozen or tinned fruit and vegetables are just as nutritious.Scientists examined vitamin C levels in raspberries, pineapples, sweetcorn, carrots and peas – and found little difference between fresh or frozen.In some cases, frozen varieties actually contained higher levels of the vitamin.Of all the samples, it was frozen raspberries and peas which had the highest levels, while fresh raspberries had the least.There was barely any difference between frozen and fresh pineapple for levels of the vitamin – but both had more than tinned. This was also the case with carrots.For sweetcorn, the fresh pack had the most but the tinned variety had more than the frozen.The reason for the results is that often fresh produce has been transported long distances and left sitting around in warehouses and on supermarket shelves for long periods. In some cases, apparently fresh apples and potatoes could have been harvested as long as a year previously and then held in low-oxygen fridges to effectively halt the ripening and spoiling process.Is this too much food for a six-year-old?

It was a private visit so there was no additional cost to the British taxpayer.She is already back at work, flying the flag for Britain on a high-profile official visit to Morocco, where she and the Duke will promote diplomatic relations, boost UK interests and support humanitarian causes.Just another week in the everyday story of royal folk? Hardly. As Princess Diana’s private secretary, I learned to recognise that the line between official and private travel is never just about the money. It’s a code that opens a Pandora’s box of unintended consequences.Rich people’s jets — in this case a Gulfstream reportedly paid for by George and Amal Clooney — always come with a bill attached, even if it’s not the kind you can pay with a Duchy of Cornwall credit card.Favours must be returned, obligations quickly multiply and pretty soon royal free-riders are handing over their most precious assets: credibility and dignity, if not, please God, their lives.The uproar created in some quarters by Meghan’s brief, but undeniably extravagant, Big Apple excursion could hardly have been greater if she had run naked down Broadway and burned a Union Jack in Times Square.But let’s keep a sense of proportion here. A high-profile former actress, she happens to have rich celebrity friends and, if they behave as rich celebrities usually do, then good luck to her, surely.Anyway, other members of the Royal Family, notably Prince Charles and Camilla, have often been known graciously to accept favours from the mega-rich, especially if there’s a jet, a yacht or a private island on offer. Just don’t tactlessly mention the environmental damage.This whole subject is a high-hypocrisy zone, so instead, relax, enjoy the exotic pictures and remember the words of Jimmy Stewart’s character, the cynical hack Macaulay Connor in The Philadelphia Story: ‘The prettiest sight in this fine pretty world is the privileged class enjoying its privileges.’Royal dramas of this kind tend to fizzle out pretty quickly, fit only for tomorrow’s recycling bin.There will surely be some courtiers this morning (not least in Casablanca with the Duke and Duchess) who are trying this explanation on for size. Perhaps it will all blow over, they hope, and the British public’s love for its excitingly-disruptive American newcomer will resume undiminished.After all, it seems only yesterday that Her Royal Highness was winning hearts with her ‘bananagrams’ for sex workers in Bristol, recipe-sharing with women in the Grenfell community kitchen, and speech-making on women’s education and women’s suffrage on a hugely successful tour Down Under in October.

Five nights in a one-bedroom suite at The Mark Hotel costs $9,982.05Yet the excesses of the baby shower now threaten the benign indifference of the British public — an accident of history that is the Windsors’ most precious, but also most volatile, asset. Unfortunately for Meghan, in Windsor World it doesn’t require wicked intent to set the centuries-old edifice a-tremble: not knowing what you don’t know will do the job just as well.In this context, it’s hard to remember Meghan’s eager determination to ‘hit the ground running’ in her new royal career and not compare it with her sister-in-law Catherine’s less exciting but, in retrospect, wiser intention ‘to learn the ropes’.All Meghan’s running has brought her, at private-jet velocity, to a lonely crossroads. It’s a stark choice between the path of celebrity versus the path of duty, service and sacrifice.Did she recognise this dilemma before Prince Harry slipped that engagement ring onto her finger? As a gifted, intelligent and worldly woman, the answer is, surely, of course she did. She will also know that in marrying the Queen’s grandson, she has allied her interests with the Windsors’ instinct to protect their dynasty at any cost.          Duchess of Sussex visits  the Hubb Community Kitchen, LondonMeghan’s crossroads is as old as monarchy itself. A whole tribe of gutsy royal women have been here before her. In the last 100 years, several have been the spine and heart of the British Monarchy.These include: Alexandra, who endured Edward VII’s serial philandering and pioneered a new style of compassionate royal work Mary, who steeled her husband in World War I and Elizabeth the Queen Mother who did the same in WWII and the present Elizabeth, whose reign will likely never be surpassed as the standard for service before self.The common factor was a recognition that royal privilege and perks have to be paid for, not by rich chums, but by a lifetime of service to the people whose bows, curtsies and taxes will always be willingly given in return. Better make that probably willingly.Other women also passed this way. In the present reign, there has been a high failure rate of church weddings of first-rank Royal Family members. Only three, out of seven, have escaped the orce courts.One of those statistics was Harry’s mother, whose experience has hopefully also been carefully studied by Meghan. In comparing the two women, differences quickly outnumber any similarities. Diana’s 16-year royal career was already consigned to history before she reached the age Meghan is now.Meghan is no teen virgin, but a orced, media-smart and ambitious celebrity, empowered by all the arsenal of right-on feminism. Her fate is emphatically in her own hands, as it should be.Recent lurid headlines will fade, hurried on their way by the imminent arrival of what will surely be the most photogenic of babies.But that crossroads will, I predict, obstinately remain.Patrick Jephson was equerry and private secretary to HRH The Princess of Wales 1988-96.

Instead, Meghan will take a ‘fluid’ approach to the child’s upbringing.The Duchess will choose gender-neutral colours such as grey for the child, whether it’s a girl or a boy, said the source – following the trend set by politically aware circles in her home state, California.                                                    The picture showed a gold-rimmed plate with a pale green baby rattle pop cake, a cupcake with a stencilled pram decoration and a biscuit in the shape of a stork carrying a baby.But The Mail on Sunday can today reveal that Meghan, radiant in a white-spotted navy blue maternity dress, had far more than designer biscuits to choose from.The groaning table, covered in a thick cream linen tablecloth, was anchored by a spectacular centrepiece of a huge glass vase containing 3ft high cherry blossom branches. Scattered arrangements of Meghan’s favourite pink peonies and delicate sweet peas completed the elegant look.In addition to the macaron towers, there was more drama in the cakes and confectionery thought to have been made by Michelin-starred chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten, whose eponymous restaurant at The Mark is considered one of the finest in New York. Meghan, 37, who is around seven-and-a-half months pregnant, is a self-confessed foodie and while guests including her former Suits co-star Abigail Spencer, Ms Mulroney, hairdresser Serge Normant and designer Misha Nonoo were serenaded by harpist Erin Hill, the food was the real star. Custom-made cakes including Key lime tarts, cherry tarts, red velvet cakes and carrot cakes, sat beside gold-embellished containers filled with sugar crystals into which stork-shaped biscuits had been artfully arranged.Health-conscious Meghan insisted on items being marked ‘gluten free’ for those with dietary constraints.There were also cotton candy pom poms (candy floss on sticks) – explaining the delivery of a candy floss machine to the hotel during a snow storm on the eve of the party – and a jar of multi-coloured ‘donut holes’ that were gluten-free and just 40 calories each. Sources said Ms Williams’ designer biscuits, including iced storks on lollipop sticks, trays of sweet bunnies with chocolate piping and biscuits in the shape of traditional English prams in blue icing, were a hit.The colour scheme featured multiple hues of blues, pinks, yellows and greens and gave no hint as to the gender of the future Baby Sussex. ‘It was a delicious palate of colours and a very sophisticated table,’ a source said.‘There was no dominant colour theme. It was just opulent, luxurious and completely over the top.’ Cupcakes topped with yellow and orange piped flowers (130 calories each) sat beside mini lemon meringue pies (325 calories) and pink meringues (100 calories).    The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are welcomed by officials on their arrival at Casablanca airport, for their tour of MoroccoThe four macaron towers sat on white royal icing bases and the banquet featured a spectacular white ‘pop cake’ pyramid decorated with hand-crafted pink paper flowers that, according to one observer, ‘looked almost too good to eat’.Drinks ranged from vintage champagne to designer teas and £12 bottles of water.The official baby shower cake was a two-tier white fondant confection decorated with paper figures of Meghan, Harry and a pram positioned in front of cut-out paper cherry blossom trees.     The official baby shower cake was a two-tier white fondant confection decorated with paper figures of Meghan, Harry and a pram positioned in front of cut-out paper cherry blossom treesWhile the cost of the five-day celebration, including Meghan’s one-bedroom, £15,312-a-night suite and her ride in George Clooney’s private jet was estimated at £350,000, the food alone may have cost up to £20,000.  Meghan, 37, is around seven-and-a-half months pregnant One Los Angeles-based private chef who works for A-list celebrities said: ‘If you look at the ingredients alone, then you’d probably be looking at two to three grand, but when you factor in The Mark hotel and Jean-Georges, then the sky is the limit. If I was to put a figure on an event like this, in a location like that, I’d say ten to 20 grand.’There have been suggestions that the New York bash was used by Meghan to wrest back control of her own image. It certainly drew huge media attention with scores of photographers camped behind barriers outside the hotel.The duchess arrived in New York on February 15. The following day she had dinner with Ms Williams, Ms Mulroney and close friend Markus Anderson.Guests arrived at the baby shower with gifts including a £326 Babyletto crib and a £470 Trek bicycle. Flowers were provided by a company called Lady Fleur and Meghan later donated the arrangements to charities. However, the fate of any left-over food is unknown. The LA chef said: ‘It’s doubtful that number of guests could possibly have consumed that amount of food.‘It would be nice to think that someone somewhere might be enjoying a rose-petal flavoured French macaron.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Meghan Markle need report gifts worth 15 000 baby shower IRS","story":"    Meghan Markle, the Duchess of Sussex, will have to report to the IRS any gifts whose value is in excess of $15,000 that she may have received during her baby showerBut the American-born British royal will still need to declare any and all presents whose value exceeds $15,000.The reason for this is the United States is one of the few countries in the world that taxes the income of its citizens who live abroad.This will create all sorts of headaches for Meghan and Harry, who have reportedly hired American tax experts to help them sift through the complex tax laws that require the couple to open up their books to the IRS.The IRS is known for being extremely strict in tracking down people they believe owe them money. The Duchess of Sussex is still an American citizen so has to pay tax in the U.S., and this could extend to anyone else she draws money from, including her husband.This could deplete both her $5million U.S. fortune and Prince Harry\u0027s main source of private wealth, a £300,000-a-year trust fund on which he pays UK income tax.

You can stereotype me as a blonde bimbo, but you’re going to be surprised when I start talking business.  "},{"url":null,"title":"I want inspire British girls not make mistakes","story":"    Shamima Begum pictured with her week old son in Al Hawl camp for captured ISIS wives\u0027She doesn\u0027t deserve to come back to Britain\u0027: Shamima...\u0027British women are hiding among us\u0027: ISIS women in refugee...Share this article    Market day in Al Hawl camp. Shamima has given several interviews, but I am the first journalist she has invited inside the tent she calls homeI have come to see the most famous jihadi bride of all, Shamima Begum, the teenager from East London, but I am not allowed to visit this part of the camp without a security guard armed with an AK-47 assault rifle.Since she was discovered here earlier this month, nine months’ pregnant and having fled IS’s final showdown, Shamima has given several interviews, but I am the first journalist she has invited inside the tent she calls home.She sits crossed-legged on a thin black mattress in her socks, her week-old son, Jerah, on her lap. The child is named after a 7th century Islamic warlord.Shamima tells me she has been given the tent because she is ‘famous now’.Removing her headscarf she explains politely that she is sorry she cannot offer me tea because she has no means of heating water.At just 19, she has been living in a war zone since the age of 15. She has given birth three times and lost two children: a toddler daughter died a few weeks ago and she lost her other son at eight-months-old last year. Her husband is in jail.          Shamima  told the Mail if allowed back into Britain she would dedicate herself to stopping other girls being radicalised           I find Shamima at pains to be conciliatory. She finally seems to understand the offence she has caused and the damage it has done to her prospects of returning home (pictured: Market day in Al Hawl camp)Her own family in Britain have said they are appalled at some of the things she has said and at the weekend her father condemned her lack of remorse for what IS has done.Today I find Shamima at pains to be conciliatory. She finally seems to understand the offence she has caused and the damage it has done to her prospects of returning home.‘I am hoping to be given a second chance’, she says quietly.‘I’d like to be an example of how someone can change. I want to help, encourage other young British people to think before they make life- changing decisions like this and not to make the same mistake as me.‘I can’t do that if I am sitting here in a camp. I can’t do that for you.’Cynics may question her sincerity and she clings to the belief that she is a victim in all of this, rather than someone who chose to leave her home and join a terror group.‘I feel like I’ve been discriminated against because everyone was saying I was a poster girl for ISIS,’ she says of the decision to strip her of her passport. ‘I’m being made an example of. I’m being punished right now because I’m famous.’And she questions why scores of other jihadi wives and their children have been allowed back to the UK after travelling to Syria to join IS.It is claimed that about 425 British IS members, men, women and children, have so far returned to the UK, the highest tally in Europe.She admits she is scared, not least because her recent ‘fame’ had angered a lot of the other jihadi wives in the camp.‘Now a lot of women hate me, I’m afraid of a lot of people,’ she says.Possibly with good cause. I have been told by others here that her recent interviews – in which she exposed her face on TV – have angered the more hardline IS women in the camp. There has been ‘talk’ of her tent being burned down.           Some recent arrivals from the Deir ez-Zor countryside have to sleep outside before tents become available. Dozens of babies have died in the cold already this winterThe sprawling camp is home to up to 40,000 refugees from Syria’s war zones who are looked after by the International Red Cross and various non-governmental organisations. Conditions are desperate.Some recent arrivals from the Deir ez-Zor countryside have to sleep outside before tents become available. Dozens of babies have died in the cold already this winter.Now it is midday, the sun is shining and inside the tent it is stiflingly warm. But Shamima won’t open the flap to let air circulate in case they are spotted without their headscarves.The women in the ‘Daeshi’ area of the camp – Daesh is the Arabic term used by its detractors to describe IS – are enclosed by barbed wire fencing and are not permitted to go outside its perimeter.There are hundreds of fanatical IS families here on this side of the barbed wire fence, recently arrived from the battlefield in and around the village of Baghouz where the group is making its last stand.Among them are as many as a dozen Britons, but most are going to painstaking lengths not to be identified.          Among them are as many as a dozen Britons, but most are going to painstaking lengths not to be identifiedFood is brought by women from the refugee side, where it is then sold to those ‘Daeshi’ families who have smuggled money out of their terror group’s crumbling remains.The others rely on handouts from non-governmental organisations, the Kurdish authorities, and the International Red Cross.Shamima coughs and says, although is it is mild today, she is sick from the cold. She is fortunate to have a tent but there is no oil burning stove for cooking.She says she is ‘stressed’ from the lack of sleep as she nurses her gurgling son, who is wearing a white and blue fleece baby grow – donated to her by another mother in camp.          Shamima made it known on arrival that she would like to marry an English-speaking fighter aged between 20 and 25 years oldAs we sit there crossed-legged chatting, she starts to open up about what life was like under IS.She handed over her British passport willingly when she arrived in Syria with two school friends in February 2015.‘They took my passport but I thought to myself ‘‘what am I going to do with it? I don’t really have any use for it’’,’ she says.She never expected to go back. Her future, the future she wanted, was as a housewife in the caliphate.Ten days after arriving in Raqqa, she was taken to a room to meet Yago Riedijk, a 23-year-old Dutch convert to Islam. It was the moment she had been waiting for.          She never expected to go back. Her future, the future she wanted, was as a housewife in the caliphateShe made it known on arrival that she would like to marry an English-speaking fighter aged between 20 and 25 years old. Riedijk, who changed his name to Abu Zoraya was, she says, just her type.‘When I first saw him, I was like ‘‘OK, yeah, he is good looking’’,’ she giggles, momentarily the giddy teenager. She even had a piece of paper in her pocket with a list of questions for him.‘I took out the paper, that’s what women do, you have to ask your questions. He was straight up and he was truthful with me.’Her first question was: What do you expect from me?‘He told me that he was strict and he wanted a good housewife that stays inside. He didn’t want someone who is Westernised and wants to always go out and stuff’,’ she said.Her next question: Are you a fighter?‘He said he was injured still and he was still recovering but he was planning to go fight again soon,’ she said. A few more questions and that was that. ‘I said yes, and he said yes.’She had got what she came for. A husband who was fighting for IS and a ‘normal’ life.          Shamima Begum in the Al Hawl camp in Kurdish Syria‘I went to ISIS thinking I would have a normal life but it turned out not to be true. I just got tricked, I guess,’ she says ruefully.Outside there is shouting: a three-year-old boy has just aimed a makeshift catapult filled with stones at a toddler’s head from less than three feet away.Our photographer Jamie Wiseman, who is waiting outside the tent, is forced to intervene.Shamima loves her husband Riedijk, a convicted terrorist who police believe was part of a cell plotting an atrocity in Europe, but she’s delusional about the prospect of a future with him.‘I hope for him to see his only surviving child. He loved his children a lot, when I lost them I think it had a bigger effect on him than me,’ she says.‘If he does get sent back to his own country, he will do his time there in his own country… (I will) wait for him. I am still married to him.’ We discuss the political situation and Home Secretary Sajid Javid’s suggestion that he might consider IS children being brought back without their mothers.According to estimates by The Soufan Centre, a thinktank on global security issues, up to 100 children could have been born to British jihadi wives in Syria and Iraq.It is believed that some 150 British girls and women have travelled to join IS, and almost all have married and given birth.    The sprawling Al Hawl refugee camp which contains a secure area for captured ISIS wivesSuddenly, for the first time, she shows some emotion and bursts into tears. ‘How can you ask a mother to separate herself from her son, especially after everything I have lost? This boy is all I have.’What she most misses about Britain, she says, is ‘the feeling of being safe and secure, not having planes flying over me, not having to randomly move in the middle of the night’.For now Shamima and her baby son must stay put in their little tent until their fate is decided.She shares it with Dura Ahmed, 28, a Canadian mother who tries to appease her own tearful child with a chocolate biscuit. There are a couple of rucksacks, some bread, a tub of cheese spread and some jerry cans filled with water.In Shamima’s corner is a pair of neon blue fake Nike trainers. She bought them for just over $4 (£3) a few days ago. They were the few dollar notes she has left.It is time for me to leave, promising to come back with news of the outside world. ‘Inshalla (God willing) I’ll see you soon,’ I tell her."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/02/14/17/058D0E19000007D0-0-image-a-10_1550163914652.jpg","title":"Entire family including FIVE children detailed inflatable boat abandoned Kent beach","story":"    The small rigid inflatable boat was seen bobbing in the water just after 7am on Sunday at St Margaret\u0027s Bay, around 2.5 miles from the Port of Dover in east KentThe family group were found by police on the shore and have been transferred to immigration officials for interview.A Border Force vessel  has been launched earlier today after an empty boat was spotted floating three hours later, just after 7am at St Margaret\u0027s Bay, around 2.5 miles from the Port of Dover in east Kent. A number of lifejackets were also found near the Shakespeare Beach, just over five miles from St Margaret\u0027s Bay. It ha snot been officially confirmed at this stage if they are linked.A Home Office spokesman said today Border Force are confident the vessel was used for a migrant crossing.He added: \u0027Border Force responded to an incident in Kingsdown, Kent, following reports of a boat in the channel.

And a very healthy cringe it is, too, because it is when you hold up a mirror to the age that you are motivated to improve it.Or, at least, laugh in its face.Alan first turned up in 1991 with a small role in Armando Iannucci’s brilliant parody of current affairs broadcasting, On The Hour, on BBC Radio 4.He was a sports reporter with a nice line in patronising misogyny, utter disdain for the Paralympics, and a worrying obsession with ‘groin strain’ in his football changing-room interviews.He was, however, a hit. Before long, he had his own spoof chat-show on the same network, Knowing Me, Knowing You With Alan Partridge, named after his favourite band Abba (who also inspired the show’s catchphrase, Aha!)It not only showcased his incompetence, but provided lovely cameos of exactly the kind of guests on such shows.    Alan’s hallmark as an interviewer was that he was never really very interested in the people he metSteve Coogan is \u0027dating Melanie Sykes and spent a romantic...Steve Coogan\u0027s Alan Partridge insists he is back to save...Share this articleHis programmes always ended in some kind of offence or disaster, and since at the time I was presenting a real talk show — Midweek — on Radio 4, for quite a few weeks I made a point of ending with one of Partridge’s catchphrases: ‘ . . . And on that bombshell . . .’ until the joke wore thin. Which, I have to admit, it did rather sooner for the producer than for me.I just adored the Partridge character because many of the pitfalls he tumbled into in those spoof interviews — with pretentious artists, crabby old buffers, or the easily offended — were so very recognisable. They were similar to traps I was cautiously navigating round every week.He WAS a sharp reminder of the perils facing all live interviewers — especially the kind more thrilled by the fact that they’re on the air than by any of the subjects or people they cover.Alan’s hallmark as an interviewer was that he was never really very interested in the people he met.Ultimately, Radio 4 was too small and respectable a platform for our Alan, and his co-writers — Iannucci, Peter Baynham, later Neil and Rob Gibbons — over successive years recognised he had to grow: ever more monstrous, more self-important, precariously successful, disaster-prone and deluded.Eventually, there was even an autobiography, I, Partridge: We Need To Talk About Alan, which is a far better read than that of most real media figures.It takes him through the whole arc from his radio beginnings to that brief TV stardom — Knowing Me, Knowing You transferred to television in 1994 — and on to disaster, exile, minor local radio jobs and corporate videos.Never truly defeated, though, even at his lowest he’s boasting of ‘projects on the boil with 24 broadcasters around the world . . . although the exact level of commitment from these channels was hard to gauge, they had at least taken my calls . . .’That book, which I read and re-read, chronicles the TV shows we all remember. In Knowing Me, Knowing You, which ran for six episodes, he displayed his limitless ability to ramp up disasters of his own making, including quarrelling violently with his studio bandleader Glen Ponder and accidentally shooting a guest dead.He eventually fouls up in the world’s naffest Christmas Special, Knowing Me Knowing Yule when he punches a wheelchair-bound athlete, fails to realise his cookery guest is a man in drag and disastrously pitches for a new series while interviewing live the ‘Chief Commissioning Editor’ of the BBC, Tony Hayers. His television career is over.However, Hayers — played by David Schneider — reappears in a wonderful series of mockumentaries, I’m Alan Partridge, in which Alan is reduced to living in a Travel Tavern and presenting on Radio Norwich in the small hours.The all-powerful executive features in the troubled Partridge’s fantasy yearnings to get back on the small screen.Aways sexually uncertain (his wife understandably ran off with her fitness instructor), Alan has dreams where he is a lap-dancer gyrating before the commissioner, offering his services in bondage leatherwear.By day, the exiled Alan fights for meetings at the BBC and invents format pitches to try to get back on: ‘Monkey tennis . . . Ladyshapes with Alan Partridge . . . Arm wrestling with Chas \u0026amp Dave . . . Inner City Sumo, very cheap to make, you could do it in a pub car park . . .’Actually, when BBC3 has done Snog Marry Avoid, and Hotter Than My Daughter, it seems surprising nobody in this desperate age of viewing has picked up any of Partridge’s ideas. But that’s the pleasure Partridge brings: he is the ultimate media wannabe.Through the various series that followed (including the marvellously dreary YouTube and Sky ‘phone-in’ Mid Morning Matters on North Norfolk Digital, another spoof documentary on the British class ide, and a travel programme) he reflects the trashy emptiness of so much of our cheap 24-hour broadcasting.From glitzy personality chat-shows to the wittering DJs and pointless phone competitions, Alan shows us that it is all part of the same spectrum.At the heart of it all is a monstrous inidual: a puffed-up egotist so incapable of any real relationship that his son (called Fernando — in another nod to Abba — obviously) doesn’t even invite him to his wedding.When his old commissioning editor dies, he attends the funeral, but roams about trying to borrow phone chargers and is already pitching to his successor.His politics are so witlessly to the fusty-Right that even the most conservative can wince his choices of ‘sports casual’ outfits make Nigel Farage look like Karl Lagerfeld.Coogan, a considerable actor, as we have seen in films Philomena and currently in Stan \u0026amp Ollie, inhabits the character of Partridge with almost frightening conviction, with all his mannerisms and style and mangled metaphors and defiant chippy insecurity.And like all good actors, he has no fear of looking terrible and being despised. Alan’s uneasy sense that he is ‘politically incorrect’ and out of step with modern times means that he has to snap, in a footnote to his foot-in-mouth remarks, ‘That’s not racist’ or ‘That isn’t sexism’.The joke should be over by now. Even the finest sitcom characters run out of steam: if they’re wise, like John Cleese as Basil Fawlty, they limit the run to leave us with a few classic episodes.But the brilliance of the Partridge brand, its performer and its writers is that, through the shows, books and the unexpectedly intelligent film Alpha Papa in 2013, he has developed, grown, shown us more and more of his desperation, history, background and convictions — without ever actually moving us far in the direction of compassion.That’s a clever trick: as one critic said: ‘He feels like a living, breathing person. But a living, breathing person that you want to strangle.’And we believe in him and his neediness. When in Alpha Papa he accidentally falls out of a window during a siege which has made him newly important as a hostage, he struggles to get back in. Fame comes before everything for Alan — just as it does for the new generation of reality stars.The way we enjoy Alan Partridge tells rather more than is comfortable about modern Britain. His positioning in the class system —an unclassifiable middle-middle-middle — is clever: from ‘above’ you can look down on his cultural ignorance and cliche speech, but from his own level or from below it you can giggle at his pretentious blazer-badges and slicked-down hair.Nobody of any class, race or type needs to identify with him it isn’t like a parody chav or toff. Yet all of us probably have our little Partridge moments. Politicians certainly do in the Brexit era.Lapses into Partridge-ism are not as lovable as Tony Hancock moments, or as pathetically sweet as Laurel and Hardy pratfalls. But they’re real all right. This Time With Alan Partridge, is on tonight, 9.30pm, BBC1. "},{"url":null,"title":"Frozen fruit vegetables HEALTHIER higher levels Vitamin C study finds","story":"    We are always told that one of the best ways to stay healthy is to eat lots of fresh fruit and vegetables.But tests have shown the ‘fresh is best’ mantra may not be true after all – and that frozen or tinned fruit and vegetables are just as nutritious.Scientists examined vitamin C levels in raspberries, pineapples, sweetcorn, carrots and peas – and found little difference between fresh or frozen.In some cases, frozen varieties actually contained higher levels of the vitamin.Of all the samples, it was frozen raspberries and peas which had the highest levels, while fresh raspberries had the least.There was barely any difference between frozen and fresh pineapple for levels of the vitamin – but both had more than tinned. This was also the case with carrots.For sweetcorn, the fresh pack had the most but the tinned variety had more than the frozen.The reason for the results is that often fresh produce has been transported long distances and left sitting around in warehouses and on supermarket shelves for long periods.

An amendment tabled by Labour\u0027s Yvette Cooper and Tory former minister Oliver Letwin - to be put to a vote on Wednesday - would force Mrs May to seek an extension if a deal has not been approved by MPs by March 13.Ms Cooper, a former Labour minister, said on Monday it would allow Parliament to tell the Prime Minister to seek an extension to the negotiation process but leave it in the Government\u0027s hands to decide how long it should be.But Mrs May could seek to take matters into her own hands and decide to set a short, fixed extension herself, the Telegraph reported.This could theoretically see off a rebellion by Remain-supporting MPs and ministers who are threatening to back Cooper-Letwin.Defence minister Tobias Ellwood suggested there was a possibility of Theresa May herself announcing an extension of the two-year Article 50 negotiation process beyond March 29.Mr Ellwood told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today: \u0027The Prime Minister is listening and is recognising the fact that we have tried very, very hard in order to secure a deal.\u0027Go long The EU is said to favour a longer delay, possibly up to 21 months.Plans being considered in Brussels would see the transition period due to follow on if the UK leaves with a deal replaced by staying in the EU proper, the Guardian reported. This would allow for deeper talks on the future relationship between Britain and the EU, with the aim of making the Irish border backstop - the main sticking point in the drawn-out negotiations - redundant.The possibility of extending Article 50 was raised when May met with German chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday in Egypt. Nuclear option: Britain could unilaterally reverse Article 50 and stay in the EU until the deal is done. A European court ruled last year that this can be done by the UK without seeking consent from other EU states, whereas extending the Article 50 period would require agreement from the other 27 capitals. But it would also be likely to see Brexiteers in Mrs May\u0027s party explode with rage and could speed up her demise.                            Mrs May met European Union Council President Donald Tusk, right, on the sidelines of the summit yesterday          Prime Minister Theresa May is hugged by the Prime Minister of Bulgaria Boyko BorissovBut she refused to criticise the rebel trio and ducked questions about whether the fragile state of her Government made the ministers \u0027unsackable\u0027.Mrs May said: \u0027Collective responsibility has not broken down. What we\u0027ve seen around the Cabinet table, in the party, in the country at large is strong views on the issue of Europe. That\u0027s not a surprise to anybody.\u0027We have around the Cabinet table a collective, not just responsibility, but desire to actually ensure we leave the EU with a deal. That\u0027s what we\u0027re working for, that\u0027s what I\u0027m working for.\u0027We\u0027ve been having positive talks with the EU. As you know we were in Brussels last week, my team will be back in Brussels again this coming week. They will be returning to Brussels this Tuesday.

And that\u0027s what we\u0027re working to do.\u0027Mrs May is holding talks with Angela Merkel today in the hope the German chancellor can break the deadlock in Brussels.Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith last night said that by delaying the meaningful vote, Mrs May was effectively \u0027calling the bluff\u0027 of the Cabinet rebels.\u0027They are smashing the whole concept of government,\u0027 he said.

The leadership has so lost trust but I don\u0027t believe any of the figures they come out with on the cases they\u0027ve dealt with. I\u0027ve had pretty horrific abuse on Twitter. It absolutely doesn\u0027t feel to me like there is zero tolerance on anti-Semitism.\u0027 Dame Louise said: \u0027I am still fighting with the party\u0027s failure to deal with anti-Semitism.\u0027An unpublished Labour Party report into Dame Louise\u0027s Liverpool Riverside constituency found she was physically threatened by one member and \u0027there have been CLP meetings during which anti-Semitic incidents are alleged to have taken place\u0027.The report said: \u0027These have arisen as a result of \u0027obsessive interrogations\u0027 of the MP over the Israel-Palestine conflict. Some members have felt that others are holding the MP – a Jewish woman – personally accountable for the actions of the Israeli government.\u0027The 11 members of the Independent Group will meet today to discuss organisation, including how to elect a leader. Yesterday Chuka Umunna called on voters to \u0027join us, and help us forge a new, different kind of politics\u0027.A poll for The Observer puts the group\u0027s support at 6 per cent, ahead of the Lib Dems. It has also emerged that Sir David Garrard, once one of Labour\u0027s biggest donors, is supporting the new group.                         Tom Watson said Mr Corbyn had to \u0027change very, very rapidly\u0027 to stop more MPs from following the nine who quit the party last week.He also revealed he had handed the party leader a dossier of 50 cases where no adequate action had been taken over racist comments on social media about Jewish iniduals.In a TV interview, he demanded Mr Corbyn take personal charge of rooting out anti-Semitism because the \u0027party machine\u0027 had failed. And he urged him to change tack on Brexit and push for a second referendum.\u0027The departure of our colleagues is a real blow, and we need to understand why they felt the need to go. Because if we\u0027re going to be in government we need to address those concerns.\u0027For us to hold this party together, things have to change. There\u0027s almost a crisis for the soul of the Labour Party now. I absolutely fear that we will lose more parliamentary colleagues. We may lose peers from the House of Lords, and we may lose members and councillors and I don\u0027t want that to happen.\u0027Mr Watson said Luciana Berger, the Liverpool Wavertree MP who left for the Independent Group last week, had been \u0027bullied out of the Labour Party by a small number of racist thugs\u0027 and he was \u0027very very sad to see her go\u0027.Hard-Left activists, he said, were causing irreparable harm by \u0027pouncing\u0027 on MPs, and bullying them on social media. Details of the anti-Semitism dossier, seen by the Mail, show it included vicious racist abuse. One said of Jewish Labour MPs: \u0027I don\u0027t know what runs through their veins, not human blood.\u0027Mr Watson said Labour general secretary Jenny Formby\u0027s attempts to combat anti-Semitism had \u0027very patently not been adequate\u0027 and Mr Corbyn should take a personal lead.On Brexit, he said Mr Corbyn needed to \u0027reunify our party\u0027 and move towards a second referendum.He also called for more centrist Labour MPs to be given jobs on the front bench and said he was going to set up a new \u0027social democratic\u0027 group of moderates to develop policies. In an interview with Sky News on Friday night, Mr Corbyn said he did not believe bullying existed in Labour on a wide scale.When confronted with quotes from prominent Jews accusing him of not doing enough, he said there were \u0027very many other people in the Jewish community\u0027 who were happy.A Labour Party spokesman said: \u0027The Labour Party takes all complaints of anti-Semitism extremely seriously and we are committed to challenging and campaigning against it in all its forms. All complaints about anti-Semitism are investigated in line with our rules.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/02/25/09/06B5DE35000003E8-6742033-image-a-17_1551087202350.jpg","title":"Kate splashes half term treat Duchess takes George Charlotte swimming","story":"    The Duchess of Cambridge took Prince George and Princess Charlotte (pictured with their mother at Beaufort Park) for a swim  Her youngest child, Prince Louis, was seemingly left at home either with her husband, Prince William, or their nanny.Wearing a maroon swimsuit, she tried to blend in amongst relaxing couples but onlookers quickly spotted the family during their half-hour splash about.           The royals have been enjoying a half-term break at Anmer Hall (pictured) on the Sandringham Estate in Norfolk Kate\u0027s last-ditch Christmas shopping trip with the children...Gayle King reveals Meghan Markle and baby shower guests made...Share this articleKate, 37, apparently organised swimming races for the children and afterwards they practised little es off the side. The royal trio then all went into the sauna and steam room. One onlooker told the Mail: ‘Kate looked stunning.

Creating a positive atmosphere where students can share skills and help each other boosts their creativity and confidence – and helps them get great new ideas as well. So it’s no surprise that having seen their students thrive, teachers across the UK are following suit: they’re embracing social learning to develop their professional skills and networks.“I feel that there’s been a real shift in thinking in this area,” says Paul Morgan, business development manager at CER Education Recruitment. “We recently contributed to a #WomenEd event, for example, a network created to connect, inspire, develop, promote and give confidence to the next generation of women leaders in education.“When we’ve been out speaking to teachers and network leaders, we found that many people thought they were the only ones who had been in their particular situation before. They had never before had a sounding board – a network of people either online or in real life. Now, there’s always somewhere you can go to ask for advice.”So what exactly does this social learning involve? It’s a catch-all term for teachers learning from teachers in an informal but organised setting, rather than the traditional top-down classroom-style of continuing professional development (CPD). This learning might take place between teachers online – during a Twitter chat, for example – or it could be in real life at an event such as a TeachMeet, a Pedagoo conference or a WomenEd “unconference”.All these movements have something in common: they’re grassroots and volunteer-led. TeachMeets, for example, originated with a group of teachers in Scotland in 2006. The concept is simple: teachers meet up to share good practice, practical innovations and personal insights in teaching.Leadership consultant Harrison Owen’s idea “open space”, from the 1980s, inspired TeachMeets. When people get together to learn, he argued, they are more creative and productive if that meeting is fluid and organic, rather than operating within a rigid framework. So TeachMeets are free. There is no central organising body: anyone can volunteer to organise one, and anyone can present at one. Hundreds of TeachMeets now take place across the globe: just search on Twitter for the #TeachMeet hashtag and you’ll find teachers all over the world who share the movement’s ethos.Like that other great grassroots voluntary movement, Parkrun, there are a few rules. Presentations are either “nano” (two minutes long) or “micro” (seven minutes long). They must cover an aspect of good practice or a tool that enhances classroom practice. Order of presentations is chosen at random on the night. And for reasons lost in the mists of time, if you go over your allotted time, expect to have a toy camel chucked at you! TeachMeets are a fantastic way to not just gather ideas, but also to connect in real life with teachers in your area, helping you build your professional network.Pedagoo, another not-for-profit and voluntary movement, grew out of a collaborative blog created – again – by a group of teachers in Scotland. They organise teacher-led conferences every Saturday and run a lively Twitter hashtag, #PedagooFriday, where teachers post tips, experiences and triumphs. A typical #PedagooFriday takes in everything from the joy of conveying to a parent how well their child has done to the drama students’ highly creative examples of Halloween makeup. Again, the idea is simple: to provide a positive, teacher-led space for teachers to share what works.And aside from these movements, teachers have embraced simply using Twitter. The Twitter feeds of teachers such as @just-maths (23,900 followers) and @vicgoddard (21,600 followers) are great places to pitch a question or share a dilemma.Each subject has its own Twitter specialists, and that’s not even counting the potential to connect with big names to get amazing work out there. (Authors Michael Rosen and Neil Gaiman, to name just two, like to share Tweets from teachers using their books in the classroom to their thousands of followers.)Social learning is also having an impact on how CPD is delivered across the board. “It used to be very rigid – you must do this to get this particular impact,” says Morgan. “Now they’re incorporating different elements to get the best standard: collaborations with outstanding schools who will deliver CPD for us, for example, rather than doing everything online.”It’s an exciting time for teachers who love to share what works for them.

A woman has returned to Scotland from a holiday in Australia to discover a stowaway snake hidden in one of her shoes.In an incident that will confirm the worst fears of visitors to Australia, Moira Boxall unpacked her luggage after the more than 9,300-mile journey from Queensland to find the small and very much alive creature curled up in her slip-ons. It even shed its skin during its voyage in her footwear.The resilient reptile – later identified as a non-venomous spotted python, a breed commonly kept as a pet – travelled safely from Mackay to Glasgow, reported the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.Paul Airlie, Boxall’s son-in-law, told the ABC news network that when Boxall opened her bag and saw the animal she thought it was a toy put there as a prank.Airlie said throughout Boxall’s visit he had deliberately tried to downplay how common snakes were in Queensland, so as not to alarm her.After making the surprise discovery, Boxall put the shoe in the garden with a box over the top. She then called Airlie, who contacted the Scottish RSPCA.He told ABC: “She said she’s not so keen to come back and visit. But I suspect she will – she’ll have to think about it at first.”The snake is in quarantine in Scotland."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f69da012dfe6924635beb6d0ea69b799788c8ed/0_0_4752_2851/master/4752.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d83bb52c76114bf0a0fb7066550a02f","title":"concrete the most destructive material on earth","story":"After water, concrete is the most widely used substance on the planet. But its benefits mask enormous dangers to the planet, to human health – and to culture itselfIn the time it takes you to read this sentence, the global building industry will have poured more than 19,000 bathtubs of concrete. By the time you are halfway through this article, the volume would fill the Albert Hall and spill out into Hyde Park. In a day it would be almost the size of China’s Three Gorges Dam. In a single year, there is enough to patio over every hill, dale, nook and cranny in England.After water, concrete is the most widely used substance on Earth. If the cement industry were a country, it would be the third largest carbon dioxide emitter in the world with around 2.8bn tonnes, surpassed only by China and the US.The material is the foundation of modern development, putting roofs over the heads of billions, fortifying our defences against natural disaster and providing a structure for healthcare, education, transport, energy and industry.Concrete is how we try to tame nature. Our slabs protect us from the elements. They keep the rain from our heads, the cold from our bones and the mud from our feet. But they also entomb vast tracts of fertile soil, constipate rivers, choke habitats and – acting as a rock-hard second skin – desensitise us from what is happening outside our urban fortresses.Our species is addicted to concrete. We use more of it than anything else except water. Like that other manmade wonder material, plastic, concrete transformed construction and advanced human health. But, as with plastic, we are only now waking up to its dangers.Can we kick our addiction, when it\u0027s so hard to imagine modern life without it? This week  Cities celebrates the aesthetic and social achievements of concrete, while investigating its innumerable harms, to learn what we can\u0026nbsp do to bring about a less grey world.\u0026nbspOur blue and green world is becoming greyer by the second. By one calculation, we may have already passed the point where concrete outweighs the combined carbon mass of every tree, bush and shrub on the planet. Our built environment is, in these terms, outgrowing the natural one. Unlike the natural world, however, it does not actually grow. Instead, its chief quality is to harden and then degrade, extremely slowly.All the plastic produced over the past 60 years amounts to 8bn tonnes. The concrete industry pumps out more than that every two years. But though the problem is bigger than plastic, it is generally seen as less severe. Concrete is not derived from fossil fuels. It is not being found in the stomachs of whales and seagulls. Doctors aren’t discovering traces of it in our blood. Nor do we see it tangled in oak trees or contributing to subterranean fatbergs. We know where we are with concrete. Or to be more precise, we know where it is going: nowhere. Which is exactly why we have come to rely on it.This solidity, of course, is what humankind yearns for. Concrete is beloved for its weight and endurance. That is why it serves as the foundation of modern life, holding time, nature, the elements and entropy at bay. When combined with steel, it is the material that ensures our dams don’t burst, our tower blocks don’t fall, our roads don’t buckle and our electricity grid remains connected.Solidity is a particularly attractive quality at a time of disorientating change. But – like any good thing in excess – it can create more problems than it solves. At times an unyielding ally, at times a false friend, concrete can resist nature for decades and then suddenly amplify its impact. Take the floods in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and Houston after Harvey, which were more severe because urban and suburban streets could not soak up the rain like a floodplain, and storm drains proved woefully inadequate for the new extremes of a disrupted climate. This touches on the most severe, but least understood, impact of concrete, which is that it destroys natural infrastructure without replacing the ecological functions that humanity depends on for fertilisation, pollination, flood control, oxygen production and water purification.Concrete can take our civilisation upwards, up to 163 storeys high in the case of the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai, creating living space out of the air. But it also pushes the human footprint outwards, sprawling across fertile topsoil and choking habitats. The bioersity crisis – which many scientists believe to be as much of a threat as climate chaos – is driven primarily by the conversion of wilderness to agriculture, industrial estates and residential blocks.For hundreds of years, humanity has been willing to accept this environmental downside in return for the undoubted benefits of concrete. But the balance may now be tilting in the other direction.The Pantheon and Colosseum in Rome are testament to the durability of concrete, which is a composite of sand, aggregate (usually gravel or stones) and water mixed with a lime-based, kiln-baked binder. The modern industrialised form of the binder – Portland cement – was patented as a form of “artificial stone” in 1824 by Joseph Aspdin in Leeds. This was later combined with steel rods or mesh to create reinforced concrete, the basis for art deco skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building.Rivers of it were poured after the second world war, when concrete offered an inexpensive and simple way to rebuild cities devastated by bombing. This was the period of brutalist architects such as Le Corbusier, followed by the futuristic, free-flowing curves of Oscar Niemeyer and the elegant lines of Tadao Ando – not to mention an ever-growing legion of dams, bridges, ports, city halls, university campuses, shopping centres and uniformly grim car parks. In 1950, cement production was equal to that of steel in the years since, it has increased 25-fold, more than three times as fast as its metallic construction partner.Debate about the aesthetics has tended to polarise between traditionalists like Prince Charles, who condemned Owen Luder’s brutalist Tricorn Centre as a “mildewed lump of elephant droppings”, and modernists who saw concrete as a means of making style, size and strength affordable for the masses.The politics of concrete are less isive, but more corrosive. The main problem here is inertia. Once this material binds politicians, bureaucrats and construction companies, the resulting nexus is almost impossible to budge. Party leaders need the donations and kickbacks from building firms to get elected, state planners need more projects to maintain economic growth, and construction bosses need more contracts to keep money rolling in, staff employed and political influence high. Hence the self-perpetuating political enthusiasm for environmentally and socially dubious infrastructure projects and cement-fests like the Olympics, the World Cup and international exhibitions.The classic example is Japan, which embraced concrete in the second half of the 20th century with such enthusiasm that the country’s governance structure was often described as the doken kokka (construction state).At first it was a cheap material to rebuild cities ravaged by fire bombs and nuclear warheads in the second world war. Then it provided the foundations for a new model of super-rapid economic development: new railway tracks for Shinkansen bullet trains, new bridges and tunnels for elevated expressways, new runways for airports, new stadiums for the 1964 Olympics and the Osaka Expo, and new city halls, schools and sports facilities.This kept the economy racing along at near double-digit growth rates until the late 1980s, ensuring employment remained high and giving the ruling Liberal Democratic party a stranglehold on power. The political heavyweights of the era – men such as Kakuei Tanaka, Yasuhiro Nakasone and Noboru Takeshita – were judged by their ability to bring hefty projects to their hometowns. Huge kickbacks were the norm. Yakuza gangsters, who served as go-betweens and enforcers, also got their cut. Bid-rigging and near monopolies by the big six building firms (Shimizu, Taisei, Kajima, Takenaka, Obayashi, Kumagai) ensured contracts were lucrative enough to provide hefty kickbacks to the politicians. The doken kokka was a racket on a national scale.In his book Dogs and Demons, the author and longtime Japanese resident Alex Kerr laments the cementing over of riverbanks and hillsides in the name of flood and mudslide prevention. Runaway government-subsidised construction projects, he told an interviewer, “have wreaked untold damage on mountains, rivers, streams, lakes, wetlands, everywhere — and it goes on at a heightened pace. That is the reality of modern Japan, and the numbers are staggering.”Traditionalists and environmentalists were horrified – and ignored. The cementation of Japan ran contrary to classic aesthetic ideals of harmony with nature and an appreciation of mujo (impermanence), but was understandable given the ever-present fear of earthquakes and tsunamis in one of the world’s most seismically active nations. Everyone knew the grey banked rivers and shorelines were ugly, but nobody cared as long as they could keep their homes from being flooded.Which made the devastating 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami all the more shocking. At coastal towns such as Ishinomaki, Kamaishi and Kitakami, huge sea walls that had been built over decades were swamped in minutes. Almost 16,000 people died, a million buildings were destroyed or damaged, town streets were blocked with beached ships and port waters were filled with floating cars. It was a still more alarming story at Fukushima, where the ocean surge engulfed the outer defences of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant and caused a level 7 meltdown.Construction firms were once again ordered to hold back the sea, this time with even taller, thicker barriers. Their value is contested. Engineers claim these 12-metre-high walls of concrete will stop or at least slow future tsunamis, but locals have heard such promises before. The area these defences protect is also of lower human worth now the land has been largely depopulated and filled with paddy fields and fish farms. Environmentalists say mangrove forests could provide a far cheaper buffer. Tellingly, even many tsunami-scarred locals hate the concrete between them and the ocean.“It feels like we’re in jail, even though we haven’t done anything bad,” an oyster fisherman, Atsushi Fujita, told Reuters. “We can no longer see the sea,” said the Tokyo-born photographer Tadashi Ono, who took some of the most powerful images of these massive new structures. He described them as an abandonment of Japanese history and culture. “Our richness as a civilisation is because of our contact with the ocean,” he said. “Japan has always lived with the sea, and we were protected by the sea. And now the Japanese government has decided to shut out the sea.”There was an inevitability about this. Across the world, concrete has become synonymous with development. In theory, the laudable goal of human progress is measured by a series of economic and social indicators, such as life-expectancy, infant mortality and education levels. But to political leaders, by far the most important metric is gross domestic product, a measure of economic activity that, more often than not, is treated as a calculation of economic size. GDP is how governments assess their weight in the world. And nothing bulks up a country like concrete.That is true of all countries at some stage. During their early stages of development, heavyweight construction projects are beneficial like a boxer putting on muscle. But for already mature economies, it is harmful like an aged athlete pumping ever stronger steroids to ever less effect. During the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, Keynesian economic advisers told the Japanese government the best way to stimulate GDP growth was to dig a hole in the ground and fill it. Preferably with cement. The bigger the hole, the better. This meant profits and jobs. Of course, it is much easier to mobilise a nation to do something that improves people’s lives, but either way concrete is likely to be part of the arrangement. This was the thinking behind Roosevelt’s New Deal in the 1930s, which is celebrated in the US as a recession-busting national project but might also be described as the biggest ever concrete-pouring exercise up until that point. The Hoover Dam alone required 3.3m cubic metres, then a world record. Construction firms claimed it would outlast human civilisation. But that was lightweight compared to what is now happening in China, the concrete superpower of the 21st century and the greatest illustration of how the material transforms a culture (a civilisation intertwined with nature) into an economy (a production unit obsessed by GDP statistics). Beijing’s extraordinarily rapid rise from developing nation to superpower-in-waiting has required mountains of cement, beaches of sand and lakes of water. The speed at which these materials are being mixed is perhaps the most astonishing statistic of the modern age: since 2003, China has poured more cement every three years than the US managed in the entire 20th century.Today, China uses almost half the world’s concrete. The property sector – roads, bridges, railways, urban development and other cement-and-steel projects – accounted for a third of its economy’s expansion in 2017. Every major city has a floor-sized scale model of urban development plans that has to be constantly updated as small white plastic models are turned into mega-malls, housing complexes and concrete towers.But, like the US, Japan, South Korea and every other country that “developed” before it, China is reaching the point where simply pouring concrete does more harm than good. Ghost malls, half-empty towns and white elephant stadiums are a growing sign of wasteful spending. Take the huge new airport in Luliang, which opened with barely five flights a day, or the Olympic Bird’s Nest stadium, so underused that it is now more a monument than a venue. Although the adage “build and the people will come” has often proved correct in the past, the Chinese government is worried. After the National Bureau of Statistics found 450 sq km of unsold residential floor space, the country’s president, Xi Jinping, called for the “annihilation” of excess developments.Empty, crumbling structures are not just an eyesore, but a drain on the economy and a waste of productive land. Ever greater construction requires ever more cement and steel factories, discharging ever more pollution and carbon dioxide. As the Chinese landscape architect Yu Kongjian has pointed out, it also suffocates the ecosystems – fertile soil, self-cleansing streams, storm-resisting mangrove swamps, flood-preventing forests – on which human beings ultimately depend. It is a threat to what he calls “eco-security”.Yu has led the charge against concrete, ripping it up whenever possible to restore riverbanks and natural vegetation. In his influential book The Art of Survival, he warns that China has moved dangerously far from Taoist ideals of harmony with nature. “The urbanisation process we follow today is a path to death,” he has said.Yu has been consulted by government officials, who are increasingly aware of the brittleness of the current Chinese model of growth. But their scope for movement is limited. The initial momentum of a concrete economy is always followed by inertia in concrete politics. The president has promised a shift of economic focus away from belching heavy industries and towards high-tech production in order to create a “beautiful country” and an “ecological civilisation”, and the government is now trying to wind down from the biggest construction boom in human history, but Xi cannot let the construction sector simply fade away, because it employs more than 55 million workers – almost the entire population of the UK. Instead, China is doing what countless other nations have done, exporting its environmental stress and excess capacity overseas.Beijing’s much-vaunted Belt and Road Initiative – an overseas infrastructure investment project many times greater than the Marshall Plan – promises a splurge of roads in Kazakhstan, at least 15 dams in Africa, railways in Brazil and ports in Pakistan, Greece and Sri Lanka. To supply these and other projects, China National Building Material – the country’s biggest cement producer – has announced plans to construct 100 cement factories across 50 nations. This will almost certainly mean more criminal activity. As well as being the primary vehicle for super-charged national building, the construction industry is also the widest channel for bribes. In many countries, the correlation is so strong, people see it as an index: the more concrete, the more corruption.As elsewhere, the craze for concrete in South America’s biggest nation started benignly enough as a means of social development, then morphed into an economic necessity, and finally metastasised into a tool for political expediency and inidual greed. The progress between these stages was impressively rapid. The first huge national project in the late 1950s was the construction of a new capital, Brasília, on an almost uninhabited plateau in the interior. A million cubic metres of concrete were poured on the highlands site in just 41 months to encase the soil and erect new edifices for ministries and homes.This was followed by a new highway through the Amazon rainforest – the TransAmazonia – and then from 1970, South America’s biggest hydroelectric power plant, the Itaipu on the Paraná river border with Paraguay, which is almost four times bulkier than the Hoover Dam. The Brazilian operators boast the 12.3m cubic metres of concrete would be enough to fill 210 Maracaña stadiums. This was a world record until China’s Three Gorges Dam choked the Yangtze with 27.2m cubic metres.With the military in power, the press censored and no independent judiciary, there was no way of knowing how much of the budget was siphoned off by the generals and contractors. But the problem of corruption has become all too apparent since 1985 in the post-dictatorship era, with virtually no party or politician left untainted.For many years, the most notorious of them was Paulo Maluf, the governor of São Paulo, who had run the city during the construction of the giant elevated expressway known as Minhocão, which means Big Worm. As well as taking credit for this project, which opened in 1969, he also allegedly skimmed $1bn from public works in just four years, part of which has been traced to secret accounts in the British Virgin islands. Although wanted by Interpol, Maluf evaded justice for decades and was elected to a number of senior public offices. This was thanks to a high degree of public cynicism encapsulated by the phrase most commonly used about him: “He steals, but he gets things done” – which could describe much of the global concrete industry.But his reputation as the most corrupt man in Brazil has been overshadowed in the past five years by Operation Car Wash, an investigation into a vast network of bid-rigging and money laundering. Giant construction firms – notably Odebrecht, Andrade Gutierrez and Camargo Corrêa – were at the heart of this sprawling scheme, which saw politicians, bureaucrats and middle-men receive at least $2bn worth of kickbacks in return for hugely inflated contracts for oil refineries, the Belo Monte dam, the 2016 World Cup, the 2018 Olympics and dozens of other infrastructure projects throughout the region. Prosecutors said Odebrecht alone had paid bribes to 415 politicians and 26 political parties.As a result of these revelations, one government fell, a former president of Brazil and the vice president of Ecuador are in prison, the president of Peru was forced to resign, and dozens of other politicians and executives were put behind bars. The corruption scandal also reached Europe and Africa. The US Department of Justice called it “the largest foreign bribery case in history”. It was so huge that when Maluf was finally arrested in 2017, nobody batted an eyelid.Such corruption is not just a theft of tax revenue, it is a motivation for environmental crime: billions of tonnes of CO2 pumped into the atmosphere for projects of dubious social value and often pushed through – as in the case of Belo Monte – against the opposition of affected local residents and with deep concerns among environmental licensing authorities.Chatham House predicts urbanisation, population growth and economic development will push global cement production from 4 to 5bn tonnes a year. If developing countries expand their infrastructure to current average global levels, the construction sector will emit 470 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide by 2050, according to the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate.The dangers are recognised. A report last year by Chatham House calls for a rethink in the way cement is produced. To reduce emissions, it urges greater use of renewables in production, improved energy efficiency, more substitutes for clinker and, most important, the widespread adoption of carbon capture and storage technology – though this is expensive and has not yet been deployed in the industry on a commercial scale.Architects believe the answer is to make buildings leaner and, when possible, to use other materials, such as cross-laminated timber. It is time to move out of the “concrete age” and stop thinking primarily about how a building looks, said Anthony Thistleton.“Concrete is beautiful and versatile but, unfortunately, it ticks all the boxes in terms of environmental degradation,” he told the Architects Journal. “We have a responsibility to think about all the materials we are using and their wider impact.”But many engineers argue that there is no viable alternative. Steel, asphalt and plasterboard are more energy intensive than concrete. The world’s forests are already being depleted at an alarming rate even without a surge in extra demand for timber.Phil Purnell, a professor of materials and structures at Leeds University, said the world was unlikely to reach a “peak concrete” moment.“The raw materials are virtually limitless and it will be in demand for as long as we build roads, bridges and anything else that needs a foundation,” he said. “By almost any measure it’s the least energy-hungry of all materials.”Instead, he calls for existing structures to be better maintained and conserved, and, when that is not possible, to enhance recycling. Currently most concrete goes to landfill sites or is crushed and reused as aggregate. This could be done more efficiently, Purnell said, if slabs were embedded with identification tags that would allow the material to be matched with demand. His colleagues at Leeds University are also exploring alternatives to Portland cement. Different mixes can reduce the carbon footprint of a binder by up to two-thirds, they say.Arguably more important still is a change of mindset away from a developmental model that replaces living landscapes with built environments and nature-based cultures with data-driven economies. That requires tackling power structures that have been built on concrete, and recognising that fertility is a more reliable base for growth than solidity.

So it has been alarming, in the past few years, to watch the two main parties surrendering to different versions of the teleological delusion.The Conservative party has embraced Brexit as a mythic nativist destiny towards which we must all march loyally. Labour, meanwhile, is in thrall to the old left determinism, in which all the core debates have long since been settled, devotion to the leadership must be absolute, and all that remains is for those who are foolish enough to think otherwise to be stripped of their false consciousness. For those of us who believe in pluralist politics, it has been a depressing spectacle, a battle between desperate certainties that slide pointlessly over the gritty, unpredictable reality of 21st-century life. Which is the principal reason why the foundation of the 11-strong Independent Group of formerly Labour and Tory MPs has been so refreshing.I have been sceptical in the past about the notion of a new centre party – but am pleased to have been (thus far) confounded. As Heidi Allen and Luciana Berger showed on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, the group has no intention of being pressed into announcing policies prematurely, rushing to form a party hierarchy, or of seeking to disguise their differences. Instead, they are turning these disagreements into a strength and striving – in Chuka Umunna’s words – to be “culturally different”. They will prosper to the extent that they make good this promise. They must put strategy before tactics (incredibly hard). They cannot afford to look like the liberal elite demanding its job back. They must be rigorous in addressing new challenges rather than re-litigating old battles. They must continue to act with dignity in the face of seething social media fury – especially strong from some Corbynites, whose treatment of the escapees has been reminiscent of Scientology’s hounding of “suppressive persons”.But what the independents have already done is important: more important, perhaps, than the formation of the Social Democratic party in 1981. The “gang of four” was a breakaway faction of the Labour party. The Independent Group has genuinely bipartisan roots. And – unlike the SDP – it is starting its life in the crucible of a full-blown constitutional crisis.Whether it succeeds or fails, it has already acted as a much-needed solvent of the certainties that have paralysed Westminster during the Brexit process. It has reintroduced the indeterminacy principle to mainstream politics and, most specifically, shown those who fetishise the 2016 referendum result as if it were the burning bush of our era – a quasi-ine mandate – that leaving the EU is still, as a matter of fact, entirely voluntary. We can still step away from the precipice, if we choose, as a nation, to do so.Even as the 11 coalesced, three cabinet ministers – Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark – published a truly remarkable article in the Daily Mail signalling their support for an extension of article 50 to prevent a no-deal outcome “if there is no breakthrough in the coming week”. It is hard to exaggerate the significance of this intervention. Theresa May’s defining mission – her reason for remaining in the job – is to take Britain out of the EU on 29 March. With a degree of repetition remarkable even by her standards, she has said that no-deal must stay on the table as a bargaining chip.Rudd, Gauke and Clark have issued a flagrant challenge to this, the last sacred principle of Mayism. And they have done so, thus far, with impunity. They know full well that a formal delay would smash to pieces the framework within which the Commons has operated since backing the government’s article 50 bill in February 2017.It would, for a start, dramatically oxygenate the argument in favour of a further referendum. It is already gaining fresh momentum, as Labour edges towards something approaching endorsement. In his fractious Sky News interview last week, Jeremy Corbyn made clear that he still loathes the idea, and would only countenance a public vote on a Labour deal: a precondition of which, presumably, would be the election of a Labour government. Deputy leader Tom Watson came much closer to the centre of gravity of opinion in his party on Sunday, when he said that Labour should back a fresh referendum if May rejects the party’s five-point Brexit plan (which she already has). This week, even though the meaningful vote has been postponed again, MPs will be given the chance to vote on Yvette Cooper’s amendment that would seize control of the parliamentary agenda and require the prime minister to seek such an extension (unless a deal is reached by 13 March). In January, Cooper’s binding proposal was defeated by a margin of 23 votes – while Caroline Spelman’s nonbinding motion against no-deal secured a majority of eight. In other words: we’d like to do the right thing, but we’re not allowed to. Sorry.On Wednesday, there will be only 30 days left until the official Brexit date. If that doesn’t focus the mind, I don’t know what will. Those wavering MPs who still feel constrained by narrow ideological loyalties, the haranguing of the whips, the dead slogans of a three-year-old campaign, should look at the 11 MPs who decided to cast aside those chains. They should ask themselves whether, for once, the claims of the public interest, of common sense and of future generations might just trump all else. They should ask: if not now, when?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7f643469d77687b9fefc3b47f7aded0d5b14069/0_14_3394_2037/master/3394.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b0a7af13b10ac98c76fe0445e361289","title":"disability barbie dolls emojis","story":"Time and time again, a distortion that is not us appears in the mirror. We need our own voicesYou’re aged 10 and you’ve never seen anyone like you. You do your best to hide the fact that you’re disabled, taking care to never wear shorts and seeking out boot-cut trousers to slide over your calliper. You think you’ll grow out of your disability, get through it like a growth spurt. When that doesn’t happen you’re devastated. The smell of a hospital is enough to send you into a frenzy of shame. You are 12 and unsure why people on the street – adults, the elderly, fellow children – stare at you so intently. You don’t know why you’re so angry when they stare. The odd few brave enough to come up and ask you about your disability make you writhe and squirm with despair.In your late teens you come across a book by a writer named Christy Brown. It’s the first time you’ve seen the words “cerebral palsy” outside of hospital waiting rooms and doctor’s appointments. It scares you. You don’t read the book for years. When you’re an adult you come across a song called Spasticus Autisticus. You love it more than you’ve ever loved anything. You murmur the chorus to yourself like a hymn. A new feeling starts surging in your veins. You read John Callahan, Vassar Miller and Larry Eigner. You feel a thrill you’ve never felt before. You’re finding a history you didn’t know you had. You begin to know that your culture has been lying to you. You start saying disabled is beautiful. You’ve become yourself.Such a journey, in almost total isolation, shouldn’t be the norm. A disabled person shouldn’t have to hunt for their history and excavate it like long-lost dinosaur bones. A disabled person should see themselves, from the minute they’re born to the moment they die, which is why the news of disabled emojis being approved for use is so exciting. The new emojis include wheelchairs, hearing aids, prosthetic limbs, guide dogs and more. Encouragingly, Apple consulted disabled organisations such as the American Council of the Blind. Is the phrase used in disability activism – “nothing about us without us” – beginning to sink in?Barbie, which has more influence than we dare imagine, is also showcasing disability, front and centre, unapologetically. Barbie will debut two dolls, one featuring a prosthetic leg and another in a wheelchair, in June. A ramp, to make Barbie’s Dreamhouse accessible, is included. Barbie’s manufacturer Mattel commented that a wheelchair has been among the most frequently requested accessories for the doll.Emojis and Barbie dolls may not sound like much to you, but representation, whether it comes via books and films or emojis and Barbie dolls, is immensely powerful. If I had even something as simple as an emoji representing myself as a kid, I wouldn’t have felt so isolated. Representation isn’t an abstract concept children (and adults) feel accepted and wanted when they see themselves. Even today, if I see myself in my culture in any way, whether it’s films, books or on the street, I feel a visceral thrill. I can only imagine how my adolescent self would have reacted to seeing himself.Having disabled emojis and dolls is an important first step in ensuring that disability is a part of our everyday conversation. Emojis and dolls are the punctuation of our lives, we all use them or are at least aware of them. By taking first steps towards representation, we can ensure that future generations of disabled children and adults don’t feel so isolated, frightened and uneasy. No one should have to go through the isolation of seeing nothing in the mirror. We can ensure that disabled children can look in the mirror and say: “Disabled is beautiful, I am disabled. What of it?”.More than one billion people worldwide are disabled, yet our representations of that wealth of experience are painfully inept. My Left Foot, which turns 30 this week, remains the single most well-known depiction of cerebral palsy on screen. The film does no justice to Christy Brown, the novelist who changed my world. Brown is reduced from a towering writer to inspiration porn. Bryan Cranston “cripped up” to play a paralysed man in The Upside. Writers and producers saw nothing wrong in portraying an autistic person as a literal prop, a grey-faced, hollow-eyed puppet. Time and time again, a distortion appears in the mirror rather than our reflection. We need our own voices in culture our own Netflix shows, plays, movies and books. We need our own good disabled characters and bad ones and mediocre ones. We need disabled public figures and celebrities. We need emojis and Barbie dolls. We all deserve to be seen.• Karl Knights is a writer focusing on representation, disability and culture"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d26616daeeb9b867e483b1ddf765c366de952947/0_0_5065_3038/master/5065.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4745bcb6379dc7c8234bdf1dcf43cb42","title":"independent mps gang of 11 remainers","story":"As a former independent, I know the challenges involved. But the ‘gang of 11’ are also remainers’ last hope of salvationLet us start with the wisdom of Edmund Burke, the founding father of not-so-thoughtless conservatism: “The unfortunate independent member has nothing to offer but harsh refusal, or pitiful excuse, or despondent representation of a hopeless interest … In the House, he votes for ever in a dispirited minority … Can we conceive of a more discouraging post of duty than this?”I did it for four years, from 1997 to 2001, and believe that Burke was wrong. Looking back on it, I reflected that being an MP, like being a soldier, was something that I did not much enjoy doing, but I enjoyed having done. And I found a friendly space in the House of Commons. MPs on all sides treated me as an historical oddity rather than a threat to their party system. My parliamentary friends were of the awkward squad.The country is teeming with former MPs for Tatton. George Osborne, the editor of the London Evening Standard, is one. I am another. A third is Neil Hamilton. Remember him? He is the only one of us still in politics. He represents Ukip in the Welsh assembly.My case was different from that of the new independents, splitters from mainstream political parties, nine from Labour and three from the Conservatives (so far – there may be more). In true blue Tatton, the then opposition parties, Labour and Liberal Democrat, stood down their candidates to give me a free run at the incumbent Tory. I beat him by 11,000 votes.But the breakaway independents will find, as I did, that even the furniture is against them. For a start, they have nowhere to sit. Unlike the Lords there is no cross-bench – just a single seat facing the Speaker, beneath the throne of the serjeant at arms. But it is behind the bar of the House, which is a grey line on the carpet. I was once declared by the deputy speaker to be not in the House because I was there and not in one of the green seats beside it. I then moved to the opposition benches to keep the company of the likes of Alex Salmond and my old antagonist from Northern Ireland, the Rev Ian Paisley.The new independents will find, however, that they have many advantages. They no longer have to attend the meetings of their parliamentary parties or constituency associations. They no longer have to argue for policies and practices, especially on Brexit, they no longer believe in. Every vote they cast is a free vote.They can leave personal ambition behind and cease to aspire to be deputy chief whip or parliamentary private secretary (bag-carrier to a secretary of state). Being a backbencher is an honourable occupation, and no one is more backbench than an independent. And they can immerse themselves on their constituency business as they never could before.I spent much time as an MP visiting the primary schools and encouraging the young to take an interest in their futures. It was the heyday of the Spice Girls. The headteacher told me after one of these sessions that a nine-year-old had described me as being like the sixth Spice Girl. Immensely gratified, I enquired what manner of spice that should be. “Old Spice!” she said.Something else I discovered was that if I came across two MPs in a bar or a corridor almost coming to blows, they were invariably of the same political party. Their opponents were in front of them, but their enemies were all around them.We live in extraordinary times, inside the House and out of it. Anything can and already is happening. The political parties have atrophied and been held hostage by their zealots, leaving the centre ground to be reoccupied by political refugees. So here is my advice to the “gang of 11” in the Independent Group (or however many they may turn out to be.) First, enjoy your newfound freedom. Not only do you not have to attend a party conference ever again, you can hold (as I did) an annual event in your constituency which is all party and no conference. Second, the next time around, stand for re-election. It will not be easy, especially against the candidates of your former parties, but in an age of weaker party allegiances it surely can be done. Richard Taylor, the former independent MP for Wyre Forest, achieved it in 2001.Third, keep your promises. I could have stood for a second term in Tatton in 2001, but I would have had to break a promise to do so. Instead I lost to Eric Pickles in Brentwood and Ongar, but not by much. He must have forgiven me, because years later when we shared a platform at a public event he gave me a big hug. And when you have been hugged by Eric Pickles, you have really been hugged. (The same applies to Ann Widdecombe, but that is another story.)Fourth and last, the stakes have never been higher. As we blunder towards the cliff edge of a no-deal Brexit, it seems to remainers and Europhiles like myself that our last chance of salvation lies with a group of truly honourable members who have left the parties to save the people, all of us.• Martin Bell is a former television war correspondent and politician"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f01ae6e1d2ba1b7ae8d1a6325057fcff27c93e20/0_108_3120_1872/master/3120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af616d417455472737d666064f86ecde","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of smooth","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘smooth’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘smooth’.Share your photos of what smooth means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 27 February at 10am.

The film, written and directed by Chiwetel Ejiofor, premiered at the Sundance film festival in late January. It tells the story of how William, then 14, was forced to drop out of school during a deadly famine that struck Malawi in 2000-2001. As his family and neighbors slowly starved, he found refuge in a local library, where he discovered books that inspired him to build a series of windmills from tractor and bicycle partsto produce electricity for his village, and to eventually pump water. After speaking at the TED Global conference in 2007, William was able to return to school and later graduated from Dartmouth College.In 2010, after the book’s release, William and I sold the film rights to Chiwetel, who is Nigerian and had grown up visiting his family in villages much like William’s. Chiwetel would go on to star in many films over the next decade, including 12 Years a Slave, which earned him best actor at the British Academy Film Awards along with an Oscar nomination for best actor. This week, I spoke with Chiwetel on the phone in London, where he was fresh off the Berlin international film festival, to discuss his directorial debut.How did you first come across The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind?I was living in Los Angeles at the time and a friend had attended your book party and told me about it. I was just stunned by it, really. It was clear it was operating on several different levels with a very determined humility to it and this real sense of time and place and authenticity and a very lived-in sense of the world. There was no fairy tale Africa, or the other side, the nightmare Africa.When I met William in 2007, I’d just finished reporting the war in the Congo for three years, so I’d been engrossed in that nightmare version, even contributed to it. That’s why his story was so refreshing to me – it really captured the resourcefulness and tenacity you see every day on that continent, in addition to the mundane.Right. It dealt with Malawi and those deep family dynamics in a real way, and it was a space that I recognized. Look, there is no generic Africa. Nigeria is different from Malawi but there were connections and similarities that I recognized. I felt it would be powerful to tell a story that was honest about the challenges and the triumphs of a place.The book is very much a father and son story. I know you lost your own father when you were 11 in a car crash while visiting Nigeria, an accident in which you were also severely injured. Looking at your childhood there seems to be some parallels – or at least an understanding of what may have drawn you to the story. Is that accurate?Most of my childhood was spent in London, but we visited family a lot. Over a period of years, I understood the dynamics enough to be intrigued by the villages.We’d spend time in Enugu, but I was aware of the rich cultural spaces the villages represented, this real complex and nuanced space where generations of families lived. You’re trying to keep up with everyone, and at some point, you realize that this square mile you’re standing in is all of you, and it’s deeply connected to your sense of place in the world. It’s the wellspring from which all things have happened in your family’s life. I also knew that from an outside perspective it probably looked very simple and impoverished. So there was something about that that resonated, that connected the book to my family and wanting to explore their experience.And there was also that dynamic between father and son that I immediately hooked into, my relationship to my father and the fact that he hasn’t been with us in 30 years. It’s still an evolving relationship and it still has a strong space in my life. Those were big themes that jumped out from the book.After your father’s death your mother started the Brightland International Academy in Enugu, which educates underprivileged kids, a school that you’re still very involved with today … William’s story was perfect for you.It was perfect, but I also loved it because William’s story also lives in the solution, in the brighter future. People can identify and find solutions for their own issues, as opposed to being presented as victims everyone else is going to help. We’ve tried it that way, this paternalistic way, and it’s disempowering.I love how the movie, which has an entirely black cast, has allowed you to talk about ersity in film. Throughout your career, you’ve come back to Africa – playing Patrice Lumumba in the play A Season in the Congo at London’s Young Vic, starred in the adaptation of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s Half a Yellow Sun, addressed apartheid in Endgame and Red Dust, and now you’re directing this film …There are epic stories to be told there. I’ve always been excited by the combination of these western traditions of cinema and these epic stories in Africa. There’s always been an overlap that’s been rarely explored. There’s a rich narrative landscape for people to embrace and fall in love with.The film is shot entirely in William’s village in Wimbe. Because of that, you were able to accomplish a rare feat – realistically portray African village life, which doesn’t make it into western living rooms that often.You mentioned somewhere that one of your first references before making the film were the impressionist painters, and how they’d managed to capture these peasants in rural, impoverished France with such romanticism, scope, and beauty. Any other inspirations?I stated looking at Vittorio De Sica’s Bicycle Thieves, a film that I’ve always loved. I felt like that neo-realism had such a resonance for me. Post-war Italy dealing with all that poverty, that broken structure, and yet this father and son at the center of it finding this new space to communicate and express themselves was a very influential story, not to mention the bicycle at the center.Another major influence was Haile Gerima and his film Harvest: 3,000 Years. Released in 1977, it’s about the famine in Ethiopia. I couldn’t find it anywhere and finally the British Film Institute had a copy they screened for me. I could watch that film every day for 1,000 years. I actually went to meet Gerima in Washington to talk with him and get his advice. He was very moved that William was stressed by the conditions of his family, and he said that was the heart of his motivation, that somehow subconsciously he was aware that these conditions were wrong, that something was broken in the expression of humanity. His motivating energy was to reconnect with what things should be. You famously learned to play violin for the role of Solomon Northup in 12 Years a Slave. For The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind, you and several others in the cast had to learn Chichewa during the 37 days on location. Which was easier, learning violin or Chichewa?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15ecf96563f579cf812eb892728422ba4a6a454b/0_38_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5bc4d7b1b28b368e4850102b6c57fa0e","title":"teachers experience more stress than other workers study shows","story":"Teachers endure greater job-related stress than other professionals, according to the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER).Although teachers’ working hours across the year were similar to those in other professions, working intensively over fewer weeks of the year led to a poorer work-life balance and higher stress levels, the NFER observed.Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said the report echoed the longstanding concerns about the anxieties faced by teachers.“The reasons that so many leave the profession so quickly are not a mystery to us,” she said. “When faced with impossible workloads, endless accountability, a testing culture run riot and flat or underfunded pay deals year after year, it is all too common for good teachers to leave the profession.”The NFER called for urgent action to address the shortfall in the number of trainee teachers amid a significant drop in retention rates of early career teachers, noting the higher job security graduates can enjoy outside of the profession.Jack Worth, co-author of the report, said: “England’s schools are facing significant challenges in recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of teachers … There is a clear need to improve the working conditions of teachers, with a focus on making the teaching career more manageable and sustainable.”The report comes after the department for education published its Teacher Recruitment and Retention Strategy in January to address the growing shortage of teachers by reducing workloads and simplifying the application process.The education secretary, Damian Hinds, said: “Since I took this job a year ago, I’ve made cutting down the amount of unnecessary and bureaucratic workload teachers face my top priority – to address the issues highlighted in this report and free up teachers to focus on what they joined the profession to do: teach.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4102ee315eb44d4743cb4c05f9d247e703e8f5dd/0_397_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58f1b69af74d8b7f071bb5451a1efc37","title":"early spring share your photographs and stories","story":"We want your help documenting the situation as record temperatures bring early signs of spring across EuropeAfter one of the hottest summers ever in 2018 and a mild winter across much of Europe, record temperatures are suggesting spring is once more beginning earlier than usual.Swallows and house martins have been spotted more than a month earlier than usual and temperatures are up to 20C higher than this time last year.

Trucks ferry massive rocket props, machinery grinds as it would in any construction zone, the sky is a crystal blue. The scene is, in a word, vibrant — so startlingly alive that for the first few minutes, I wasn’t sure if I was watching footage from 1969 or a NASA promo shot from last year.That present-ness is one of the film’s major feats, credit due to director Todd Douglas Miller, who has found a brilliant way to portray the first moon landing by doing nothing more than the gargantuan task of faithfully rejuvenating the historical record. The documentary is seamless curation of archival work Miller and his team, in partnership with Nasa and the National Archives, sifted through 11,000 hours of uncatalogued audio and restored reams of original film, including hyper-detail 70mm footage that languished in the archives, boxed up and forgotten, since 1969. The result is a stunning project of historical preservation – no narration, no cutaway interviews, no recreations, just original material synced with some music and the occasional diagram.Apollo 11 arrives early in the mission’s 50th anniversary year, which means the significance of the nation’s space program, from JFK’s promise to put a man on the moon to the famous television broadcast of Neil Armstrong’s first steps, will be under review. Already, the Apollo missions have proved fertile territory for filmmakers Damien Chazelle’s Armstrong biopic, First Man, offered a deeply studied take on the astronaut and his time in space, while documentaries such as Mission Control: The Unsung Heroes of Apollo combined archives with present-day interviews. Both set a steep goal of bringing an event so entrenched and replicated in the American cultural lexicon to life so it’s a bit ironic that the filmmakers of the all-archive Apollo 11, who step so far back in 1969 as to be nearly invisible, achieve it.The 93-minute film is anchored by four pivotal moments in the Apollo 11 mission: lift-off, landing the Eagle rover on the moon, reconnecting Eagle with the Columbia spacecraft to return home, and re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere. We already know the outcome of these risks, and yet the sequences are still mesmerizing. With a score that ranges from swelling orchestra to a single thump, thump, thump of a heartbeat, coupled with stitches of headset and Mission Control recordings, the movie’s technical spacecraft scenes are less suspense baits than genuinely moving, hypnotic odes to teamwork.The film’s emotional power, however, comes not in the documentation of astronauts in space (though that is, of course, undeniably arresting, even half a century on), but in the absolutely incredible footage of the crowds who watched the launch from Earth. Miller’s team meticulously restored wide-lens footage, taken by Nasa’s team on the morning of 16 July, of the nearly one million people who gathered on the shores of Florida to watch the take-off the result is a luminous portal into another, more bouffanted America, one far away, with its old cars and outdated Penney’s logo, but with familiar parking lot parties. The Apollo 11 mission looms so large in American lore — “one small step for man,” you can fill in the rest — that it seems like a tremendous act of respect on behalf of the film-makers to ground the nine-day mission in its quotidian, idiosyncratic, and sometimes (in the case of the astronauts’ press tour) hammy moments. Apollo 11 juxtaposes massive feats of scale — groundbreaking engineering, built with thousands of minds in cooperation — with mid-century modern ketchup packets and outdated bathing caps. That Miller’s film allows you, without commentary, to make meaning of these contrasts — the whole of Earth in one shot, a parking lot PB\u0026ampJ snack shack in another — feels like a radical act of trust.I keep waiting to find a fault with Apollo 11, as I usually have to do with things I love at first glance. And while there are legitimate criticisms of America’s space program, it’s hard to argue with a film that defers so humbly to the primary source material. There’s a deep pleasure, especially now, in immersive historical voyeurism, in the illusion that we can transcend the limitations of our own time and understand another collective experience. And there’s something deeply kind in letting the archives stand on their own, of giving the evidence we have of what happened in July 1969 the space to breathe. Perhaps it’s that space — a record of people and incredulity and intense focus, without talking heads or hyperbole — that’s the great humanizing force of Apollo 11."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67df1fbe6a4b8705e7c3f0d5ad2b480b7cef1556/0_230_2761_1657/master/2761.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d04f2b7fc50d3e3f01d68f6d10170beb","title":"olivia colman 15 things","story":"En route to Tinseltown glory, Norwich’s finest has devised a royal theft, endured on-stage disaster and been given odd career advice1 She performed the voiceover for the Andrex “be kind to your behind” adverts in 2013. “I did ask if I could get paid in puppies,” she revealed. “They said no.”2 Before turning her sights to acting she trained as a primary-school teacher at Homerton College, Cambridge.4 During her university years she auditioned successfully for the Cambridge Footlights troupe, where she met David Mitchell and Robert Webb – in whose sitcom Peep Show she went on to star as Sophie Chapman.5 After graduating she worked as a cleaner and secretary (“not a very good one”).6 Her preparation for the role of Carol Thatcher (Margaret’s daughter) in The Iron Lady involved close scrutiny of her appearances on I’m a Celebrity… “to get her voice right”.7 Colman attended the same school, Greshams, as Stephen Frears (and Benjamin Britten, WH Auden and Sir James Dyson).8 She gained two and a half stone to play the cake-guzzling Queen Anne for her Oscar-winning turn in The Favourite.

Olivia Colman already had the title of queen of all our hearts, and, just when it looked as if Yorgos Lanthimos’s The Favourite was going to go home with nothing at all, Colman added the Academy Award to her bulging silverware cabinet – and of course gave a speech of great charm and grace.Her prize acceptance game this year has been off the chart: stylish, polished and with just enough pinch-me-I’m-dreaming astonishment to rival Helen Mirren’s triumphal awards season tour of 2007, when she was winning everything for her own queenly performance. Colman (Anne), Mirren (Elizabeth II), Dench (Elizabeth I) … Brits in crowns generally do it for the Academy.And there was justice in seeing Alfonso Cuarón picking up the best director, best cinematography and best foreign language Oscars for his magnificent artwork Roma. I have no problem with Spike Lee and his co-writers David Rabinowitz, Charlie Wachtel and Kevin Willmott picking up the award for best adapted screenplay for their fierce satire BlacKkKlansman. (Although I think I might have preferred to see Nicole Holofcener and Jeff Whitty get it for Can You Ever Forgive Me?) The 2019 Oscar prize list was speckled with honourable wins.Green Book isn’t a bad film, and it is possible to overindulge one’s high cinephile disdain. Mahershala Ali (winner for best supporting actor) and Viggo Mortensen give very slick and technically accomplished performances as the African-American jazz musician and composer Don Shirley and Tony Vallelonga, the Italian-American nightclub bouncer who finds himself driving Shirley through a tricky tour of the 1960s deep south. Ali’s performance is extremely elegant: he has the command and address of a classical actor in a classical role. But – to quote another of the night’s winners – this really is shallow stuff, which in another, sterner universe would be straight-to-video. Its well-intentioned whiteblack balance is glib.The other truly mystifying triumph this year is Bohemian Rhapsody, the story of Freddie Mercury and Queen, a project clouded by its association with its disgraced director Bryan Singer. Now, whatever else might be wrong with this film, it isn’t Rami Malek’s likable, spirited and now Oscar-winning performance: the impersonation of Mercury that he carried off with great elan. However, it has to be said that he wasn’t as good as the other four nominees: Christian Bale for Vice, Bradley Cooper for A Star Is Born, Willem Dafoe for At Eternity’s Gate and indeed Viggo Mortensen for Green Book.But for this moderate film to have been such a big winner, even picking up the Oscar for editing (as well as sound editing and sound mixing), really seems very silly. As with Green Book, it feels as if the Academy has reached into the bargain bin of those video stores that no longer exist, the bin just by the till, and capriciously plucked out a couple of also-rans for glory.It was, however, great to see Regina King win best supporting actress for her delicate, luminously intelligent performance in Barry Jenkins’ If Beale Street Could Talk. Here is where the awards’ hive-mind consensus has got it right, and her success makes up a little for the way that this excellent film was overlooked this year.There was a time when we thought that Bradley Cooper’s version of A Star Is Born might win big this year. It is an excellent movie, which deserved an awful lot more than just best song – although the steamily passionate live performance that Lady Gaga and Cooper gave of Shallow tonight earned them the scene-stealer award and created a Twitter gagstorm about how their respective partners must be feeling.Elsewhere, it is difficult to question the resounding best animation win for Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, a brilliant film that future generations of cinephiles will be treasuring long after BoRhap has been forgotten. And there was a best documentary Oscar for the truly gasp-inducing Free Solo. It was good to see Hannah Beachler and Jay Hart win best production design for their amazing work on Black Panther.As ever, we have to hope that great movies such as, say, Debra Granik’s Leave No Trace, Lucrecia Martel’s Zama, and Lee Chang-dong’s Burning will survive their hurtful snubs, and concentrate on the success of Roma – although even here I have a twinge that Cold War, directed by Paweł Pawlikowski and produced by Tanya Seghatchian, did not get the moment of glory that it deserved.Yet Roma is a wonderful film, a thrilling journey into the past, all but defying gravity in its staggering set pieces and crowd-scene choreography with profoundly mysterious and moving moments. It is superbly acted, unbearably moving and visually electrifying. It is the evening’s real winner."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5b7f29a01bf0333caadbba828c0fddb725e3efa/0_110_2285_1370/master/2285.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46b967d8e44394785f9d4a41b9b689e6","title":"oscars 2019 saves shocks for last with wins for green book and olivia colman","story":"The feelgood comedy drama was a surprise big winner, while Olivia Colman and Rami Malek took home top acting honoursOscars 2019 verdict: lovely surprises can’t compensate for shock horrorsGreen Book has been named best picture in a surprise victory over Roma, during an Oscars ceremony that lacked a host but was filled with ersity and historic wins.The feelgood comedy drama, starring Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen and directed by Peter Farrelly, had been dogged by problems during awards season, and some people have questioned the veracity of its supposed true story, about the friendship between pianist Don Shirley and his chauffeur Tony Lip.Ali also took home the award for best supporting actor, dedicating his win to Shirley, whose family have come out against the film’s portrayal of him. The actor, who also won for Moonlight in 2017, has become the first black man to win the best supporting actor award more than once. Green Book also won the Oscar for best original screenplay.Roma, the intimate Netflix drama that many had predicted would make Oscars history as the first foreign-language best picture winner, took home three awards, including best director for Alfonso Cuarón. Cuarón’s younger years inspired the film, which tells the story of a domestic worker’s relationship with the family who employs her. “As artists, our job is to look where others don’t,” Cuarón said. “This responsibility becomes even more important at times when we are told to look away.”Roma became Mexico’s first winner for best foreign language film, while Cuarón also picked up the award for best cinematography. The night was also a game-changing moment for Netflix, containing their biggest Oscar wins to date.In the night’s other big shock, predicted best actress winner Glenn Close lost out to Olivia Colman for her role as Queen Anne in Yorgos Lanthimos’s dark comedy The Favourite. “It’s genuinely quite stressful,” she said, arriving on stage. “This is hilarious – I’ve won an Oscar!” She thanked co-stars Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone, naming them “the two loveliest women in the world to go to work with”. Despite The Favourite entering the night with 10 nominations, it was the only award given to the film.Rami Malek was named best actor for playing Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody, following on from a string of other wins this awards season. He is the first Arab American to have won the best actor Oscar. “I may not have been the obvious choice but I guess it worked out,” the Mr Robot star said during his acceptance speech. He failed to mention the film’s credited director Bryan Singer, who was removed from the project and who has since been accused of numerous counts of sexual misconduct and sex with minors – though he denies all claims and has called them “a homophobic smear”. Bohemian Rhapsody also won awards for best editing, best sound editing and best sound mixing, and the winners in all these categories also avoided mention of Singer.Regina King picked up the best supporting actress award for her role in Barry Jenkins’ emotive drama If Beale Street Could Talk, beating Bafta winner Rachel Weisz. A tearful King paid tribute to both Jenkins and James Baldwin, whose 1974 novel the film is based on, calling him “one of the great artists of our time”.The night began with a performance by Queen, led by Adam Lambert, before the arrival of Amy Poehler, Tina Fey and Maya Rudolph, who answered some burning questions for viewers. “There is no host tonight, there won’t be a popular movie category tonight, and Mexico will not be paying for the wall,” Rudolph said. The trio then offered up an all-too-brief tease of what it would have looked like if they had been hosting. Apart from Melissa McCarthy and Brian Tyree Henry, who dressed up in a combination of elements from the year’s best costume design nominees to give the award, the night was free from skits, and played straighter than usual.It was a mostly apolitical night, without much mention of Donald Trump, although in presenting the award for best foreign language film, Javier Bardem started by saying, in Spanish: “There are no borders or walls that can restrain ingenuity or talent.” While accepting the award for best adapted screenplay for BlacKkKlansman, Spike Lee reminded Americans that the 2020 election is around the corner. “We must all mobilise, we must all be on the right side of history,” he said.Sony’s critically acclaimed Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse, which brought much-needed ersity to the Spider-Man universe, was named best animated feature, putting an end to Disney’s six-year hold on the category. “To our audience, we just want you to know that we see you,” said co-director Peter Ramsey. Elsewhere, Disney did win best animated short for Bao.Nominated for eight Oscars, A Star Is Born had to make do with only one win, for best original song. While accepting the award for Shallow, a tearful Lady Gaga said: “I’ve worked hard for a long time and it’s not about winning. What it’s about is not giving up. If you have a dream, fight for it.” The song was performed onstage by Gaga and Bradley Cooper earlier in the night, and received a standing ovation.The evening saw historic wins for Ruth Carter, the first black winner of the best costume design award, and Hannah Beachler, the first black winner of best production design, both for Black Panther. The Marvel film also won best original score for composer Ludwig Göransson, a longtime collaborator of director Ryan Coogler.The annual in memoriam section, this year scored by John Williams, remembered artists including Margot Kidder, Bernardo Bertolucci, Neil Simon, Burt Reynolds, Milos Forman, Penny Marshall, Stan Lee, William Goldman, Nicolas Roeg and Albert Finney, although character actor Dick Miller, known for work in Gremlins and The Terminator, was left out.“I can’t believe a film about menstruation just won an Oscar,” said director Rayka Zehtabchi, who took home the Oscar for best documentary short for Period. End of Sentence – beating the ’s contender Black Sheep. The Oscar for best documentary was awarded to Free Solo, the story of free-climber Alex Hannold.The 91st ceremony had been plagued with indecision and problems, from Kevin Hart’s history of homophobia leading to him stepping down as host, to the decision not to include an award for popular film, to the reversal of the announcement that four awards would take place in commercial breaks. The Academy had also stated that the ceremony would come in at a tidy three hours, yet it ran to almost three and a half."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a66a170e8b2654aca22428ea87c8075c14529147/770_70_2230_1337/master/2230.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=108aa1b28fe0588393cbe2e571a25fa2","title":"oscar winners 2019 the full list live","story":"All the winners from the 91st Academy Awards updated as it happensOscars 2019: the red carpet, the ceremony and the winners – live!Oscars red carpet 2019 in picturesBorderMary Queen of ScotsVice – WINNER!Free Solo – WINNER!Minding the Gap RBG Hale County This Morning, This EveningOf Fathers and SonsBlack Panther (Ruth E Carter) – WINNER!The Favourite (Sandy Powell)Mary Poppins Returns (Sandy Powell)Mary Queen of Scots (Alexandra Byrne)The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (Mary Zophres)The Favourite (Fiona Crombie and Alice Felton)First Man (Nathan Crowley and Kathy Lucas)Roma (Eugenio Caballero and Barbara Enriquez)Mary Poppins Returns (John Myhre and Gordon Sim)Black Panther (Hannah Beachler and Jay Hart) – WINNER!Incredibles 2 Ralph Breaks the Internet Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse – WINNER!Isle of Dogs MiraiBlack SheepEnd GameLifeboatA Night at the GardenPeriod.

Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud. I worked on this film to tell my story and hoped that it would resonate with people. To be nominated for this award is the highest recognition.”The film was produced by Simon Chinn and Jonathan Chinn of Lightbox (collaborator on the Whitney Houston documentary Whitney).

Be it melted cheese inside the fragile edges of a filo or puff pastry pie silky vegetables under a rough-textured crumble topping a dark and delicious gravy with Yorkshire pudding or buttercream held inside the crunchy case of a meringue. Each of the recipes in this month’s collection celebrates the delicious contrast of food that is both soft and crisp.The tart is best eaten fresh from the oven, while the cheese is still soft and melting. Before you start baking, place a pizza stone or metal baking sheet in the oven to heat up. Baking the tart on top of the hot sheet will ensure the base is crisp.You will need a metal baking dish or tart tin abut 30cm in diameter.Bring a large, deep pan of water to the boil. Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Slice each stem of purple sprouting broccoli in half lengthways. Finely shred the sprout tops. Lower the broccoli into the boiling water, cook for three or four minutes till the colour is bright then lift out with a draining spoon and refresh in a bowl of iced water. Do the same with the shredded sprout tops.Melt the butter in a small pan. Brush the base of a 30cm round baking tin with some of the butter, lay a sheet of pastry over the base and brush it with more butter Repeat with the remaining sheets of pastry and butter, letting them hang over the edges of the tin.Tear the taleggio into small pieces and grate the parmesan. Drain the vegetables and dry on kitchen paper. Fill the tart case with the drained sprouting broccoli and sprout tops, then tuck the taleggio among them and scatter with the grated parmesan. Fold the overhanging pastry back over the edges of the tart and place on the hot stone or baking sheet and bake for about 20-25 minutes till the pastry is crisp.A good cold weather supper, hearty but not heavy.

Put them into a deep casserole or saucepan with the butter, cover with a lid and let the leeks soften over a moderate heat. A regular stir will stop them colouring. Cut the tomatoes in half and stir into the softening leeks, together with salt and black pepper, letting them cook for about 10 minutes until soft and juicy. Stir in the basil leaves, then the cream. When the cream has warmed, remove from the heat and place the mixture in a baking dish. Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6.To make the crumble, put the flour in a large mixing bowl, add the butter and rub in with your fingertips. Stir in the grated cheese. Pull the leaves from the thyme and parsley, finely chop and stir in to the crumble. You can do this in seconds in a food processor.Sprinkle several drops of water over the crumble mixture and shake the bowl back and forth until you have large and small crumbs.

Peel the sweet potatoes, cut them into large pieces and steam for 10-15 minutes until tender. Remove from the steamer then mash with a potato masher or food mixer till smooth. Season with salt, the harissa paste and the ras el hanout and set aside to cool.Roll out the pastry to a rectangle measuring 23cm x 35cm, then transfer to a baking sheet, turning the pastry so the long side is facing you. Spoon the cooled sweet potato on the right-hand half, leaving a 2cm rim around the edge uncovered, then smooth the surface flat.Break the egg into a small bowl and beat lightly with a fork to mix yolk and white. Brush the bare edge generously with the beaten egg, then fold the left-hand side over the right, as if you were closing a book, and press firmly around the edges to seal.Score a trellis pattern on the top of the pastry then brush with more of the beaten egg. Scatter the black sesame seeds over the top then place on top of the empty baking sheet in the oven and bake for 40 minutes till golden brown.A batter pudding laden with chicken, sprouts and gravy.

Pour in the stock and bring to the boil, stirring regularly and scraping at the bottom of the pan to dissolve any tasty bits into the gravy. Lower the heat and simmer to a thickish consistency (too thin and it will pour out of your puddings). Generously season to taste and remove from the heat. Add the chicken meat to the gravy together with the thyme leaves and keep warm.Cut each sprout in half. Warm a little oil in a shallow pan then add the sprouts and the pieces of chicken skin.

By the end of this Carabao Cup final he had been transformed into something else, something more terminal had become instead the fool.Poor Sarri. For the preceding two hours his players had given the impression of playing for their manager, of a sense of unanimity. As the second half wound down Chelsea had the better, just about, of a scoreless game, with a feeling of something emerging, a shape beginning to clarify.In a moment of extra time in extra time that chimera fell away. Basically, Kepa Arrizabalaga refused to come off the pitch. He was substituted by his manager. But then he wasn’t. This was a substitution that became a non‑substitution, a substitution that was declined, swatted away with a swish of the glove.Three times Sarri approached the touchline and signalled for his goalkeeper to go. Next to him Willy Caballero stood awkwardly, looking at his feet, a lime-green gooseberry caught between his raging manager and a 23-year-old goalkeeper who refused to bow to the chain of command.Watching this it was impossible not to feel a curling of the toes. In the under-12s Arrizabalaga would have been led off by the referee or his mum. At Chelsea he stayed on, the world’s most expensive goalkeeper under a manager still paddling for air. How is this one going to play out?Afterwards Sarri was conciliatory. He handled it brilliantly in fact. He called the moment a misunderstanding, said that Arrizabalaga “was right, but in the wrong way”. Arrizabalaga had gone down with cramp, then recovered. Sarri saw that in retrospect Arrizabalaga was fine to stay on.Either way, to refuse to leave the pitch when ordered to go is unheard of. Certainly unheard of by Sarri, whatever he might say afterwards. He flailed his arms, screamed in rage, kicked things, wandered off almost down the tunnel. As the final whistle blew the manager was held back from engaging with his goalkeeper by Antonio Rüdiger.And in that moment the feeling of a ship whose captain had briefly resumed the wheel was pretty much dashed. So much about a shootout is to do with certainty and calm, the feeling that victory is at hand. Think of Gareth Southgate with his managing the manageables, planning every detail from the ring walk to who stands where. A stand-up row with a raging manager, a mutinous keeper, teammates keeping them apart: these aren’t quite the marginal gains we had in mind, Maurizio.Presumably Roman Abramovich was tuned in to all this, buffering his live feed in the cinema room of his super yacht somewhere near the equator. It is to be hoped Abramovich caught the rest of the game too, because until that moment his team had seemed to be getting somewhere. There had been a fear Chelsea might be eviscerated by Manchester City on this huge green spring-like pitch. Instead they grew into the game steadily, helped by selection and tactics that had a note of pragmatism when it mattered. For a man who never changes, Sarri changed here.The whole left side of his team, as brittle as a brandy snap in Manchester two weeks ago, was junked and replaced, albeit the first sight of Chelsea’s team caused a mass social-media sass at the sight of Eden Hazard as a false nine.At first glance this looked a fairly horrible decision, a case of spiking your own most powerful gun. But this was where Hazard had played when Chelsea beat City 2-0 at Stamford Bridge. More to the point, Sarri was also camouflaging a weakness.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsA system badly implemented is always a bad system, and at the Etihad Hazard had done a lot of standing around while the game happened quite near him. Marcos Alonso might not be the greatest defensive left-back. With no cover he looks like a man viewing the game through a film of extra thick custard. The change worked here. For a while nothing happened. Then nothing kept on happening. The shapes moved, coloured dots on a grid picked out against the green. The crowd chuntered and rumbled at the edge of things.Either way, 0-0 at half‑time felt like a step-up against the champions. And so it continued. On 51 minutes nothing happened. On 52 minutes nothing happened. On 53 minutes something happened. It was Hazard, finally getting away in his favoured left-hand channel. Kyle Walker has seen this movie before. Hazard went to cut inside, as he always cuts inside, but was crowded out.And as the game entered its final third it was Chelsea who were starting to carry the weight of the play. Win or lose, there would surely be solace here for Sarri, a sense of progress, of a team called to heel.At which point, enter Arrizabalaga. The Chelsea dressing room has been described as toxic, as a place where managers are flushed out, rat traps laid. This was gentle by comparison, and much worse, Arrizabalaga shooing his manager away as though bothered by a troublesome uncle.That City held their nerve and took the shootout was no surprise. This is a wonderful team, ticking off the first note of triumph in a season that could yet yield an astonishing bounty. For Chelsea it felt by the end like another note, albeit a comic one, in Sarri’s own drama of departure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f687fdda87007661323505adfea3baecedf9515/0_0_2480_1488/master/2480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f003a936e109af5d6773531fe3202895","title":"ten talking points from the weekend football","story":"Luke Shaw played a blinder but can still improve, Eden Hazard remains central to Chelsea and Deulofeu is coming of ageLeaving Gonzalo Higuaín on the bench until extra-time appeared bad faith in a big-name striker signed on an 18-month loan with attendant hefty wages. But with Eden Hazard as a central attacker, and Pedro and Willian flanking, Maurizio Sarri selected the trio who dug in for December’s 2-0 defeat of City. This display was as solid as Chelsea have looked since and Hazard was licensed to exhibit his inidual genius. The Belgian may be reluctant to play centrally but Sarri was in little position for taking a long-term view. With former manager José Mourinho, working as a TV pundit, unhelpfully reminding viewers of the broadcaster DAZN Spain that Hazard has “the talent and personality to wear the Real Madrid shirt”, Chelsea’s star may not be around beyond the short term. If Sunday was his final Wembley appearance for Chelsea, he graced the occasion his Panenka shootout penalty was an impudent beauty. John Brewin• Match report: Manchester City 0-0 Chelsea (City won 4-3 on pens)At half-time, Claudio Ranieri removed Ryan Sessegnon and Jean Michaël Seri: the latter because he might have otherwise been sent off, the former because the manager remains unconvinced by one of the brightest young talents in the country. Many things have gone wrong for Fulham this season, some of them out of their control, but the treatment of Sessegnon is increasingly curious. At 18 Sessegnon is not the answer to all their problems, but the issue is that he is not even being given the chance. Having set up their goal against West Ham with a forceful low cross and generally been their most threatening player, to take him off at the interval was baffling. It was hardly a surprise that, despite having the better of the second half, they could not create any clear chances, much less score a goal. Nick MillerOn the face of it, Wolves’ 1-1 draw at Bournemouth was a perfect advert for VAR. There were three dubious penalties and another that might have been given to Wolves for handball by Chris Mepham. But of the four, only Ivan Cavaliero’s foul on Ryan Fraser – which was outside the area, and might not have been a foul anyway – was close to the “clear and obvious error” that is theoretically required for a decision to be overturned. The rest were all subjective. Though VAR in the Premier League will increase the number of correct decisions, it will also heighten the sense of injustice at the debatable ones. Once technology is used, players have a much greater entitlement to the correct decision – or, rather, the decision they perceive to be correct. The issue was summed up by the Wolves head coach, Nuno Espírito Santo, when he was asked whether the reaction of his players to certain decisions showed they were hard done by. “I don’t know,” he said. “You cannot always trust the reaction of the players – sometimes they cheat.” The biggest problem with technology will always be humans. Rob SmythManchester City, having fallen apart this time last year from a similarly unbeaten starting point, have found the answer to staying competitive across the board and their blueprint may well be one Arsenal will pore over come the summer even if the Gunners stumble first across the finish line in the league. Arsenal have been bullish in their assertion that the league, and Champions League, have been their priority. Yet City have shown this season that compromising one trophy for another does not have to be a given. “We knew that we wanted to still be in the FA Cup, we’ve done that we wanted to stay top of the league, we’ve done that and to come here and win the third game of the week shows what a great squad we have, the great staff we have behind us and all the great work people don’t see,” said City’s captain, Steph Houghton. Suzanne Wrack• Match report: Manchester City 0-0 Arsenal (City won 4-2 on pens)When Southampton ended Arsenal’s 22-match unbeaten run on 16 December at St Mary’s – in Ralph Hasenhüttl’s second game in charge – it was a performance and occasion that teemed with intensity a clear example of a new-manager bounce. At the Emirates on Sunday, the most striking aspect of the club’s 2-0 defeat was their flatness and fragility. Hasenhüttl had enjoyed two clear weeks to prepare for it after the home loss to Cardiff but his team conceded the goals early on and fell apart. They could have leaked four or five by half-time. Inidual errors remain a massive problem and can Hasenhüttl legislate for those? But the broader picture is two points from an available 12 and a group of players that look inhibited. Hasenhüttl appeared to have the weight of the world on his shoulders afterwards. He has to find a way to unlock the tension.

VAR is not going to be wheeled out next season for every toss-of-a-coin line decision in the course of a game and in any case, given that there was still room for debate even after several slow-motion replays of Jan Vertonghen and Jeff Hendrick sliding over the line together, there was no clear and obvious mistake. Mike Dean’s decision became important in the context of the game because a goal resulted from the set piece, but VAR cannot be used in hindsight either. Even if an amount of guesswork on the part of the referee was necessarily involved, Tottenham should still have defended the corner better. Paul WilsonGerard Deulofeu has promised much but failed to deliver since his arrival on English shores with as a fresh-faced 18-year-old with Everton in 2013 – yet could he finally be coming of age after his dazzling hat-trick left Cardiff City stunned? Growing up in Lionel Messi’s shadow cannot be easy, especially after he was given one final shot at Camp Nou last season. But the shackles were off on Friday night as the Spaniard used the Cardiff City Stadium as his playground to lay bare Cardiff’s defensive frailties. Playing around Troy Deeney, his irrepressible movement terrified Sean Morrison and co, and he had the cool head and firepower to make his chances count. His maturity in front of goal allowed him to pick out the bottom corner before calmly finishing a pair of one-on-ones. So could this be the game where Deulofeu proved he is ready to become one of the Premier League’s better performers or will it prove to be another false dawn? James CandyRoy Hodgson celebrated becoming the oldest person to manage in the Premier League by witnessing his side dismantle Leicester. Having worked across Europe, Hodgson has learned how to get the best out of players of all styles and ages. The 71-year-old has finely tuned Wilfried Zaha since arriving at Selhurst Park, giving his star man the freedom he requires to earn points. There were another two goals for the winger on Saturday, making it the first time Zaha has scored in three consecutive Premier League games, earning praise from Hodgson who says Zaha is benefiting from concerted team effort to score more and, ironically, being liberated by having a central striker. Zaha proclaimed on Instagram: “Today’s win is for you gaffer,” alongside a photo of a smiling Hodgson. They might use different platforms to show their mutual admiration, but they are certainly getting the best out of each other. Will UnwinNewcastle fans welcomed Miguel Almirón to Tyneside with a special “Wor Almirón” banner and, in return, the £21m Paraguay playmaker brought searing pace, smart swivels and slick passes to the party. He and Salomón Rondón competed for man of the match honours, with the midfielders Sean Longstaff and Isaac Hayden not far behind. But one man’s influence should not be underestimated. Newcastle’s shaky start to the season coincided with Florian Lejeune being sidelined with a ruptured cruciate ligament but since the centre-half’s return they have improved appreciably. Lejeune is an excellent defender whose comfort on the ball, technical assurance and vision enables Rafael Benítez’s 5-4-1 formation to switch seamlessly to an attacking 3-4-3. His party trick is switching play courtesy of long diagonal passes and the latest example prefaced Rondón scoring the first goal against 10-man, all but relegated, Huddersfield.

He looked up, waited, looked up some more and eventually, having no other option, floated a long ball forward. Chris Smalling won the header against Sadio Mané and another Liverpool attack withered into nothingness. The impetus of November and December has ebbed away and although Liverpool still have the title in their own hands, there is a distinct sense that the momentum is now with Manchester City.There were specific frustrations here, given how United spent the entire first half in a blur of reorganisation, their technical area transformed into a triage station, but the truth is that, since the 5-1 win over Arsenal at the end of December, Liverpool have not played with the sort of attacking verve for which they have become renowned under Jürgen Klopp.There was the 3-0 win over Bournemouth, it’s true, but there may not be a better opponent for a top side to play, certainly at home: the game will always be open and is very unlikely to degenerate into a battle. This was a fourth draw in their past five games for Klopp’s side and only the second time they have failed to score in two successive games this season.There’s a tendency always to want what you do not have, to believe that the blanket is always slightly too small, but there have been times this season when Liverpool’s midfield has seemed distinctly functional. Nobody can realistically doubt that Liverpool did well from the sale of Philippe Coutinho, who wanted to go anyway, and whose fee helped pay for Virgil van Dijk, but equally there have been times this season when they have lacked a little of the invention he might have brought.That was particularly obvious, for instance, in the away games against Napoli and Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. Perhaps if Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had not been ruled out with a cruciate injury, he could have provided a little thrust, but the fact is that a team that set up with Henderson, Fabinho and Georginio Wijnaldum as their midfield three will always risk being a little lacking in guile.Which raises the question of how Liverpool last season, even after Oxlade-Chamberlain had suffered his knee injury, never seemed so flat as this. The answer perhaps lies in pressing, which Klopp once declared the greatest playmaker in the world. Play high up the pitch, keep the opponent under constant pressure and mistakes will be made and chances will come. It was a theory that had worked for Klopp at Mainz and at Borussia Dortmund and was doing so at Liverpool as well.The problem was that it came at a cost. Liverpool finished last season in a state of exhaustion, their squad stretched to the absolute maximum. It didn’t take Raymond Verheijen to diagnose the problem – although the Dutch coach did, repeatedly, on social media. Liverpool were running too hard. So Klopp took the logical step of easing back. Liverpool have, by and large, not pressed with anything like the same intensity this season. The result has been fewer injuries and an improved defence, but the change of approach has also highlighted the lack of midfield flair since the departure of Coutinho.None of which would necessarily matter were the front three firing as they did in those final months of last season. But they are not.Roberto Firmino has been struggling with a virus recently and left Old Trafford on crutches after sustaining an ankle injury. Mohamed Salah has seemed oddly out of sorts in recent weeks, at times bafflingly so, like Billy in one of those frequent periods in which his magic boots had gone missing. Mané, with four goals in successive games before the draw against Bayern, has been left to carry the burden, but given how deep United played, there was never likely to be space behind the defensive line that he could attack with his pace.But to speak of iniduals, perhaps, is to miss the point. The interaction between the front three is not what it was. There is not the same sense of a telepathic understanding. In part that’s to do with opponents sitting deep so the opportunities for those thrilling sweeping counters are diminished, but only in part. A tentativeness has crept into Liverpool’s attacking play that has ramifications across the pitch.If the movement is not so slick as it should be, there are fewer targets for Henderson to hit, which perhaps explains why so often he resorted to hitting it long. Klopp spent most of the game in a fury, and Henderson pointedly snubbed him after being substituted, suggesting that he felt a disproportionate amount of the criticism had been directed at him or that he was frustrated at being the player to make way for Xherdan Shaqiri.The Switzerland international can bring a spark, as he did in turning United’s game at Anfield this season Liverpool’s way, but by the end the visitors ended up with Daniel Sturridge and Divock Origi up front, trying to pick them out with aerial balls.A draw at Old Trafford can never be a poor result and if City lose here it will look a very good one. But the bigger issue for Liverpool is perhaps more the performance and the general lack of penetration."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b419a756b65cb5c3905d7f42718d782666a295bf/0_0_2317_1672/master/2317.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0e7444ca8a2c5b016d4fe4592b8d171e 960w","title":"sous vide juicers and toasters the best kitchen appliances to buy","story":"From space-saving cooking solutions to future-facing chefs’ toys, here’s a selection of gadgets to make your kitchen life easierCheck out our discount codes and vouchersA sous vide is one of those chef’s toys you might have always wanted but haven’t been able to justify either the cost or the counter-top space in the kitchen … until now.

What will they want and what will they give away, bin or recycle? You can make their task easier by dealing with your possessions now, instead of foisting it on to them.In just about everyone’s house or office, certain areas become magnets for clutter: the dining-room table, the chest of drawers in the hallway, a chair in the bedroom – not to mention, the “floordrobe”. Clutter tends to accumulate, so make an effort to clear those areas every night.While it can be helpful to have more than one phone charger or pair of scissors, you probably don’t need two flour sifters and three pen cups. It’s often easier to keep track of one item than it is of several – when you have only one pair of sunglasses, you may find that they are always to hand.When we see objects settled into a particular place over time, it becomes hard to imagine where else they might go – so put your clutter into a new context. Gather up items in a box and carry it to a well-ordered room. Once you remove things from the places in which they have settled, it becomes much easier to decide what to do with them.If you can’t decide whether to keep an item of clothing, ask yourself: “Would I be happy to run into my ex wearing this?”Yes, you went to that conference and got a branded mug, T-shirt, water bottle, journal and pen. But if you don’t have a clear plan to use these things, they are clutter, and can end up taking up a lot of time, energy and space. The best way to deal with freebies is to never accept them in the first place.These items may seem wonderful when you’re on holiday, but will you really want to put them on your shelves when you get home? If you love to buy souvenirs, consider acquiring items that are small, useful or easy to display, and yet good at conjuring memories, such as Christmas tree ornaments, cooking spices, charms for a bracelet and postcards.Outer Order, Inner Calm: Declutter and Organize to Make More Room for Happiness by Gretchen Rubin is published by Two Roads on 7 March"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daf06f3312f99c278700ca3f397033479c9ac579/0_77_5720_3432/master/5720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78e56926aabb0350cafaa217a56b8c89","title":"guardian supporters future journalism","story":"By opting for a reader-funded business model, we rely on readers to support our groundbreaking independent journalism.

Some of them say we are not to be trusted because they think we are going to use the backstop to keep them in the EU forever, but if you look at the confusion, you can see precisely why the backstop is necessary,” said an insider.There is also disquiet that Ireland will be scapegoated for no deal when member states believe the country is being used as a proxy to tease out positions on future trade talks. For this reason “any attempt to blame the Irish for no deal will backfire,” said a source.There is also bewilderment that the recent flurry of meetings in Brussels involving May’s Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, and the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, are being characterised in London as “negotiations” when the reality is the EU is still waiting for the prime minister to show them the alternative arrangements for the Irish backstop for which she claims to have a majority in support.The frustration being felt in Brussels was evident after Cox arrived in Brussels with no concrete proposals. “We are still in wait-and-see mode. There is a feeling that Britain is overplaying how things are going,” said an insider.One senior EU diplomat said May was to blame for failing to confront hardline Eurosceptic Tories. “She gave the impression that you can stay in your delusional comfort zone, but you can’t,” the diplomat said. “Unless she is ready to choose there is nothing we can do.”Concerns emerged as May flew in to the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheik for an EU-Arab league of states summit on Sunday, and confirmed she would not be putting a revised Brexit deal to the Commons this week. Even so she insisted that it “within our our grasp to leave the EU by 29 March and that is what we are planning to do”.May said she would instead put the deal to parliament on 12 March and brushed off the calls by three cabinet ministers – Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Greg Clark – for a no-deal scenario to be ruled out.“What we see around the cabinet table are strong views on the issue of Europe,” she said. “What we are doing as a government is ensuring we are doing everything we can to leave the European Union with a deal.“People are talking about the extension of article 50 as if it solves the issue when of course it won’t. It defers the point of decision. There comes a point when we must make that decision.”There is growing support, however, among MPs for an amendment due to be tabled this week by the former Labour and Conservative cabinet ministers Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin, which would instruct May to seek an extension of article 50 if she does not have a deal ratified by 13 March.As he arrived at the summit in Egypt, Sebastian Kurz, the Austrian chancellor, offered his support for a delay to Brexit given the impasse in the negotiations.“If by the beginning of March there’s no support for the deal then I think it would be good to postpone Brexit because a no-deal scenario is bad for the EU but extremely bad for the UK,” Kurz told reporters.EU officials are understood to be looking at options if such an extension request is received: a three-month “technical” extension to allow extra time for ratification if the parliamentary process develops positively, or a longer prolongation of nine to 21 months should there be no clear way to break the current impasse.A source close to the European council president, Donald Tusk, said that as a request had yet to be made by Downing Street, the issue had not been discussed by leaders. “No Tusk position on this,” the official said of the mooted 21-month extension. “At this stage, at least.”But sources said the EU was determined to avoid a series of three-month extension requests by the UK, which would cause damaging uncertainty, leaving Brussels unable to plan for the future.The emergence of the idea of a 21-month delay to Brexit will be seen by some as an attempt to push Brexiter MPs into backing May’s deal.The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barner, had advised ambassadors last week that the threat of a lengthy extension could be used by May as leverage in talks with her Brexiter MPs as she seeks to nudge the deal through parliament.May is meanwhile driving on with seeking legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement to reassure Brexiters of the temporary nature of the Irish backstop, which would keep the UK in a customs union to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.The prime minister updated Tusk during a 30-minute meeting at the summit in Egypt on her plans for the meaningful vote. “No tensions,” an EU source said. “Focus on practicalities.”Tusk was said to have told May that the EU would have “clarity that a proposal for the way forward can command a majority in the UK, before the issue is tackled by the European council”.The Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, who will hold talks with May on Monday in Egypt, dismissed claims made earlier on Sunday by Michael Gove, the environment secretary, that a time limit or unilateral exit mechanism from the Irish backstop could still emerge from the talks.“A backstop that includes a time-limit is not a backstop at all. Nor would a unilateral exit clause work for us,” Varadkar said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/470a3883a294323988efb0f9868895fac19e488f/0_743_2476_1485/master/2476.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e56aa63040c534e825dd805202f8850","title":"theresa may dismisses pressure to step down as pm after brexit","story":"May insists she will stay on after delaying ‘meaningful vote’ on revised exit dealTheresa May has insisted that she will stay on in Downing Street beyond Brexit despite pressure from cabinet colleagues to step down, after she angered MPs by conceding that there would be no “meaningful vote” this week on a revised withdrawal deal.The prime minister sparked a fierce backlash on Sunday by admitting that the vote may now not be held before 12 March because her team are still negotiating with EU officials on changes to the deal that she hopes will reassure MPs.“My team will be back in Brussels on Tuesday. As a result of that, we won’t bring a meaningful vote to parliament this week, but we will ensure that that happens by 12 March,” she said. “But it’s still within our grasp to leave the EU by the 29 March, and that is what we are planning to do.”The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, said: “This decision to further delay the meaningful vote is the height of irresponsibility and an admission of failure. Parliament cannot stand by and allow this to happen.”Cabinet ministers told the  last week that they expected the prime minister to stand down after the local elections in May, and Brexiters would like to see a successor more sympathetic to their case to take over the next stage of the negotiations.Speaking en route to Sharm El Sheikh, however, where she is attending a summit of the EU and the Arab League, May insisted that she wished to remain in Downing Street to pursue her domestic agenda, including major health reforms. “I was very clear in December with the Conservative party that my job is not just to deliver Brexit. There is also a domestic agenda that I am delivering on that reflects what I said when I was on the doorstop of No 10 when I first became prime minister.“That is why we have been making key decisions such as extra money for the National Health Service and the long-term plan for the NHS.” Asked if she would resign by Christmas, she refused to reply.May told Conservative MPs before the confidence vote in December that she would stand aside before 2022, and later made it clear that she intended to contest any snap election.In a further challenge to her authority, three cabinet ministers – Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and David Gauke – have publicly threatened to defy her in the Commons this week by backing efforts to extend article 50 if no deal is agreed by mid-March.While there will be no meaningful vote this week, MPs will be offered another chance on Wednesday to vote on a government motion and, crucially, to amend it to bind May’s hands by trying to prevent a no-deal Brexit.Yvette Cooper, the co-signatory of the Cooper-Letwin bill, which could win the backing of scores of ministers, said: “The prime minister’s last-minute announcement that she won’t put a deal to parliament this week, and is leaving it until just two weeks before Brexit day, is utterly shambolic and irresponsible.“The prime minister is still committed to an amendable motion on Brexit next week, so our cross-party group will be tabling a paving amendment to vote on this week in order to get the bill through.”May refused to condemn the three cabinet ministers speaking out against a no-deal Brexit. “I have recognised and others have recognised that there are strong views that are held on this issue. What we are collectively doing as a government and as a cabinet is working to get that deal,” she said.“Parliament wants to see changes to the backstop. We have been working with the EU on that. Our focus is on leaving with a deal. My intention is to work with a deal.”The announcement of the further delay to the meaningful vote infuriated business groups, which have been keenly awaiting confirmation that a deal has been agreed. Edwin Morgan, the interim director general of the Institute of Directors, said: “There is too much at stake to run down the clock and risk an accidental no-deal. We sincerely hope this is the last and final date change.“The prime minister must make absolutely clear ahead of time what the government’s next steps will be if the vote fails again. Businesses have lost all faith in the political process, and as those first in the firing line of no-deal, they deserve to know more.”The environment secretary, Michael Gove, earlier urged his cabinet colleagues not to back a Commons vote on delaying Brexit. He said Clark, Rudd and Gauke supporting the bid, which would push back the UK’s exit date of 29 March, would be “the wrong thing to do”.Following a torrid week in which three female MPs resigned the Conservative whip after claiming that the party had been taken over by Brexit extremists, May was forced to respond to claims from one defector, Anna Soubry, that she had “a problem with immigration.”May said: “No. As I have consistently said, immigration has been good for this country. What people wanted to see is to ensure that decisions about who is welcomed to this country are taken by the UK government and are not taken by others elsewhere.” May will make a statement to MPs on Tuesday in a last-ditch bid to prevent her own ministers from voting for Cooper-Letwin and defeating the government. A Whitehall source said: “The clock is ticking and no deal is unacceptable, so we will listen carefully to what the PM has to say.”Soubry, one of the three who joined the breakaway Independent Group last week, said: “No surprise she’s nothing to bring back because the EU will not reopen the withdrawal agreement. We know this to be the case, because when she came back with it, that’s what she said. This is it, it’s as good as it gets, and the negotiations are over. What a dreadful, avoidable mess.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a876cd9f4a8a22124fc62e262b7f19f6b081ebf8/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=591ec7b35393aebb3e6204081fb030cc","title":"brexit tobias ellwood minister hints that theresa may might extend article 50","story":"Tobias Ellwood also says he is ‘tempted’ to vote against PM if she does not delay BrexitThe defence minister Tobias Ellwood has hinted that Theresa May could be poised to propose an extension to article 50 and confirmed that if she does not, he is “tempted” to vote for a delay to Brexit.“I don’t support the idea that we go ahead towards no deal,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.Over the weekend three cabinet minsters demanded the prime minister stop using the threat of a no-deal Brexit as a negotiating tactic.On Wednesday an amendment is due to be tabled by former Labour and Conservative cabinet ministers Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin, which would instruct May to seek an extension of article 50 if she does not have a deal ratified by 13 March.May is due to update the Commons on Brexit on Tuesday after her return from talks with other EU leaders in Egypt.Asked if she could announce an extension to article Ellwood said: “You need to wait and hear what she has to say when she gets back.”Pressed to clarify whether he knew a delay would be announced, Ellwood said: “That I don’t know. I’m encouraging that to happen because it is not in anybody’s interest to see no deal affecting Britain in the way that we are talking about.”Asked if we would back the CooperLetwin amendment, Ellwood said he was “tempted” but added “much will happen” before the vote.Ellwood also echoed some of the criticisms of the hard-Brexit-backing European Research Group voiced last week by three former Tory MPs after defecting from the party.Ellwood said the prime minister had done her “utmost to appease the ERG”. He added: “The actual referendum itself was done with them in mind. The article 50 letter was sent with them in mind. The motions have been delayed and written with the ERG in mind.“It’s now important for them to fall in line. We would not be having this conversation about no deal if it wasn’t for the fact that, I’m afraid, there’s been a bloc voice in our party that has hindered the prime minister getting this across the line.”Members of the ERG are relaxed about the prospects of a no-deal Brexit, but Ellwood set out the case against. He said: “Does it responsibly answer the referendum question? No it doesn’t. Does it domestically help a ided nation on the Brexit issue? No it doesn’t. And does it help Britain’s prosperity in moving to WTO terms? No it doesn’t. This is not good for Britain. In fact it is out of character for an internationally engaged country with an aspiration to help shape the world to actually move in this direction.”Damian Hinds, the education secretary, insisted that Brexit would not be delayed. Speaking to ITV’s Good Morning Britain, he said: “It is going to happen on the 29 March.”“There is a very good deal on the table. There are some legitimate concerns about the backstop in terms of the timing and so on. And it is important to get those resolved, but yes that is what we are doing.”Later on the Today programme he said that delaying the UK’s departure from the EU would only prolong the uncertainty. “Much better to go on and do it,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e8d7fb25ec012faf430fdae7f25d1d63803f212/0_48_3558_2135/master/3558.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ce7480fdd2e235849c1fc6978b80475","title":"brexit latest news developments theresa may increasingly likely to accept article 50 extension minister suggests politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happen, including Theresa May’s press conference at the EU-Arab summit in Sharm El SheikhThese are from the BBC’s Ros Atkins, who has been interviewing the Polish prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, at the EU-Arab summit in Sharm El Sheikh.This is what the Press Association has filed from the government briefing about Theresa May’s meeting with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, this morning.The prime minister is meeting European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday as part of her talks with EU leaders in Sharm El Sheikh, a senior UK government official said. The official said May had a “good, friendly” 45-minute meeting with Merkel on the fringes of the EU-League of Arab States summit they are attending. The PM and Merkel discussed Brexit and the UK parliament, as well as issues like Syria, the official said.The issue of extending article 50 came up briefly in the meeting, and May reiterated that the UK wanted to leave the EU with a deal on the scheduled date of March 29, the official said.Referring to the PM’s meeting with Merkel, the UK government official said: “They did discuss Brexit, they discussed UK parliament, things that have been happening in UK parliament, things that are happening this week. “They spent a decent amount of time talking about foreign policy as well as Brexit.” The official said the issue of extending article 50 came up “fleetingly”, adding “it really wasn’t a focus”.Here is my colleague Matthew Weaver’s story on Tobias Ellwood, the defence minister, hinting that Theresa May could back an extension of article 50.Jon Lansman, the Momentum founder and member of Labour’s national executive committee who is one of Jeremy Corbyn’s most long-standing allies, told the Today programme this morning that he thought Labour had underestimated the extent of antisemitism on the party. Lansman, who is Jewish, said:I do think we have a major problem and it always seems to me that we underestimate the scale of it. I think it is a widespread problem. I think it is now obvious that we have a much larger number of people with hardcore antisemitic opinions which unfortunately is polluting the atmosphere in a lot of constituency parties and in particular online. We have to deal with these people.Lansman said the extent of the problem in the party was partly a reflection of its size - 300,000 new members joined after Corbyn became leader - and partly a reflection of its age profile. He explained: There are conspiracy theorists in many parts of the political spectrum, I don’t think it’s exclusive to the Labour party.The Tory party is a smaller party and an elderly party and the role of social media in fomenting and spreading some of the poison is therefore more of a problem in the Labour party.But he said he did not accept the claim from Luciana Berger, who left Labour to join the Independent Group last week largely because of the antisemitic abuse she has received, that Labour was “institutionally antisemitic”.And Lansman also said he did not agree with the suggestion from Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, that Corbyn should personally review some antisemitism complaints himself. Lansman said:Jeremy Corbyn has been an anti-racist campaigner all his life, I have known him for decades and I do absolutely believe in his commitment to eradicate that.I think he is overseeing the party’s battle against antisemitism. I’m not sure about him taking personal responsibility for cases. I think if he did that, some people might argue that that would be inappropriate.The 11 MPs in the new Independent Group are holding their first private group meeting in Westminster later today. There has been speculation that they could choose a leader. Chuka Umunna, the former Labour MP, said yesterday that he wanted to play “the biggest role” in the group, so by the end of the day he could be a leader - although not a party leader, because TIG are not a party yet.Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem deputy leader, told the today programme that her party (which, coincidentally, also has 11 MPs) wanted to work with the new group. She said:I think we need to be working together with the Independent Group MPs but we need to find a 2019 way of doing that and I’m open-minded about how that looks. I want to approach this with a very very open mind, potentially to have radical change. It is not very often we get a moment to break up the broken political system and we have that moment now.She also suggested the the Lib Dems could agree a pact with the new group that would see them not standing candidates against each other. When asked if this was an option, she replied:I don’t think we should be taking any of these things off the table ...I will welcome anyone to the Liberal Democrats who shares my liberal values, and obviously I want more people to join the Lib Dems.But I am not going to be petty about this and suggest that I am not going to work with somebody who shares many of my values just because for whatever reason they don’t feel that they can join my party.Theresa May is under growing pressure to agree to extend article 50. Perhaps the clearest evidence that she is coming close to embracing the idea came from May herself yesterday, when she told reporters on her plane as she flew out to the EU-Arab summit in Sharm El Sheikh that “it’s still within our grasp to leave the EU by the 29 March.” She used to assert as fact, without qualification, that Britain would be out at the end of March. Now it is just “within our grasp” - a phrase more typically applied to political aspirations that have little chance of being realised, like ending child poverty.But this morning there are three more developments suggesting that May is getting ever closer to embracing the need to extend article 50.1) The Daily  (paywall) reports that Number 10 has drawn up contingency plans to extend article 50 for two months. In a story that is not being denied by government sources, who point out that you would expect the government to have contingency plans for all eventualities, Steven Swinford and Anna Mikhailova report:Brexit will be delayed for up to two months under plans being considered by Theresa May to extend Article 50, the  has learned.Downing Street officials have drawn up a series of options in a bid to avoid resignations by ministers determined to support a backbench bid to take no deal off the table this week ...While the Downing Street plans do not specify the length of the extension, ministers believe it will be no longer than two months - avoiding the need for the UK to participate in European parliament elections.On Wednesday the Commons will vote on a backbench bill tabled by Yvette Cooper, a senior Labour MP, that would force Mrs May to request an extension of Article 50 if a deal has not been reached by March 13.The prime minister could avert a rebellion by Tory MPs and a Commons defeat by committing to requesting a Brexit delay herself, although in doing so risks alienating Eurosceptic Tory MPs. “It’s very finely balanced,” a source said.2) The Conservative MP Simon Hart, with the support of members of the Brexit Delivery Group (Tories who want to deliver Brexit, while avoiding no deal), has drawn up an amendment for the Brexit vote on Wednesday that would allow MPs to vote for a plan to avoid no deal without having to pass a new law, as the Yvette Cooper amendment proposes. This would be more acceptable to Number 10 than Cooper, the FT reports (paywall):Under the proposal, which is set to be tabled as an amendment on Wednesday, the government would be legally obliged to offer MPs the option of requesting an extension in the article 50 exit process beyond March 29. EU leaders have said they are likely to agree to some form of extension, but Mrs May has said she will not ask for one. A counterproposal, led by Conservative MPs Simon Hart and Andrew Percy, would delay Brexit day to May 23, the start of the European parliament elections, if parliament in Westminster has not approved a deal by March 12. In an email to 50 members of the Brexit Delivery Group of moderate Tory MPs, Mr Hart said the amendment “could offer some colleagues who have indicated they might support Letwin-Cooper a way out, whilst also removing the danger of a crashing out at the end of March without a deal”. The plan seeks to avoid “the constitutional upheaval” of the Cooper amendment, and therefore win Downing Street’s support. But as a result, it does not set out legislative moves to tie the government’s hands. “It is just an expression of opinion,” said Sir Oliver. 3) Tobias Ellwood, a defence minister and one of those Tories in government who has hinted that he would vote for Cooper to avoid the risk of a no-deal Brexit, told the Today programme this morning that he thought May might announce an article 50 extension herself. May was “listening” to the concerns of MPs about no deal, he said. Asked if she could announce an article 50 extension after her return from talks with other EU leaders in Egypt, he replied: You need to wait and hear what she has to say when she gets back. That, I don’t know. I’m encouraging that to happen because it’s not in anybody’s interest to see no deal.He also said that May should be willing to defy Tory Brexiters in the European Research Group on this point. (The ERG think it would be a mistake to rule out a no-deal Brexit.) Ellwood said:It’s now important for them to fall in line. We would not be having this conversation about no deal if it wasn’t for the fact that, I’m afraid, there’s been a bloc voice in our party that has hindered the prime minister getting this across the line. She may get the necessary concessions and legal agreements concerning the backstop, but, ultimately, the clock is ticking down. If we cannot get this deal across the line, we are facing the prospect of having to extend.Ellwood’s interview gave some journalists the impression that he knew more about what might happen than he was actually letting on. This is from HuffPost’s Paul Waugh.And this is from PoliticsHome’s Kevin Schofield.Here is the agenda for the day.9am (UK time): Theresa May’s press spokesman is due to brief journalists on May’s meetings with Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, and Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, this morning on the margins of the EU-Arab summit in Sharm El Sheikh.10am: The Bank of England holds a press conference. 2.30pm: Sajid Javid, the home secretary, takes questions in the Commons.As usual, I will also be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, but I expect to be focusing mostly on the Brexit debate, and any further fall-out from last week’s defections from Labour and the Conservative party.

Eubank, operating faithfully to the instructions of his new American trainer, Nate Vasquez, could have done little more, although it was an ugly spectacle.DeGale, whose quirky, disjointed style has frustrated so many opponents, was vulnerable for worryingly long stretches, unsteady on wobbling legs, and his only achievement was to finish upright under a final onslaught in the closing round, surely his last at the end of a tough, garlanded career.He cannot renege on his pre-fight pledge to walk away if he lost “to someone like Eubank”. He did not just lose: he was schooled – as Eubank had claimed of their sparring in 2012.DeGale will find it difficult to quit the sport that has been his life, as he revealed in his reluctance in the immediate aftermath to acknowledge that it is all over. But it would be folly to continue, for his pride and his well-being.As for Eubank, he is in the mix now to contemplate bigger challenges against younger, more dangerous opponents. A logical test would be against the unbeaten Liverpudlian Callum Smith, who holds the more respected WBA version of the super-middleweight title and sent George Groves into retirement.As ever, boxing politics will interfere with those negotiations if Eubank’s father could somehow make a mouthwatering challenge against Golovkin impossible in 2016, prospects for a domestic showdown with Smith are probably not much better.Groves, who was ringside on Saturday, had picked Eubank to beat DeGale (as he had done himself in 2012, as well as getting the better of Eubank last year), and said of his own decision to retire after losing to Smith: “You just know when it’s time to go.”It echoed the words many years ago of the world featherweight champion Barry McGuigan: “A fighter is always the first to know when to quit, and the last to admit it.”Eubank’s only current dilemma is how to work his way through the thick jungle of his sport’s labyrinthian complications. If a Smith fight is not immediately a possibility, he could chase down the 34-year-old American Anthony Dirrell, who won the vacant WBC belt by beating Avni Yildirim in Minneapolis on Saturday night in controversial circumstances, awarded the decision on a technicality when leading through 10 rounds after being accidentally cut in a collision with the tough Turk, who lost to Eubank in three rounds two years ago.Dirrell’s younger, fresher compatriot Caleb Plant, the IBF champion, is another who might figure in discussions. For now, Eubank can be well pleased with the most convincing performance of his career. As Vasquez says, he has work still to do, but his strength, speed and heavy hitting have elevated him to a level where he could prosper. It is up to him, though, not his father – and they both know that."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab2ecb2b0402464abfd66a60b491fdf447cd20f/509_856_3671_2204/master/3671.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dab0278f8ef5811cb792173cc52ea36f","title":"equus review peter shaffer horse blinding theatre royal stratford east london ned bennett","story":"Theatre Royal Stratford East, LondonNed Bennett brilliantly directs the landmark 1973 play about a teenager who has blinded horsesI’ve often complained about the move towards a directors’ theatre. But directors can also renew a familiar work – which is precisely what Ned Bennett does in his exhilarating staging of Peter Shaffer’s modern classic. I was present at the first performance in 1973 but, without violating the text, Bennett’s production has enabled me to see the play through fresh eyes.Shaffer shows a psychiatrist, Martin Dysart, attempting to discover what drove a teenage boy, Alan Strang, to blind six horses with a metal spike: it is not so much a whodunnit as a why-did-he-do-it? Dysart patiently explores Alan’s parental background – a puritanical father, an obsessively religious mother – and the boy’s preoccupation with horses. But, while Dysart envies the boy’s capacity for worship, he only gets to the truth when he tricks Alan into reliving the events of the night of the blinding.Shaffer’s published stage directions are modelled on John Dexter’s original production: “the actors wear tracksuits of chestnut velvet” and “tough masks of silver wire and leather”. But Bennett, designer Georgia Lowe and movement director Shelley Maxwell have totally reimagined this. The opening image is of Ethan Kai’s Alan nuzzling a horse in the shape of Ira Mandela Siobhan, who sports grey shorts and reveals a muscular torso. The eroticism of the relationship pays off later when Alan orgasmically bestrides the horse in question, Nugget, and when that memory intrudes on his attempt to have sex with a stable-girl. An idea latent in Shaffer’s text, of Alan’s equine fixation as a metaphor for same-sex love, is made explicit in Bennett’s production.The play’s difficulty lies with Dysart. Alec McCowen played him brilliantly in the original production as a desiccated rationalist with a hunger for ecstasy.Zubin Varla takes a different, and equally valid approach by suggesting that Dysart is just as disturbed as his patient. Varla smokes compulsively, his body is a mass of nervous tics and, when he tells Alan that he had a dream of carving up children, you feel he is not entirely joking. I’ve always felt there was something excessive about Dysart’s self-loathing, but here his regrets about returning Alan to a world of supposed normality take on a different meaning: it is as if he feels guilty not just for destroying his passion but for altering his sexual orientation.The whole production, however, has a different feel to it from the original. What is usually a play for two stars, depicting Shaffer’s familiar battle between reason and instinct, becomes an ensemble piece for eight actors who double as people and horses. There is especially good work from Ruth Lass as a kindly magistrate seeking to stave off Dysart’s breakdown, Robert Fitch as Alan’s oppressive father, Syreeta Kumar as his Bible-quoting mother and Norah Lopez Holden as his would-be lover.

But for those hoping to get away for a week or two in the sun either then or during the summer, the prospect of a no-deal in Britain’s departure from the European Union could trigger a much more expensive holiday, amid expectations that sterling would plummet in value against the euro.So with so much instability ahead, should consumers bank their euros in advance of the holidays?As always with currency markets, however, there is no exact science and the reactions of politicians and banking figures will be key.James Hickman from currency trader FairFx says: “A lot of it is down to the rhetoric that politicians and the Bank of England put on it, such as how hard will a no-deal Brexit impact growth. There are a lot of forecasts out there but the truth is no one really knows.Earlier this month, during a speech in which he urged MPs to find a solution to the impasse, Carney said no deal would result in an “economic shock” for Britain.The drop in value of sterling since the vote has reduced the spending power of the British tourist. For every £1,000 of holiday money you might take to Spain, Italy or other eurozone countries, you get almost €130 less than before the vote – at today’s rates.Andrew Brown from Post Office Travel Money says the average British tourist spends £800 on a break. If the worst-case scenarios do bear out, this could mean a no-deal would add an average £80.While the rates may be poor compared to what has gone before, and there is the possibility that they may improve, buying currency now does give some peace of mind.“I think security is much better than speculation,” says Hickman. “Most holidaymakers wouldn’t book without knowing exactly what it is going to cost and speculating what might go up and what might go down.“For peace of mind, I don’t think there’s a downside to buying at least part of your holiday money now.”There are a number of ways to “hedge” or bank currency now in advance of whatever may come over the next month. Easiest is to use a comparison tool such as MoneySavingExpert to find the best rates and order from there.“There’s also another nifty trick – a few bureaux let you order currency for collection at today’s rate and, usually for a small fee, cancel or sell it back within up to 45 days,” says Gary Caffell of MoneySavingExpert.“If the pound weakens, the rate is locked in if it improves, just cancel the order and buy at the better rate.“The only downside to buying early is the chance that the pound could strengthen before your holiday, at any time, whether that’s before or after Brexit.“So if you do choose to buy early, it’s best to close your eyes afterwards rather than let hindsight frustration ruin your holiday.“But remember, never pay a bureau and let it hold your cash for long – you’re generally not protected if it goes bust.”Prepaid cards allow you to lock in the rate of exchange now by loading the card with the foreign currency of your choice. Once abroad, you can then spend the money by withdrawing cash from an ATM or using it in the same way as a debit card.However, financial information firm Defaqto has warned that some prepaid cards have high fees or other catches, such as loading or renewal fees. It adds that many cannot be used for car hire, and customers might also have difficulties at places such as petrol stations.One straightforward way to settle any concerns of missing out on future rises is to buy half your holiday money now and half later. But whichever way you choose to buy your euros, one golden rule remains – avoid buying currency in the airport at the last minute. In December, some airport exchange bureaux were offering as little as 90 cents for every £1.For those looking to offset the problems with sterling and get some value for their break, there are ways to save, starting with where you are travelling to. Some currencies are weak against the pound, offering good value for British tourists. South Africa’s rand has been struggling lately, opening up cheaper opportunities. Bulgaria, a low-cost destination for both sun and skiing, has seen an increase of almost a third in the number of holiday bookings this year compared with 2018."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69fb7b35ac7dc30b851f479a7ef48f02d5113eb8/0_168_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8a7e460c17f040a2201b99d10a0e2233","title":"ban ki moon uk must stop investing in fossil fuels in developing countries","story":"It is time to prove it is serious about phasing out use of fossil fuels worldwideThe United Kingdom is a critically important actor in the global fight against climate change.As a permanent member of the UN security council, and a member of the G20 group of leading industrialised economies, it is well placed to further a progressive climate agenda and influence other states to fully implement commitments made under the Paris agreement.Decarbonisation is a vital part of this agenda. The UK has made important progress in this regard in April 2017, it enjoyed its first full day without any coal-fired electricity since the 1880s, which was a striking achievement for a country that had been at the vanguard of the Industrial Revolution.As the prime minister, Theresa May, said last year: “We can be proud of our success in facing up to the reality of climate change, but we are not complacent about the action needed to sustain that success in the future.”The best way for any country to avoid climate complacency is to develop robust, holistic and people-centred policies across government, so short-term trade or financial priorities do not trump the wider imperative of cutting global emissions.The UK now faces a crucial opportunity to live up to the prime minister’s words and prove it is serious about phasing out the use of fossil fuels worldwide, and not only on its own territory.The UK parliament’s environmental audit committee is currently holding an inquiry into UK Export Finance’s (UKEF) financing of fossil fuels in developing countries. This government agency provides financial support for international trade with the aim of boosting British companies’ exports.Over the longer timeframe of 2010-16, it is estimated that UKEF provided £4.8bn of support for fossil fuel projects. The UK’s total spend on its International Climate Fund for a similar period, 2011-17, was £4.9bn.These figures and policies are hard to reconcile with the UK’s commitments under the Paris agreement, its membership of the Powering Past Coal Alliance and its own pledge in 2013 to end support for public financing of new coal-fired power plants overseas.They are also at odds with the view of the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, who warned in 2014 of the stranded asset risk inherent in fossil fuel projects.The time has come for the UK to change course, in the interests of the whole world.But as the recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change set out so starkly, our target must be 1.5C if we want to avert irreparable damage to our planetary ecosystem – so even more radical action against fossil fuels is required.Meeting these challenges can only be done collectively, in a spirit of international and intergenerational solidarity under the framework of the United Nations.I was UN secretary general when the Paris agreement was signed, and the sustainable development goals agreed. I valued the UK’s contributions and commitment to both these vital multilateral achievements, and continue to believe the country can play a transformative role in shaping the global climate agenda.As deputy chair of the Elders I continue to call on G20 nations to move away from fossil fuel investment, and I believe the UK can play a leading role in this crucial move.I encourage the UK government to recalibrate its export finance policy so it is fully consistent with international climate trends and obligations.Promoting fossil fuel investments abroad locks in high-carbon infrastructure in developing countries for years to come, which is the opposite of sustainable development.There is now a growing consensus that fossil fuels should not be funded in any way by export finance organisations.The World Bank Group has already ended its finance to upstream oil and gas the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development recently ended finance to coal and the Swedish Export Credit Corporation has announced it is going fully fossil-free.UKEF and the wider UK government should use the occasion of the parliamentary inquiry to demonstrate a clear shift in policy away from fossil fuels and use its investments to support clean energy.If the UK takes these necessary steps, it can be at the forefront of the transition to a low-carbon economy. I look forward to seeing its government, industries and people rising to this challenge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/15935ea32ef788b4008707937caeb4dc8b57941d/0_5_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b3d28e163dce52cb57763b3f861d7f0","title":"okinawa referendum rejects new us military base but abe likely to press on","story":"Tokyo sees controversial plan for new base at Henoko as key to US security alliance Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has vowed to push on with the controversial relocation of a US military base in Okinawa, hours after the island’s voters overwhelmingly rejected the move in a referendum.Speaking to reporters on Monday morning, Abe acknowledged the strength of feeling among Okinawa residents but said construction work would continue.“We have been holding dialogue with people in Okinawa for a long time and intend to keep doing so to seek their understanding,” Abe said, according to Kyodo news agency.The number of “no” votes easily exceeded the threshold of more than a quarter of Okinawa’s 1.16 million eligible voters required for the island’s governor, Denny Tamaki, to “respect” the referendum’s outcome.The referendum asked voters if they opposed, supported or held neither opinion on the construction of a military base in Henoko, a fishing village on the island’s north-east coast that is home to coral reefs and one of the few remaining habitats of the dugong.The new facility is supposed to replace the marines’ Futenma airbase, located in the middle of a densely populated city. Futenma has attracted complaints about crimes committed by service personnel, noise and the threat of aircraft accidents in an area close to homes and schools.Critics say the Henoko base will destroy the area’s delicate marine ecosystem and threaten the safety of about 2,000 residents living near the site.Opposition to the US military presence on Okinawa surged after the 1995 abduction and rape and abduction of a 12-year-old girl by three US servicemen.A year later, Tokyo and Washington agreed to reduce the US military footprint on Okinawa by closing Futenma and relocating its functions to Henoko. But most Okinawans want the new base to be built elsewhere in Japan.Tamaki hailed the result as “extremely significant”, adding, “I will strongly demand that the government squarely face the resolute will of our people, review its present policy immediately and halt the construction.”He is due to visit Abe’s office and the US embassy in Tokyo to officially convey the referendum result and restart negotiations.Some Okinawa voters complained that the government in Tokyo had routinely ignored their objections to the presence of US military personnel and bases.“There are so many American troops here. Of course, ninety-nine percent of them are good people, but then there is that one percent who do bad things. It’s hard for us,” Tomomichi Shimabukuro, who runs a seaside inn, said ahead of the vote.Political and legal challenges to construction work at Henoko have frustrated US officials, who insist that marines are needed on Okinawa to respond to crises in potential flashpoints in the South and East China seas, as well as the emergence of a nuclear-armed North Korea.Abe has argued the replacement base is the only way of easing pressure on residents living near the Futenma base while maintaining Japan’s commitment to its security alliance with the US.While the “no” vote is not legally binding, the government risks accusations of dismissing local sentiment out of hand by continuing with land reclamation work in the sea off Henoko.Jun Shimabukuro, a professor at the University of the Ryukyus in Okinawa, said the referendum was an important opportunity for the island’s residents to make their voices heard. “It can be a test to gauge if democracy is working in Japan,” Shimabukuro said ahead of the vote.Col John Hutcheson, a spokesman for US Forces Japan, said the relocation plan would enable the US military to close Futenma while protecting “vital capabilities” to ensure regional security.“We are committed to maintaining good relations with local communities on Okinawa and do our best every day to balance their concerns with the necessity to maintain readiness in support of our treaty commitments,” Hutcheson said, while declining to comment directly on the referendum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87e2beb547c1f47669d68f0f97e5ef2fbdff2fc6/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=312b60f8b1eab0ce943311556b947454","title":"camorra child gangsters replace omerta with social media boasting","story":"A new generation are replacing the old mobsters in Naples and abandoning the traditional code of silenceThe first time Emanuele Sibillo was arrested he was 15: the police raided his house in the Forcella district in Naples while he was trying to get rid of two guns.Sibillo was in and out of prison throughout the following few years. Among the young inmates, he stood out for his ability to command respect and for reading books and newspapers.When he turned 18 in 2013, he prepared for the next big step: rebelling against the old Camorra clans of the Neapolitan mafia to take over the whole city.Since the early 2000s, Italian authorities have arrested hundreds of Camorra bosses and, with the old mobsters either murdered or behind bars, children and young adults such as Sibillo have begun taking their place.The phenomenon was the subject of La Paranza Dei Bambini, a 2016 novel by the Italian writer Roberto Saviano, whose bestselling non-fiction work Gomorrah, published a decade earlier, had shone a light on the Camorra and resulted in him being granted round-the-clock police protection.Paranza translates as a small fishing boat but, in Camorra lingo, it refers to a criminal group led by youngsters or small fish. Saviano refers to these children – many of whom carry 9mm revolvers by the age of 15 or 16 – as piranhas.La Paranza dei Bambini was made into a film – The Piranhas, directed by Claudio Giovannesi – which won a Silver Bear best screenplay award at this year’s Berlin film festival. The book and film chart the story of Nicola, a boy from the poor Rione Sanità district of Naples, who choses to enter the “system”, as the Camorra is known. Moreover, according to Saviano, “criminal organisations seem to be the only ones, always, to notice the existence of these children and enlist them”.In Naples, the trend is all the more alarming because the Camorra’s structure is horizontal, not hierarchical like Italy’s other main mafia outfits, the Cosa Nostra and ’Ndrangheta. The result is a neverending state of war among Camorra clans for territorial control, a war now taken over by the paranze.With generational change has come a change in style. Whereas the older mafia bosses often operated out of the limelight, observing omertà - the code of silence – today’s criminals broadcast their exploits on social media, where they pose in designer clothes, clutching €200 bottles of champagne. They wear hipster-style beards and race through the alleyways of Naples on scooters like packs of wild dogs. And they shoot.One man was shot in 2014 simply because he asked for a cigarette. An Indian man took a bullet in the chest in 2013 when two boys were “testing their gun”. One young mafia member placed under surveillance was overheard on a wiretap screaming with joy about a new gun. “I have a chrome 357 Magnum with a rubber grip, just like Al Capone’s!,” he said.Last summer, the court of appeal in Naples sentenced 42 members of two paranze from the Forcella and Decumani districts to a combined 500 years in prison.Giovannesi said: “We wanted to tell the story of these lives. Let’s not forget, these are just teenagers.” While working on the screenplay, he was influenced by great works of literature on adolescence, such as Lord of the Flies, he said. “All these books touch on the subtle contradiction between playing games and raging war.”Saviano said the the existence of the paranze was partly a product of poor social policies and the failure of state institutions including schools.Giovanni Melillo, the chief prosecutor in Naples, said the gangs were widespread in the city, where young people are recruited based on their ability for violence.In 2014, Sibillo was 18 and considered the baby godfather of the Forcella district. A year later, he was dead, the victim of an attack by members of a rival clan."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3804032.1551044277!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"met %C3%A9ireann tells staff to look on bright side of climate change","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t The Met Éireann advice suggest using metaphors such as ‘the weather on steroids’.

Photograph: Khaled ElfiqiEPABritish prime minister Theresa May has admitted she will not get a new Brexit proposal in time for MPs to hold a “meaningful vote” this week, amid warnings time is running out for an agreement before Britain leaves the European Union. Mrs May on Sunday delayed the vote until March 12th, 17 days before Britain is to leave the EU, as her ministers threatened to take control of the exit timetable. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: “For the European Union, that doesn’t change anything.” Speaking at the EU-Arab League summit in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, he added: “It doesn’t change anything from Ireland’s point of view either.”The Taoiseach is due to meet Mrs May and other EU leaders at the margins of the summit. Speaking on her way to Egypt, Mrs said she would continue the “positive talks” with the EU this week and, as a result, the vote would be delayed. “We still have it within our grasp to leave the EU with a deal on 29th March,” she said.As a way to break the impasse remains unclear, reports last night suggested support in EU circles for a long extension of the Article 50 period, possibly delaying the UK’s departure until 2021.However, senior Brussels sources dismissed these reports as inaccurate. reported this lengthy extension was favoured over a short extension to allow for plans on the future relationship to be developed and make redundant the backstop, the insurance policy to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. Mr Varadkar said the EU can offer Britain “assurances” on the Brexit withdrawal deal but will not provide something which alters its fundamental shape. The Taoiseach said any reassurances on the deal cannot “contradict the legal reality” of what has already been agreed. Mr Varadkar again ruled out a time limit or unilateral exit clause for the backstop, as has been pushed for by London. “The whole point of the backstop is to give us an assurance that we won’t see the emergence of a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, no matter what else happens as a consequence of Brexit.”‘Not up for renegotiation’When asked if an addendum to the withdrawal agreement could be drawn up to reassure the British government, the Taoiseach replied: “The withdrawal agreement, including the Irish protocol and backstop, are not up for renegotiation.“We’re happy to discuss with the United Kingdom assurances that they may need to have further confidence that the backstop, if ever applied, will not be permanent. It will only apply unless and until something supersedes it.“So we are happy to talk about mechanisms to give them that reassurance that some of them need. However, we can’t agree to something that would contradict the legal reality or the spirit behind what has already been agreed.”The deadline Mrs May has set for the meaningful vote is an attempt to circumvent MPs’ attempts to extend Brexit talks. A proposal by Labour’s Yvette Cooper, which parliament is due to debate on Wednesday, would give MPs the ability to seek an extension to the Article 50 exit process if no deal has been approved by parliament by March 13th. Responding to the vote delay, Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mrs May was “putting the country at risk by recklessly running down the clock to force MPs to choose between her bad deal and a disastrous no deal”. The European Parliament’s Brexit chief, Guy Verhofstadt, tweeted: “I have seen many surprising decisions in a lifetime in politics. But this is close to being one of the most reckless.” Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz told reporters at the summit: “If by the beginning of March there’s no support for the deal then I think it would be good to postpone Brexit because a no-deal scenario is bad for the EU but extremely bad for the UK.” – Additional reporting Financial Times Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Video: Fianna Fáil\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t‘We have to accept the harsh reality of this very moment,’ Micheál Martin told delegates at the Fianna Fáil ardfheis. Photograph: Stephen CollinsCollinsBut enough of the past.Stuffed on a massive feed of Seán Lemass, Éamon de Valera and the founding fathers of Fianna Fáil, the contented delegates sat back in their seats, popped a waistband button and prepared for galloping indigestion to return.The present day, not so palatable.Oh, but they could have feasted for ever on the songs and stories of the good old days (is there anything to be said for another quivery clip from Dev?) and never stopped swapping yarns of more recent nights when it felt like they owned the entire world and not just every sweaty inch of public space in the sprawling Citywest complex.Born to it, they reminded themselves on Saturday night with loads of stirring, comforting newsreel incontrovertibly placing their party – not those showy late arrivals from Sinn Féin – at the scene of the birth of the nation.“Fianna Fáil – The Republican Party.” That time-honoured slogan, with its well worn “An Ireland for All” tag line, was writ large on the platform when the current leader came to administer a dose of political reality after the nostalgic wallow.“Fianna Fáil – The Responsible Party. Tolerating Fine Gael in the National Interest” is what it should have read.This was the thrust of Micheál Martin’s message and also the main reason why his troops, despite all those soothing shots of history, were feeling somewhat dyspeptic at their 79th ardfheis.Keeping a Fine Gael government in power through a confidence-and-supply agreement is proving increasingly hard for them to stomach. They’ve tolerated two years of it now, and the thought of enabling a cast of cocky Blueshirt pups to run their country for much longer has them all feeling distinctly queasy.So in what amounted to a “bear with me” speech, Micheál had to persuade them to persevere, no matter how much it might stick in the craw. He told them he feels their pain and, if it’s any consolation, he would love to give Fine Gael the order of the boot. It’s in his power to pull the plug, but he can’t. The “massive risk” involved in triggering a general election while Brexit still remains such a threat to Ireland is too big a price to pay.“In normal times, there would be no question about what should happen to this government, but we have to accept the harsh reality of this very moment,” he told delegates, aware of the other harsh reality that if he doesn’t convince them to back his agreement with Fine Gael, they may pull the plug on him.National interestHaving spent the evening enjoying a “special 1919 commemoration”, Micheál plunged his audience straight back into history, invoking the names of the Fianna Fáil greats, from “the first chairperson, Constance Markiewicz”, to bolster his argument that they must do the right thing. “It’s a difficult decision for us, but it’s the right decision and it reinforces the fact that Fianna Fáil is putting the national interest first.”There was loud and virtuous applause from the faithful, who were really clapping themselves, their selflessness and commitment to country. Given their visceral hatred of all things Fine Gael, endorsing Micheál’s confidence-and-supply arrangement a little while longer was the most heroic thing these dyed-in-the wool Fianna Fáilers could do apart from dying for Ireland.This was only a one-day ardfheis, but one day is enough for anyone. It began with Cork TD Billy Kelleher plastering the long, private approach road to the hotel with election posters urging party members in Ireland South to vote for him in the forthcoming European election selection convention. He had more posters inside the building – full length and in your face.Micheál Martin said last week that he would prefer if Kelleher ran again for the Dáil instead of looking for a seat in Europe. He laughed off suggestions that his TD for Cork North Central had given a resounding two fingers to that suggestion.As for Billy, he acted the wide-eye innocent all day as smiling delegates sidled over to tell him he was an awful man altogether for putting it up to Micheál like that.An elderly man cornered him outside the session on affordable housing, grabbing his hand. “Jaysus, you’re a terrible hoor! Fair fucks to ya!” Billy looked at him. “Wha’? I thought everyone was putting up posters, like.”Old and youngThe 1919 commemoration was hosted by Éamon Ó Cuív, grandson of Éamon de Valera. Not that he makes a big thing about it or anything. Ronan McGreevy of The  spoke at length about the Seán Lemass tapes. St James’s Brass and Reed Band from Dublin and the Bishopstown sign-language choir from Cork performed the national anthem to mark its 110th anniversary.The hall was like a sauna, full to capacity, with disappointed delegates left outside. The audience profile was on the elderly male side of mature, although there was also a large contingent from Ógra Fianna Fáil, all dressed to the nines. There seemed an unusually high turnout of teenage girls wearing glittery mini-dresses, but they wandered by mistake into the aftermath of the leader’s speech while trying to find where Romanian crooner Ovidiu Rusu, was performing. (Upstairs. Sold out.)From our vantage high up in the back, the amount of bald heads and grey hair was striking. Younger colleagues were highly amused by the number of old flip-phones and Nokia phones in use in our vicinity.Sea of blueThe much sought after warm-up speech slot went to rising star Lisa Chambers, who is the party’s Brexit spokesperson. The Nokia contingent were mightily impressed, even though Lisa is from Mayo and they had taken to quietly exclaiming “Up the Rebels” every so often. She appeared on stage in a striking white dress (perhaps in tribute to the nurses). “That’s the Chambers one,” said one of the Nokia lads. “Oh, that’s right” said flip-phone. “A lovely-looking girl. I think she’s very good.”To underline the gravity of the message, Micheál Martin burst into the hall without the usual loud blast of young people’s music. But everyone cheered anyway when he raced on to the stage. He was alone. Alone in a sea of blue, which may have been a metaphor.As he neared the end, perspiring from the heat, we scanned the front rows for likely platform athletes.

Photograph: Stefan RousseauPA WireBritish prime minister Theresa May is holding meetings with European leaders at a summit in Egypt as attempts to resolve the Brexit impasse continue.Mrs May has admitted she will not get a new Brexit proposal in time for MPs to hold a “meaningful vote” this week, amid warnings time is running out for an agreement before Britain leaves the European Union. On Sunday she delayed the vote until March 12th, 17 days before Britain is to leave the EU, as her ministers threatened to take control of the exit timetable.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said: “For the European Union, that doesn’t change anything.” Speaking at the EU-Arab League summit in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, he added: “It doesn’t change anything from Ireland’s point of view either.”Mrs May held talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the two leaders attended the summit in Egypt.Mrs May and her German counterpart met over breakfast on the fringes of the gathering at Sharm el Sheikh on Monday.TalksMrs May also met Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte for Brexit-related talks on the fringes of the EU-Arab League summit. Mrs May is holding meetings with a number of EU leaders, including Mr Varadkar, on the final day of the summit.Former Irish ambassador to the UK, Italy and the EU Bobby McDonagh said Mrs May is going to “run down the clock” in terms of the UK’s departure from the EU.He told Newstalk Breakfast that “the ball is very much in the British court at this stage. I think her game plan is very clear.”Brexit-backing Conservative MP Owen Paterson said there would be “very wide support in parliament” for a Brexit agreement providing legally-binding assurances that the UK and EU will work together following March 29 to find technological arrangements to keep the Irish border open.“There is real progress going on behind the scenes,” Mr Paterson told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “We have come up with proposals for the Irish border which Steve Barclay has put to the commission and he is going to set up a taskforce of EU officials and UK officials.Labour MP Yvette Cooper said the Brexit amendment she hopes to secure on Wednesday would allow parliament to tell the prime minister to seek an extension to the negotiation process but leave it in the Government’s hands to decide how long it should be.ResponsibleShe told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The Government doesn’t feel to me to be behaving like a responsible government at all at the moment. The idea that we could be only a few weeks from Brexit and we still don’t know what kind of Brexit we are going to have and we’re not even going to have a vote on it until two weeks before that final deadline.British defence minister Tobias Ellwood suggested there was a possibility of Theresa May herself announcing an extension of the two-year Article 50 negotiation process beyond March 29th.Mr Ellwood told Today: “The prime minister is listening and is recognising the fact that we have tried very, very hard in order to secure a deal.”Asked if she could announce an Article 50 extension after her return from talks with other EU leaders in Egypt, he said: “You need to wait and hear what she has to say when she gets back.British education secretary Damian Hinds told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the withdrawal agreement was a “good deal”, but it was necessary to deal with “legitimate concerns” about the backstop proposals before bringing it back to parliament. – PADeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

They will fight on,” she said. “The Islamic State remains. We are weak now but we will come back again.”The 21-year-old was one of hundreds of bedraggled women who emerged from Baghuz in recent days. They waited in a huddled mass in a clearing to surrender to the Kurdish fighters of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).Mothers clutched dirty blankets and tugged suitcases through the mud while trying not to lose track of their exhausted children. A woman lifted her black abaya to defecate in a field. There was shouting as families shoved past each other to get to the trucks that would take them north to the refugee camps.These are among the final citizens of the Islamic State, the last people to have lived in the jihadists’ failed experiment in empire. The SDF now estimates that around 5,000 civilians and 1,500 fighters remain in Baghuz, more than originally thought but still a fraction of the 8 million people who once lived under the jihadists\u0027 black banner.The SDF have been shocked at the numbers of civilians coming out of the village of BaghuzEven in their hour of humiliation and defeat, many of the women still burned with the fanaticism that powered the Islamic State for the last five years. They offered no remorse for the caliphate’s crimes and vowed that it would it one day return.That was the promise of Umm Mohammed, a 37-year-old from the nearby town of al-Bukamal. Like most Isil women she identified herself by her Arabic nickname, meaning Mother of Mohammed.Whatever her oldest son’s real name was, he is dead now. He was killed defending al-Bukamal, she said, while a second son was cut down in the town of Sousa. Her five remaining children were huddled around her feet, their eyes wide with fear and faces caked with dirt.Was it worth losing two sons in battle and subjecting her other children to horrors of war?“We stayed in the Islamic State because we want heaven. And we buy heaven with our souls and our children’s souls,” she said. “God didn’t create us for this life, he created us for the next life.”In between dense paragraphs of religious dogma and venomous condemnations of Shia Muslims, Umm Mohammed offered glimpses of the situation inside Baghuz.She and her family had been living in a tent made of rags for two weeks. “Our tents were like palaces because they were in the Islamic State,” she said.Islamic State losing its grip on SyriaShe said there were shortages of food but also that poorer families were unable to pay the high prices that come with a siege economy. Isil fighters had distributed some food but it was not enough. Without phones or internet access, they had little sense of the scale of Isil’s collapse. They knew only that Western warplanes were overhead all night and all day.As she spoke, a female Kurdish fighter searched through the folds of an Isil woman’s abaya. The jihadist’s wife stood patiently as the young woman in the colourful scarf checked her.As far as the Kurds knew, any one of these women could be a suicide bomber. Isil has no qualms about using women or children in attacks and none of these people had been searched for explosive vests before they reached the SDF’s lines.The frantic hours it took to load the Isil families on to the trucks passed without incident under the watchful eye of Kurdish fighters. A column of American special forces drove past and bearded commandos peered through the windows at people from Baghuz.There were moments when the women’s certainty seemed to crack. One mother said that the Isil fighters had promised them that the UN would be waiting to receive them once they came out of Baghuz. Instead they found only their Kurdish conquerors and waiting journalists.But she insisted that Isil had not misled her. “There is no betrayal in the Islamic State.”The large numbers of civilians in the remaining Isil pocket have complicated the SDF offensiveThe woman said that Isil had ordered them to go as part of a deal struck between the jihadists and the SDF. Their understanding of the terms were murky but some suggested that the SDF agreed to let them out in return for Isil releasing Kurdish prisoners.The SDF strongly denied that there was a deal but said that they welcomed civilians coming out of Baghuz. “We are fighting a terror group. Either they surrender or they have to fight and die,” said Adnan Afrin, an SDF commander.The women said that was exactly the intention of the remaining Isil fighters, who were heavily armed and prepared to launch suicide bombers to defend Baghuz. “The brothers have everything and they are ready always. Even the women are carrying guns and are ready to be suicide bombers,” said one.SDF commanders have been shocked at how many women and children have emerged from the tiny pocket of Isil-territory. They had originally expected there were only around 1,500 civilians inside but so far more than 5,000 have come out.The large numbers of civilians have made it difficult for the SDF to call in airstrikes and will likely confound the predictions of a quick victory made by Donald Trump and others. Cmdr Afrin said it was impossible to predict how much long the operation would take.While most of the women continued to proclaim their loyalty to Isil, a few began a familiar routine of claiming that they had nothing to do with the jihadists.Umm Mohammed had some advice about women who said that. “Everyone here is from the Islamic State. Every one of us,” she said. “Anyone who says they are not is a liar.”  Why Tormund, a Game of Thrones fan favourite, might have survived The Wall after allBrexit latest news: Theresa May discusses delaying Brexit with Angela Merkel over breakfast in the desert  Labour has a \u0026#39widespread problem\u0026#39 with anti-Semitism, Momentum chief saysComment: The Brexit Ghostbusters are at work.

But how much might shoppers be affected by increased tariffs, border checks and a weaker currency?Business groups have issued a series of dire warnings in recent days over how much more expensive food shopping will become after Brexit.The impact will vary across different ranges of products and depends on a number of factors such as how dependent the UK is on imports rather than domestic supply and the import taxes that will be applied by the UK government.Producers are likely to pass on additional tariffs to retailers and ultimately to customers but these vary considerably. Birds Eye’s UK and Ireland boss Wayne Hudson said that for his business, additional tariffs will range from 2 to 20 per cent, which he said will almost immediately be passed on to customers.Delays at at the Channel ports are also set to add to costs because of mandatory EU checks\u0026nbspon people and goods entering the EU from the UK. This will affect both imports and exports at Dover and Folkestone because of the frequent and closed loop nature of the crossings, the Cabinet Office has said.Half of the UK’s food arrives through Dover and Folkestone, and during spring Britain is particularly dependent on imports of fresh fruit and vegetables because many are out of season in this country and must be imported from warmer climes.\u0026nbspAt this time of the year, around 90 per cent of lettuces, 80 per cent of tomatoes and 70 per cent of soft fruit is sourced from, or delivered via, the EU.World\u0027s food supply \u0027under threat\u0027 from loss of bioersityDespite Transport Secretary Chris Grayling\u0027s assurances that ports are ready for disruption, plans for additional ferry routes to ease congestion have not been successful, with only a fraction of the hoped-for capacity secured.\u0026nbspExchange rates are also likely to add to food costs if no withdrawal agreement is ratified. Economists forecast that the pound will fall sharply in the event of a no deal meaning less purchasing power, making imports more expensive. Much of this will filter through to higher prices on the shelves.It is not yet possible to quantify the exact effects of additional tariffs. We will know more\u0026nbspafter the Department for International Trade publishes a list of new import taxes that will apply to more than 5,200 products, including food.The EU imposes relatively high tariffs on some food products in order to protect European farming and food supplies. For dairy, the average tariff is more than 35 per cent while for some meat products, such as lamb, it is more than 40 per cent.A number of hard-line Brexiteers have advocated unilaterally slashing UK import duties to zero in order to reduce prices for shoppers. Such an approach could mean lower prices for some products.But the zero-tariff approach has been ruled out by environment secretary Michael Gove because it is likely to have a disastrous impact on UK farmers. They have developed their businesses in the context of the EU’s customs union but would suddenly have to compete with cheap imports from around the world, including from countries which apply lower food standards that the UK.\u0026nbsp“One thing I can reassure you it will not be the case that we will have zero-rate tariffs on products, there will be protections for sensitive sections of agriculture and food production,” Mr Gove told the National Farmers’ Union conference last week.Zero tariffs would not only hurt the UK food industry. Ceramic producers have warned that 22,000 jobs could be at risk from inexpensive imports, particularly from China.\u0026nbspIf the UK leaves the EU without a deal trade would fall back on World Trade Organization rules.This could mean for example, a 46 per cent tariff on mozzarella, 40 per cent on beef, 21 per cent on tomatoes and 15.5 per cent on apples, the British Retail Consortium has said.Every WTO member has a list of tariffs and quotas that they apply to other countries. While the average EU tariff is quite low, for food it is often relatively high.While the UK can lower its tariffs, under the WTO\u0027s “most favoured nation” rules, it has to offer the same raxes\u0026nbspto every member around the world unless it has agreed a trade deal with them.So far, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox has only been able to secure deals with a small fraction of the UK’s trading partners.Analysts at Retails Economics predict that the cost of staples like beef and tomatoes could soar, with an extra £9bn\u0026nbspadded to the overall cost of food for UK consumers.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The vast majority of MOO’s sales are in the huge North American market, now accounting for 75 per cent of their revenues.In addition to its well known cards, the company’s range also includes hard- and softcover notebooks and business cardholders, among other things. Its London headquarters have recently moved from a warehouse in Shoreditch to a 35,000 square foot space down the road in Farringdon, which comes complete with an ice-cream machine, pool tables and a “library” – a giant bookcase, where MOO employees can bring in books to place on shelves.Created with Sketch.Hot desks: The coolest office spaces in the world Show all 5Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.So it might be hard to imagine the first iteration of the business was a bit of a flop, with the company nearly dying in late 2005.What changed? A little creativity and a lot of persistence.Born and raised in north London, Moross, now 40, describes his younger self as more creative than studious.“It wasn’t like I wanted to be a policeman or a firefighter. I didn’t have a clear sense of what I wanted to do,” he tells\u0026nbspThe Independent.“Retrospectively, it’s interesting that no one ever talks about becoming an entrepreneur at school. I remember doing career coaching and going to job fairs, and entrepreneurship was very underrepresented as an option,” he adds.Moross attended Sussex University to study philosophy and politics – a course he enjoyed, although he wasn’t inclined to make a career out of it. “I wasn’t interested in becoming a politician, and professional philosopher isn’t that much of a job,” he says.After a brief spell at the BBC he joined a startup called Sorted, a tool that told users about the hidden places – from coffee houses to bookstores – in their neighbourhood.The business eventually ran out of money and closed in 2001, prompting Moross to get involved with Imagination, a design agency.“What I loved at Imagination was working on big brands with smart people. But what I was missing in that role was being able to design products and make products better and more exciting. I didn’t want to do the campaign around the car, I wanted to make it.” he says.All of MOO’s products are sold via its websiteIt was 2004 when, during a sleepless night, Moross first had the idea to launch a startup selling paper cards. His first enterprise – the rather ambiguously named Pleasure Cards.“MOO was once Pleasure Cards. A great idea with a horrible name\u0026nbspthat didn’t work for all sorts of good reasons,” he admits.“The idea was to create a business card for your social life – to give out at a party, say, instead of in a business meeting.”Set up with £100,000 of seed finance from angel investor Robin Klein (who is still on the board of MOO today), the idea never took off.“By the end of the first year of business we were quickly running out of cash and people didn’t understand the concept. “I thought that instead of making these social cards, we should start printing for social networks, help people put their photographs on paper, give them access to design tools in order to make their brands look good.”The company was saved by a lucrative tie-up with photo-sharing website Flickr, which allowed users to print their pictures onto the business cards – sparking a lot of interest from investors.The promise of real revenue was enough to secure another £5m in investment and that was when MOO as we know it today was born.In the age of smartphones, the process of handing out a physical card with your information on it can seem remarkably outdated. But\u0026nbspthe digital revolution actually gave new life to one of the world’s oldest industries.Moross says: “Business cards might be 300 years old but without digital technology our business wouldn’t exist. We sell 100 per cent of our products through the website.”“MOO cards can also carry a different image on every single card, thanks to the digital printing press.“It show that, in a digital world, good quality physical objects still matter. Meeting someone is a much more special experience than receiving an email. When you meet in person, you want to be remembered and our hope is that our card helps you make that connection.”That is not to say that MOO has not made a few digital updates since its launch. In 2015, the firm released a new range of cards embedded with near-field communication technology that connects it directly to a web page or social media network when tapped with a smartphone.To fight off competition you need to understand the landscape, what your customers want and what they value. We’re constantly looking ahead and thinking of how we can make our products better.MOO is also continuously trying to improve its green credentials and sticking its nose into the world of eco-friendly papers.In 2017, the company collaborated with Mohawk Fine Papers to take discarded cotton T-shirt scraps and give them new life as premium business cards.Usually, the scraps left behind from a T-shirt go to waste. But MOO takes these bits of fabric and uses a traditional printing technique to turn it into a high-quality paper.“To fight off competition you need to understand the landscape, what your customers want and what they value,” Moross says.“We’re constantly looking ahead and thinking of how we can make our products better.“In the case of cards made out of cotton, many of our competitors already have eco paper – but we took one step further to create a new type of better quality green paper.”At about £14 for a pack of 50 original cards and £25 for a pack of luxe cards (printed on extra-thick luxury paper), MOO cards are a premium product. But they remain a cheaper option for those looking for customised business cards without the need to enlist a designer.“To some extent, if all you need is very cheap business card, you can just write an email to that person with your signature or write your number on a piece of paper.“But professional design is expensive and hard to access. So we talk about great design for everyone and we think about how to use technology to make the design cheaper and the software accessible or how we can help professional designers make their brand stand out.”A View from the Top: Jonathan Sattin, founder of Triyoga A View from the Top with insurance boss Amanda BlancA View From The Top: Kaidi Ruusalepp, founder of FunderbeamA View from the Top with Herschel Mayers, CEO of VitalityWhen MOO was first founded, the team, which then consisted of just eight people, decided they would gather for a staff lunch on a weekly basis.Fifteen years later, the tradition endures, with employees being treated to free lunch every Friday.Moross, a keen photographer who has visited more than 60 countries, wants employees to have a life outside their jobs, believing this only increases productivity and creativity.“I tend not to work on weekends and I switch off very easily. You’re failing at your job if you’re 15 years in and you’re still working every hour of the day. You’re either failing at your job or you’re failing at your life and probably robbing your team of the things they could be doing.“I want people to come to work and be themselves. No one has to wear a suit and tie unless they want to, they can wear what they would at home – providing they wear clothes, of course.”Refreshingly, for a tech veteran who has little to prove to anyone, Moross can’t seem to rest on his laurels and is already looking to the next steps. “It’s always about pushing the business further. “This year, we’ll be expanding our product range and building much more for professional designers. But at the end of the day, it all comes down to building a good, strong, sustainable business.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

But scientists didn\u0027t know that they themselves were still wrapped in the edges of the\u0026nbspgeocorona.The extra source of hydrogen laying far out from Earth is not enough to allow space exploration, or to support any kind of human life. Down here, it would be referred to as a vacuum.But fortunately those particles do not pose any threat for anyone interacting with them, such as future space travellers that hope to journey to orbit around the Moon.“There is also ultraviolet radiation associated to the geocorona, as the hydrogen atoms scatter sunlight in all directions, but the impact on astronauts in lunar orbit would be negligible compared to the main source of radiation -- the Sun,” says Jean-Loup Bertaux, co-author and former principal investigator of SWAN, the instrument that made the founding.But it could get in the way of future observations around the Moon, the researchers caution.“Space telescopes observing the sky in ultraviolet wavelengths to study the chemical composition of stars and galaxies would need to take this into account,” adds Jean-Loup.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This amounts to around 100,000 students, if the results were reflected across the UK. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbspAnd the poll, of more than 1,600 students, reveals that nearly half\u0026nbspof those who have accrued debt have in excess of £1,000 and one in five owe more than £5,000.Created with Sketch.Student news in pictures Show all 34Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.South Korean policemen detain student protestors during a protest against South Korean President Park Geun-Hye outside the National Assembly in Seoul, South Korea.Filipino demonstrators face off with anti-riot police during a protest near the US Embassy in Manila, PhilippineHundreds of protesters including Indigenous People, students and militant groups marched towards the US Embassy to protest against the presence of US military troops and condemning the violent dispersal which left at least forty people hurt including twenty police officers and three people who were run over by a police vanA federal judge in Mexico has ordered that a once-fugitive police chief be held on charges of kidnapping in the disappearance of 43 studentsA man holds up a photograph of a missing student with a caption reading \u0027We are missing 43,\u0027 during a meeting marking the 25-month anniversary of the disappearances of 43 students in the southern state of Guerrero, in Mexico City.

And gambling has become more accessible to young people amid the rise in technology, the NUS says.Institutions must do more to raise awareness of the dangers of unsafe gambling and to signpost to other support that is available, the NUS and Gambling Commission have warned.Jason Heffron, a student at the University of Birmingham, used to turn to gambling when money was tight. He said: “At vulnerable times I’d often end up losing money that I couldn’t afford to lose.”In his second year, the student lost £500 over a few weeks and he struggled to pay the rent when he found himself £1,000 into his overdraft. He gave up gambling not long after the incident.He said: “When you are at university, when you are a bit more vulnerable to the benefits financially, you chase that high. You are only living off a few hundred pounds for a few months.“A rise in living cost is definitely a problem. Rent prices are crazy for most major cities now. Most student loans don’t cover rent so you need financial support before you even think about living.”Ban scratchcards for under 18s, minister saysThe government needs to overhaul the funding system for higher education and provide more student support to students so they are less vulnerable to gambling, the NUS says.Eva Crossan Jory, NUS vice president for welfare, told The Independent: “Students have said the only way that they can pay rent is to gamble. That is really worrying.“I think anecdotally more students are relying on gambling as a means of finance rather than just doing it for fun. I think previously people were not doing it as much as a means of survival.”She added: “It is so easy nowadays to gamble on your phone and not even realise that you may have a serious addiction. It doesn’t always seem like real money when it is all online.”Speaking ahead of the government’s review of post-18 education and funding, Ms Crossan Jory said: “There needs to be a renewed focus on the reasons why some students feel it’s necessary to supplement their income through gambling – which not only land\u0026nbspstudents in even greater debt, but also can lead to feelings of guilt, stress and depression.”Gambling firms to stop advertising during live sporting eventsOnline casinos hit with millions in fines amid regulator clampdownMore than 50,000 under-17s have gambling problems, report revealsHelen Rhodes, programme director of the Gambling Commission, which helped the NUS to develop the survey, said: “These results add extra emphasis that there is a significant risk for young adults and for students that needs to be addressed, and we welcome the part the NUS is playing to do so.”John de Pury, assistant director of policy at Universities UK (UUK), said: “Universities are focused on student welfare to support wellbeing and learning. This includes efforts to educate students on risky behaviours and to mitigate the impact of such behaviours on their university experience. \u0026nbsp“Online gambling is an issue that applies more widely than to simply the student population.

As a new breed of smartphones, Huawei Mate X combines 5G, foldable screen, AI and an all-new mode of interfacing to provide consumers with an unprecedented user experience.The Huawei Mate X will be the first key for consumers to open the door to 5G smart living.The company confirmed the new device would cost 2,299 Euro - higher than Samsung\u0027s Galaxy Fold, which has been given a price tag of 1,980 dollars.The Chinese firm\u0027s presence in the 5G infrastructure market remains a geopolitical talking point, with the United States warning European countries it may find it difficult to work with anyone who choose to use Huawei products in their networks, after raising security concerns over the Chinese company.But Huawei appears to be ignoring these on-going issues as it continues to expand its phone business.Now the second largest smartphone maker in the world, it is also due to unveil a new range of flagship devices in Paris next month.In terms of its foldable device, The Mate X will also come with fingerprint sensor built into its power button as well as featuring a camera system engineered with German camera firm Leica.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Notice anything about that sentence?\u0026nbspOr what about this, a brilliant snapshot of the works of TS\u0026nbspEliot by WH\u0026nbspAuden: “T\u0026nbspEliot, top bard, notes putrid tang emanating, is sad. I’d assign it a name: gnat dirt upset on drab pot toilet.”As per the previous, it’s a palindrome, one of those weird and wonderful linguistic constructs that reads exactly the same backwards as forwards. There’s a letter in the dead centre (“I”), like a fulcrum, on which everything else hinges. The great French virtuoso Georges Perec (his parents were Polish), came up with one in French (“Le grand palindrome”) over 10 pages long. Eccentric, certainly, possibly mad. But what if all human history is like this, and with every step forwards we are just as certainly going backwards? Welcome to paleo world.Perhaps the best recent example of palindromic history is the fall of the Berlin Wall – after which all those bricks were neatly recycled to build other walls, and people are still calling a halt to government with a view to building another one, bigger and better than the last. Even though it’s going to be hard to beat the Great Wall of China. Or even, in its more modest way, Hadrian’s Wall, all designed to keep the barbarians at bay. Which is ironic, because we are the barbarians, gorillas who can hold a pen or a phone. The more sophisticated, the more primal. The more advanced, the more primitive. Behold, homo americanus, a species newly depicted in anthropologist\u0026nbspEmmanuel Todd’s vast and mind-expanding Lineages of Modernity: A History of Humanity from the Stone Age to Homo Americanus, which posits that “It is the very primitiveness of America that has made it successful.”I was reminded, reading a recent biography of the French anthropologist\u0026nbspClaude Levi-Strauss, how beautifully humbling anthropology can be, rather like looking out on the Milky Way on a cold, clear night. You think you’re you. But in reality you’re not. You’re just part of a massive system of interlocking parts, stretching across time and space. The very idea of the self is a product of society, designed to keep everyone going about their business. But it’s a delusion that works, as Todd brilliantly argues. It’s one of the great paradoxes of human evolution: the more we convince ourselves we are autonomous iniduals, possessed of free will and integrity, the more we are exemplifying an ancient zeitgeist.Created with Sketch.The fall of the Berlin Wall – in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast German border guards stand on a section of the Berlin wall in front of the Brandenburg gate on November 11, 1989 210 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onCars line up at the Pomezy border station, on November 5, 1989 as East German refugees cross the border to West Germany310 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast German refugees penned behind barriers outside the West German embassy wait for the buses to take them to the railway station to leave Prague on 4th October 1989 410 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onThousands of young East Berliners gather at the Berlin Wall, near the Brandenburg Gate on November 11, 1989 510 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast Berliners climb onto the Berlin Wall to celebrate the effective end of the city\u0027s partition, 31st December 1989610 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onA replica of a watchtower of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) on display in the Potsdamer Platz Arkaden shopping mall in Berlin where an exhibition titled 25 Years of the Fall of the Berlin Wall has been staged710 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onBerliners from East and West celebrate at the Brandenburg Gate in December 1989810 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast German drivers queue at the Schirnding border crossing  into Czecho-slovakia five days before the fall of the Berlin910 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onThe Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, watched by his wife Raisa, right, kisses his East German  counterpart Erich Honecker in East Berlin in October 19891010 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onPolice from both sides stand idly by as the Berlin Wall is breached for the first time between East and West, at the Sandkrug Bridge crossing-point on Invaliden Strasse, in November 1989110 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast German border guards stand on a section of the Berlin wall in front of the Brandenburg gate on November 11, 1989 210 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onCars line up at the Pomezy border station, on November 5, 1989 as East German refugees cross the border to West Germany310 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast German refugees penned behind barriers outside the West German embassy wait for the buses to take them to the railway station to leave Prague on 4th October 1989 410 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onThousands of young East Berliners gather at the Berlin Wall, near the Brandenburg Gate on November 11, 1989 510 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast Berliners climb onto the Berlin Wall to celebrate the effective end of the city\u0027s partition, 31st December 1989610 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onA replica of a watchtower of the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) on display in the Potsdamer Platz Arkaden shopping mall in Berlin where an exhibition titled 25 Years of the Fall of the Berlin Wall has been staged710 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onBerliners from East and West celebrate at the Brandenburg Gate in December 1989810 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onEast German drivers queue at the Schirnding border crossing  into Czecho-slovakia five days before the fall of the Berlin910 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onThe Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, watched by his wife Raisa, right, kisses his East German  counterpart Erich Honecker in East Berlin in October 19891010 The fall of the Berlin Wall – 25 years onPolice from both sides stand idly by as the Berlin Wall is breached for the first time between East and West, at the Sandkrug Bridge crossing-point on Invaliden Strasse, in November 1989If you’re starting to feel just a little bit weary of economics, then join the club. It’s one of the oddities of capitalism that, just as in Marxism, everything has to be seen in terms of economics or freakonomics. As the Bill Clinton campaign had it, it’s the economy, stupid! But what if, fundamentally and looking at it from an anthropological perspective, it’s nothing to do with the economy after all, stupid? Economics is only concerned with the conscious, even possibly rational part of human behaviour. But there is a collective unconscious too\u0026nbspthat we generally forget about, or would like to forget about: notably the family, or (to speak like an anthropologist) kinship relations.The present no longer exists: How our brains aren\u0027t past NeanderthalEveryone has one. To begin with, anyhow. Even if, as in the case of orphans, it may not last very long. But everybody gets orphaned\u0026nbspin the end. You lose your parents. Or maybe your parents kick you out. Or your parents split up. Maybe you lose touch with your siblings (if you ever had any in the first place). Maybe it’s Cain and Abel. Maybe your father takes you up a mountain to sacrifice you to Yahweh (thus Abraham and Isaac).I’m trying to remember if my parents ever actually said to me, “You’re on your own, now, sonny Jim,” or words to that effect, but it was definitely implied. I was confronted with the anguish of liberty early on. “You want to be a vegetarian? OK, let me see, I think we have some soya here somewhere.” Or “So you’re an atheist now. Interesting!” Or “That’s fine, you don’t have to be a solicitor.” And, “She seems nice.”Inidualism is entirely the product of the collective. The idea that there is ‘no such thing as society’ could not even begin to exist without the solid foundation of a highly organised society right behind itThe nuclear family, in other words, is about as close to anything-goes anarchy as it is possible to imagine within a rule-bound, semi-protective environment (“Remember to look before you cross the street”). It’s why we hate anyone to be “controlling”. The typical western-style family is, in essence, centrifugal, designed to shove you out into the world, producing adventurers and explorers and entrepreneurs and philosophers, prodding and probing and shaping reality. Rugged, dynamic, creative inidualists, with women given (in the best case) equivalent status to men. Rather like the early nomads that spread out to populate the earth, rather successfully, pausing only to exterminate Neanderthals along the way.Inidualism is entirely the product of the collective. The very idea that there is “no such thing as society” could not even begin to exist without the solid foundation of a highly organised society right behind it. And this sense of being doomed to wander lonely as a cloud is nothing new. It is – as Rousseau would say – “the state of nature”, our primal condition. Technological modernity coincides with our archaic origins. We are still savages, operating very much along the lines of hunter-gatherers, Bushmen of the Manhattan savanna, equipped with socks and shoes and a Twitter account. All the trappings of so-called civilisation are paper-thin. Strip away Sainsbury’s and Waitrose, and we would soon be picking up rocks and making spears and looking for a woolly mammoth to take down.The Flintstones never really went away. Which is why we now have paleo politics (what Todd calls “primordial democracy”) in the shape of Trump and Brexit. Or, as the existentialists put it so neatly, hell is other people. Some degree of xenophobia or plain old misanthropy is built into inidualism. Paranoia is a by-product of liberty. You’re on your own now, like the three pigs, but you have to beware of the big bad wolf. So build those walls strong and high.William Golding’s classic Lord of the Flies tells the tale of a bunch of polite British schoolboys who, left to their own devices on an island, are soon killing and slaughtering and worshipping idols. But it’s not fiction. I know a guy, Sam Fussell, who dropped out of Christ Church Oxford, where he was studying English poetry, got into bodybuilding, and eventually went primitive in the wilds of Montana where he shoots wolves and bears – sometimes with a bow and arrow. And the odd thing is, I really like this guy. He is my avatar. He taught me to shoot and has promised to save a bullet just for me for when the going gets too tough. Fussell is the closest real-life counterpart, in my experience, to the fictional figure of Jack Reacher, the XXL vigilante hero of Lee Child’s novels. They are both variations on homo americanus. Which is probably our biggest export to date, an exemplary product of the Anglosphere, and legitimate successor to 200,000-year old homo sapiens. Together with the second amendment of the American Constitution and regular urban massacres.But as T\u0026nbspEliot, top bard, pointed out, humankind cannot bear very much reality. We get protective, especially where our young ones are concerned. And this is where a different kind of family set-up stems from. Emmanuel Todd, who is a demographer as well as anthropologist, hit me with an amazing statistic. In Iraq, 35 per cent\u0026nbspof married couples are first-cousins (he reckons that this figure can rise to 50 per cent\u0026nbspin Pakistan). He finds that across vast areas of Eurasia, a different kind of kinship system has developed which is patrilineal and communitarian, with fathers transmitting power and property to sons and keen to see close relatives marrying. This leads not just to women being disenfranchised and segregated, but to the subordination of the inidual, social stasis and clan wars.of married couples in Iraq are first-cousinsThe powerful point that he makes, contrary to conventional wisdom, is that the more repressive, controlling, non-nuclear, more centripetal and inward-looking (or “endogamous”) family is not “primitive”, although it may well be medieval. It is the nuclear (and “exogamous”) family that is more primitive, more caveman, more nomad. The cosy-cousins family is a much more recent invention and should, to his way of thinking be deconstructed. We need to go more primitive, not less.If we consider, for a moment, the current political landscape in the UK, you would have to describe it as increasingly exogamous. Nuclear in the best sense. There seems no compelling reason why, like all good families, parties should not split apart. Schisms are probably a good thing. Better to be disunited if you’re only going to unite around something utterly dumb and dismal.If economics is conscious behaviour, and education and religion are our subconscious, then it is still family relationships that form the deepest level of our unconscious life. Hence it is around inidualism that the clash (or at least ergence) of civilisations will occur. Todd sets out a table in which different societies are compared in terms of their core values under various headings to do with attitudes towards equality, feminism, endogamy and\u0026nbspauthority. The “anthropological distance” between the Anglosphere and Denmark (hello, Danes!) is zero. At the opposite end of the spectrum, the combined distance from Saudi Arabia is 7.5. I think we can assume, in the aftermath of Khashoggi, that the Saudis don’t exactly prioritise press freedom. Todd offers an equation which explains 911: “Maximum incomprehension + intimate association  hatred.” On the other hand, we shouldn’t be so Russophobic. We are closer to Russia (1.5 distance) than Germany (2.5).But however inidualist, we are never going to give up the sense of wanting to belong. We all need a club to support (mine, for example, is West Ham, although if there was an East Ham team I’d probably support them, having been born in East Ham Memorial Hospital). Similarly, we readily fall back on the idea of a nation. It’s what makes the World Cup competitions so irresistible. The more global, the more tribal. It’s pure palindromic history. Even hunter-gatherers had to band together to bring down a mammoth. Doing something about climate control could be a great opportunity for collective effort. Our problem is we have never yet discovered a form of solidarity that doesn’t automatically encode a desire to annihilate the competition. Or as Todd puts it:\u0026nbsp“Group cohesion depends on hostility to other groups ... Peace is a social problem.”Emmanuel Todd is an anglophile Frenchman who studied in Cambridge. He reveres the British empiricists and fondly cites AJ\u0026nbspAyer’s Language, Truth, and Logic as a way of cutting through the French over-preoccupation with words. He also credits The Beatles with doing more to undermine the Soviets than the CIA. He tends to think of the European Community as a doomed and deluded project, “a rigid and hierarchical system”. In an almost scientific way, extrapolating from existing data, he is willing to offer a few predictions about the way things are going. I like his theory of zombie religions: “Protestantism and Judaism are dead even though they think they are alive.” In the future we can expect to see more feminism and a greater indifference to gender. But also less (in certain parts of the world). Hence more polarisation.The bifurcation of the sexes took place only a few billion years ago. If palindromic history is anything to go by, and the future increasingly resembles the past, we can expect to see a time when the sexes and sex will fade away. Kids will pop up out of vats and get to select their parents for a change and tell them what beliefs to adopt. Or we give up the notion of reproducing altogether. Finally the bubble bursts, light is extinguished, and the whole shebang folds up and shrinks into a lonesome, colourblind, extremely dense particle and we are crushed into a singularity. Even though there is no more “we”. Only “one”. And then none.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’. He teaches at the University of Cambridge.

But might history actually be on the side of the new movement, asks Adam LusherClick to followThe IndependentMarkus Keaney, local Labour chair, says Shuker would be annihilated in a by-electionIt’s not every day you get to rock a flat cap and give a Trotsky turn of phrase to the BBC News from Luton.\u0026nbspBut Markus Keaney, chair of Luton South Constituency Labour Party, managed it all this week, when\u0026nbsphe discussed his recently departed ex-comrade Gavin Shuker, the constituency’s MP.Keaney looked forward to the day when the defector to the Independent Group would be “consigned to the dustbin of history” and\u0026nbsp“annihilated” by an official Labour candidate at a by-election.\u0026nbspHis words were uttered\u0026nbspwith the cold rage of a man who knows his local party committee procedure and is prepared to use it in the cause of “passionate new members enthused by the promise of a break from neoliberalism” – as he described the post-Jeremy Corbyn intake in his September\u0026nbspMorning Star article, written after a\u0026nbspno-confidence vote taken by party members against\u0026nbspShuker was carried.But, to refer to the context in which Trotsky popularised the “dustbin of history” line, who here were the doomed Mensheviks, and who the 1917 Bolsheviks arising to greet the new post-Capitalist dawn?\u0026nbspAs the Independent Group went cross-party with the arrival of three defecting Conservatives, were we witnessing the start of something like Emmanuel Macron’s French En Marche!\u0026nbspmovement? Or would Keaney still get his annihilation moment?\u0026nbspShuker and the Labour splitCould it be the Corbyn project that is doomed?\u0026nbspPerhaps lessons could be learned in Luton, a town with some claim to being a bit of a bellwether.\u0026nbspUntil\u0026nbspShuker upset the trend by getting elected for Labour in 2010, the Luton South constituency had gone to the party that won the general election in every contest since 1951.Created with Sketch.Which MPs have defected from parties to join the Independent Group?

You never change things from the outside. He should stand his ground and try to f***ing sort it from inside.”There might be another party we could vote for, with our vote meaning something, not the current dual system. A bit like the Gang of Four. That didn’t happen, did it? But I am a born optimistAnd yet. The more you spoke to Gallagher, and his workmates, and others, the more you sensed a certain sympathy for Shuker and the points he was making about “abuse” in the party, about failure to oppose hard Brexit, and about Jeremy Corbyn.Painter and decorator John Brydson, 68, initially described himself as a Tory-voting Brexit supporter. But it turned out the backstory was more tangled, in ways that might favour Shuker, not Corbyn. “I was Labour for 50 years,” said Brydson.\u0026nbsp“But when Corbyn came in, I changed to Tory.\u0026nbspThere will never be a Labour government while he is at the head of the Labour Party.”Shuker was one of seven Labour members to quit the party on Monday\u0026nbsp(PA)He too didn’t like the way Shuker had left the party. “But yeah, I would vote for him, even though the way he went about it was wrong.”There was a moment of reflection when you mentioned\u0026nbspKeaney’s prediction that a by-election would see Shuker “annihilated” by an official Labour candidate.\u0026nbsp“I don’t think so,” said Mr Brydson softly.MPs: Joan Ryan,\u0026nbspHeidi Allen, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston (Reuters)Gallagher, meanwhile, seemed to be moving a long way in a short discussion, from “absolute rubbish” to “fair play to him”.\u0026nbspHe was an unwavering Labour man, he insisted: “All my life, working-class, always vote Labour.”But when you put him on the spot, and ask\u0026nbsphim to pick sides in a by-election fight between Shuker and a Keaney-approved Corbyn Labour candidate, there was a long pause.\u0026nbsp“Christ, you would have to go with Shuker, wouldn’t you?\u0026nbspYou would have to go sensible. The bloke with the cap, a proper lefty, wasn’t he?\u0026nbspToo much hatred in his voice, I thought.”The more ardent anti-neoliberal Corbynistas may not wish to be reminded of the old aphorism that the Labour Party owes more to Methodism than Marxism.\u0026nbspBut it was impossible to ignore as you sat in the Hardware Cafe\u0026nbspand pondered the new battle for the soul of British politics.\u0026nbspThe view from the cafe windows was dominated by the Mount Tabor Primitive Methodist Chapel, built 1897, grandeur unfaded, the names of the Victorian worthies who supported the project carved in stone for all to see.\u0026nbspMethodism still seemed to be triumphing over Marxism in 2019.\u0026nbspAl Short, 51, social worker and Christian, arrived.\u0026nbspHe still believed in the ideals of 2015, when Corbyn was promising a “kinder, gentler politics”. He regarded the Labour leader as “a pretty principled, genuine kind of guy, who cares for the poor, offers a genuine alternative.”And yet in a very gentle, very Christian kind of way, and despite his vote for Brexit, Short seemed to be warming to Shuker and this new Independent Group.\u0026nbsp“I am a Christian.\u0026nbspGavin Shuker is a Christian. I have a sense of rapport with him.”He even went as far as hoping the gang of 11\u0026nbsp(and counting) could prove a more successful update of the Gang of Four, who for a brief 1980s flurry had\u0026nbsplooked as if they might reshape British politics by leaving Labour and forming the SDP.Shuker (right) with his colleagues announcing their breakaway\u0026nbsp(PA)Short smiled, as if imagining a mildly exciting future: “There might be another party we could vote for, with our vote meaning something, not the current dual system. A bit like the Gang of Four. That didn’t happen, did it?\u0026nbspBut I am a born optimist.”Shuker will face an altogether feistier proposition in Short’s support-worker colleague Lorna Calliste, 42, east London-born daughter of a Trinidadian mother, now a mum to four kids by an Irish builder, and a committed Brexit supporter.\u0026nbsp“No, no, no,” was the unequivocal response to Shuker’s talk of taking a stand against “hard Tory Brexit”.But if Calliste wasn’t exactly brimming with excitement for Shuker and the Independent Group, she didn’t seem a natural fit with\u0026nbspCorbyn’s Labour either.\u0026nbsp“Labour has\u0026nbspgone silly.\u0026nbspThey want to let everyone in the country.\u0026nbspWhy can’t we have an Australian system where we let someone in if they have something to offer?”In the Hardware Cafe, you began to sense that going against his constituency’s Brexit vote would not fatally undermine Shuker, and that, however fuzzily, other elements of what the Independent Group was saying had hit home.Luciana Berger’s message was remembered, even if her name wasn’t (PA)Luciana Berger may exist in the Luton South consciousness as “the lady with the dark hair”, but many agreed with her that “what’s happening with the antisemitism is disgusting”.\u0026nbspAnd the notion that politics is “broken” sold itself.Stephen McNeilly had been excited by politics, once.\u0026nbspNow the 39-year-old electrician placed himself firmly in the camp of “the name Gavin Shuker rings a bell”.\u0026nbspHis disillusion with politics was a badge of pride, enlivened by references to Corbyn as “an absolute plank” to Brexit as a “f***ing shambles” to former Luton South MP Margaret Moran, whose life fell apart when she was caught “fiddling her expenses”.My son, his friends, many young people: they don’t know what happened in the past, and they want to give Corbyn a tryAnd yet, in almost the same lament, McNeilly seemed to be crying out for someone to inspire him and all the others languishing in the ranks of the disillusioned.\u0026nbsp“There’s no Martin Luther King figure,” he said.\u0026nbsp“No one with fresh ideas, no one with a voice, to make people stand up and listen.”Vividly expressed disillusion began to sound a little like an open invitation to Shuker and his Independent Group – all the more so when McNeilly turned to his own, conflicted feelings about having voted Leave.MPs have left the Labour party to form independent group“Every single thing I voted for – stopping immigration first and foremost – will be made null and void.\u0026nbspWe’re going to be financially crippled, kicked in the teeth. The dreadful thing is,\u0026nbspI would want to reverse it and vote Remain.”Perhaps all the conversations seemed to be running Shuker’s way.Why the Independent Group won’t succeed without electoral reformCabinet ministers back new Independent Group, claim Tory defectorsEx-Tory MP says battle for party is over as Brexit hardliners have wonBut then, Edward, a rather thoughtful 68-year-old, looked up from his book, and wondered whether we might be seeing things through a bit of a mainstream media haze.\u0026nbsp“My son’s 29,” said Edward, “And, I think, rather fooled by Corbyn.\u0026nbspSomehow Corbyn has got into young people, by young person’s media.\u0026nbspI suppose I am a centrist dad.\u0026nbspI’m so old I remember the Labour government of the 1970s that led us into trouble, into strikes.“But my son, his friends, many young people: they don’t know what happened in the past, and they want to give Corbyn a try.”But do they really, still?\u0026nbspThe University of Bedfordshire’s campus offered the chance of a probably wildly unscientific straw poll of the much-discussed millennial generation.\u0026nbspIt left you wondering whether the fever of Corbyn-mania may have cooled somewhat since the heady days of the June 2017 general election.Kieran Nixon, 23, was president of the student union, but when he spoke in a personal capacity he began to sound like a lot of others on campus.\u0026nbspHe voted Labour in 2015 because his parents did.\u0026nbspHe voted Labour in 2017 because of genuine enthusiasm for Corbyn.\u0026nbsp“He kind of set up this persona,” said Nixon, “that he was new, fresh, ‘down with the kids’, articulate.\u0026nbspI saw him going to festivals, saying he would clear the student loan debt.“But now it just feels like it was a pipe dream.\u0026nbspI don’t think I can see him being prime minister.\u0026nbspHe seems short of ideas, too quick to pass the blame to Theresa May.\u0026nbspHe doesn’t come up with any worthwhile solution to Brexit that could get accepted by Brussels.”“Maybe,” said Nixon, recalling that summer when he was 20 months younger and Corbyn was at Glastonbury, “going to festivals doesn’t really say professionalism.”Daisie Johnson: ‘The world seems in turmoil, but I don’t hear much about Corbyn opposing Brexit’ (Adam Lusher)Daisie Johnson also liked the Glastonbury appearance, at the time.\u0026nbsp“Corbyn tries to talk to young people,” said the psychology and criminal behaviour student. “Which is more than you can say for Theresa May.”But now, the full impact of the EU referendum – in which she was too young to participate – has hit home:\u0026nbsp“The world seems in turmoil, but I don’t hear much about Jeremy Corbyn opposing Brexit.\u0026nbspThat doesn’t seem to come up on the news feed.\u0026nbspI’m probably more for this other guy if he is against Brexit and Corbyn isn’t.”So no,\u0026nbspJohnson didn’t know who “this other guy” Shuker was.\u0026nbspAnd she didn’t really see how the Independent Group could turn a bit of House of Commons seating rearrangement into real change.\u0026nbsp“Where’s the majority to do anything? I don’t really get it.”Soubry and Sarah Wollaston join their new honourable friends\u0026nbspin the House of Commons (PA)But nor did McNeilly really get it when we began talking, and now he was at least a little interested.\u0026nbsp“I’ll try to catch a glimpse of what he’s saying,” said the 39-year-old.\u0026nbsp“More power to the guy: a journey of 1,000 miles starts with one step.”So what if that first step will be Shuker telling us who he is? They sneered at Macron to begin with, and he made it into the Elysee, avoiding the dustbin of history.\u0026nbspKeaney might be annoyed, but perhaps Shuker can take comfort in the fact there was even a time when no one knew who Trotsky and the Bolsheviks were either.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The new project that has not only envisioned but created such a molecule.“Life detection is an increasingly important goal of NASA’s planetary science missions, and this new work will help us to develop effective instruments and experiments that will expand the scope of what we look for,” said Lori Glaze, acting director of NASA’s Planetary Science Division.European Space Agency announces name of brand new Mars roverThe new research saw scientists create a new kind of molecule system that functions like DNA, but has an important difference. Instead of the usual four ingredients, it contains eight.It has all of the four that are found in life on Earth:\u0026nbspadenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine. But it has four extra, synthetic ones, that mimic the structures of the ingredients found in regular DNA.The researchers call the new creation hachimoji” DNA – hachi means eight in Japanese, and moji means letter. It functions the same as our DNA, meeting the same requirements that allow it to store and transmit information.That has meant that the kinds of molecules that might be storing information in life on alien worlds could be similarly different. It suggests that life could structure itself in different ways than it does on Earth, at the most fundamental level – meaning that environments Earth-bound life could never live in might be teeming with unimagined life forms.“Incorporating a broader understanding of what is possible in our instrument design and mission concepts will result in a more inclusive and, therefore, more effective search for life beyond Earth,” said Mary Voytek, senior scientist for Astrobiology at NASA Headquarters.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They use futuristic motors to allow them to be precisely tightened up automatically, without any shoelaces or other input.All of that can be controlled by an app, which allows people to slip on the shoes and then let the motors do the work of tightening them up, in a way shoelaces would traditionally work.

Well, good things come to those who wait. The iconic 1461s from heritage Midlands brand Dr Martens are now also being made in a super shiny synthetic material that mimics patent leather, so that everybody – men included! – can bring a touch of rockstar to their footwear. The inner sole is worth paying that bit for – it’s air-cushioned and resistant to oil, meaning no slipping and blisters. We were relieved to find that these didn’t need to be broken in like other Docs do – they were comfy from the first day of wearing them and looked slick with trousersleggings or a grungy dress. Colour-wise, you can choose from black, the cherry red (seen here), silver chrome or rose gold chrome.Firstly, yes, these are Star Wars-themed trainers (think rubber Rebel Alliance badge, Star Wars logo and galactic silver colouring), so if you’re not a fan of the movie space saga, they might not be for you. If you or a friend are, however, they’ll make the perfect affordable footwear gift. They slip on and are fantastically comfortable from the off. The outer is made with linen and Pinatex (a fibre made from pineapple leaves), the lining is organic cotton canvas and the insole is made from cork and natural latex, which moulds to your natural foot shape. Islington-born brand Po-Zu (meaning to pause in Japanese) is not entirely vegan, but much of its offering is, and all shoes are ethically produced in Portuguese or Sri Lankan factories using sustainable materials. For the height of vegan sophistication, no-one does brogues better than Will’s Vegan Store in London. Made with a kind of Italian faux leather created from plants and organic bio oil, they are fully decked out with the traditional brogue trim. Our top colour pick is the tan – it shows up all that intricate stitching beautifully – but they come in black or dark brown too. The durable rubber soles offer strong grip, the comfy insoles are made with recycled rubber and there’s a small block heel for added suave. Sizing is regular though if you normally look for halves, go one up. The Vegan Society has given this entire range the green light, and Will’s is a carbon neutral company that only uses plastic-free packaging, making this the ultimate in ethical browsing.411 Merrell all out crush 2 gore-tex: £120, MerrellFor the more active vegans among you, trustworthy trainers are a must-buy. US brand Merrell often pops up as a go-to brand for its small but reliable range of versatile shoes and after trying a pair for ourselves, we can see why. This lightweight pair of colourful kicks are built from Gore-Tex, a synthetic material, which is breathable and waterproof so will protect your feet in all running conditions. The heel is lined with lycra to help prevent rubbing and the sole boasts an impressive grip, even through slippy mud. In fact, these were designed especially with Tough Mudder-type challenges in mind. Expect your arches to feel well-supported, with plenty of room for broader feet. They come in black too, but why go boring when you can go jazzy with these bright blue, pink and coral dazzlers? Half sizes are also available.What we love about Birks is that you’re offered the choice between regular width (on the wide side) and narrow width, meaning everyone can find a pair of sandals to live in next summer, regardless of the shape of their feet. These have criss-crossed straps that are more slender than the classic design you might be used to. They’re made from Birko-Flor – essentially PVC with a breathable fleece-like lining. Its look mimics leather’s two-tone effect and feels just as gentle on the skin while being easier to clean. It’s win-win. The footbed, meanwhile, is the German footwear giant’s standard cork with arch support, only it’s lined with microfibre, not suede. The sole is made from an elastic material with excellent cushioning. Our pick of the three colours is the cream (pair it with any summer dress imaginable), but we might have to splurge on the dark grey and rose too. Here’s hoping they offer a vegan version of the yellow ones soon.611 Collection \u0026amp Co porto black lace up brogues: £120, Collection \u0026amp CoFor something that bit edgier, check out the new, fully vegan, Bristol-based footwear brand Collection \u0026amp Co, who are doing all sorts of cool things with waste materials in an effort to be more sustainable. We fell in love with these lace-up brogues, which come in jet black or rusty orange. They’re made in small, ethically-run Portuguese factories from soft faux leather, with faux suede side panels to add textural interest to the design. They slip on and off and have padded insoles for extra comfort, while rubber soles will withstand a pounding of the streets on a shopping mission. The 4cm block heels add a glam bit of height, although shoe lovers with wider feet might want to go for a size up as these are a bit on the narrow side. Oh, and they’ve got Peta’s seal of approval, too.Go back to basics with some canvas shoes specially designed by minimalist British shoe company VivoBarefoot to mimic the sensation of being barefoot and free. These dotty delights are handmade in Ethiopia in partnership with social enterprise, Soul of Africa, which supports education projects for disadvantaged kids. Even the print – choose from black or natural – has been designed in collaboration with local painters. Canadian accessories brand Matt \u0026amp Nat totally shun all animal-derived materials, so you can shop conscience-free (sorry, reader’s bank balance). These 3-inch block heeled Chelsea boots caught our eye, and certainly do away with any preconceptions that vegan shoes can’t be ethical, comfortable and stylish. In fact, the company’s motto is live beautifully, in more ways than one. The Peta-approved Kalistas have a sophisticated pointed toe and are made from black imitation leather, which you’d never know wasn’t the real deal. They pull on easily thanks to a smart elasticated ankle panel and came up true to size, while the gum rubber sole is hard-wearing enough to see you through those long days dashing between meetings – and finally to the pub afterwards!Every woman needs a reliable pair of black stiletto heels, be it for work, play or both. These faux leather beauties from Brighton-based vegan footwear brand Beyond Skin were recommended to us by a vegan pal who was overjoyed to find some plastic-made shoes that didn’t rub and give her blisters (it doesn’t give as well as leather does, though). Handmade in Spain, they have pointed toes, a breathable faux leather lining made from recycled materials and a heel of roughly 9cm. Peta has given them the thumbs up, so you can strut down the corridor feeling ethically awesome. No wonder Oscar-winning actor Natalie Portman is one of many famous fans. Some sizes may be out of stock online but we’ve been assured that they’ll be back in shortly, with pre-orders sent out in early March – so don’t panic!M\u0026ampS deserves a shout-out as a high street store with a huge range of vegan shoes that aren’t just kind to animals, but well-made and chic too. We were drawn to these metal trim loafers, which come in cheery cherry red or classic black and offer women with broader feet a wide fit option. The man-made material mimics suede (so be careful in rainy weather) and has an elegant check lining. They’re an absolute steal at just £25 a pair, and so comfy you’ll forget to take them off when you get home from a long day’s slog. The only downside is that there are no half sizes – if in doubt size up and grab some insoles.Roll back to the Seventies with these laid-back corduroy kicks from Californian footwear favourite Toms. Though not a vegan brand per se, the company offers an extensive range of shoes that are. These sneakers, inspired by the Sunshine State’s seaside towns, shot straight to the top of our must have list as they tick our three boxes: ethical, comfortable and cool. They’re also not like any shoes we’ve spotted elsewhere, so expect compliments from admiring strangers on the street. Though blissfully lightweight to wear with a cushioned insole, they’re also sturdy thanks to a rubber sole. Our faves are the turquoise, but the spicy red ones are hot too. Catch ‘em while they’re 40 per cent off in the sale and you could even justify buying both, especially as for every pair sold, Toms gives another to an underprivileged child.

The latter arrived with the announcement that Green Book had beaten out the category’s frontrunner, Roma, to Best Picture. It was a dismal reminder that progress is a slow, tedious process. Had Roma prevailed it would have made history, becoming both the first foreign language film and the first film distributed by Netflix (or any other streaming service) to win Best Picture.It would have been a win that actually felt like the Academy was looking towards the future, smashing through the strict confines that have so far determined what we deem awards worthy and allowing this yearly celebration of film to finally start reflecting how erse (on every possible level) the art form actually is.But alas, no. Instead the Academy chose a film that has faced widespread criticism for its use of the “white saviour” trope, since its story of a friendship between two real-life figures – black jazz musician Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) and his white driver Tony Vallelonga (Viggo Mortensen) – depicted the experiences of black Americans in the segregated South almost entirely through a white perspective.Crucially, it ignored the realities of racism in order to deliver a neat story about Tony’s redemption as a racist man who learns to become a more tolerant person. Green Book’s win tonight doesn’t feel like much of a victory. It’s more of a case of the same old, same old when it comes to the Oscars.\u0026nbspClarisse LoughreyColman wins actress in leading roleIt’s a win that many hoped for, but one that not many genuinely expected. Colman beat frontrunner Glenn Close to Best Actress, delivering a delightful (and thoroughly English) acceptance speech to boot. “It’s genuinely quite stressful,” she said. “This is hilarious. I got an Oscar! Okay, I have to thank lots of people. If, by the way, I forget anybody, I’m going to find you later and give you all a massive snog.”Granted, Close has been wildly overdue when it comes to the Oscars, having failed to win the past six times she’s been nominated – it seems particularly outrageous now that she wasn’t awarded either for 1988’s Dangerous Liaisons and 1987’s Fatal Attraction.Yet, Colman’s handling of Queen Anne’s various comedies and tragedies in The Favourite soars above any other film performance this year. A figure pathetic, fearsome, and desperate at all moments, Queen Anne is filled with endless conflicting layers, all effortless delivered by Colman. Thanks to Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara’s masterful screenplay, The Favourite was one of the greatest possible platforms for what a unique talent Colman is.\u0026nbspClarisse\u0026nbspLoughreyNo one has enjoyed awards season more than Richard E Grant. The 62-year-old star of Can You Ever Forgive Me? was, in his own words, “granted temporary membership to the A-list fame club” after the role earned him an Oscar nomination. Given the adorable viral video he posted in reaction to the nod, the countless selfies with every Hollywood actor he comes across, and the interviews in which he’s grinning ear to ear, it’s clear Grant decided to grab the opportunity with both hands.He didn’t grab the Oscar, though. That honour, predictably, went to Mahershala Ali for his role as jazz pianist Don Shirley in the somewhat controversial Green Book.\u0026nbspAli is brilliant, of course – just look at his previous Oscar-winning role in Barry Jenkins’ Moonlight – but wouldn’t it have been wonderful if Grant had managed to pull off a surprise victory? This was his first ever nomination, 32 years after he was snubbed for his iconic role in Withnail and I, and he plays Jack Hock – the playful, conniving, antagonistic friend to Melissa McCarthy’s Lee Israel – like no one else could.\u0026nbspAlexandra PollardMalek wins Actor in leading role: \u0027 We made a film about a gay man, an immigrant\u0027Although Green Book walked away with Best Picture, the film with the most wins of the night was Bohemian Rhapsody. It’s news that will also come as a significant disappointment to many. Alongside three wins in the technical categories – for Best Sound Mixing, Best Film Editing, and Best Sound Editing – Rami Malek also picked up Best Actor for his role as Freddie Mercury.The film, however, has been argued by many to be nothing but a karaoke-style paean to Queen, with many critics picking up on how the film downplays the AIDS crisis of the 1980s - Mercury was diagnosed with HIV in 1986 and died of AIDS-related bronchopneumonia in 1991 - and Mercury’s sexuality. Indeed, the film focuses solely on Mercury’s relationship with Mary Austin (played in the film by Lucy Boynton), leaving his relationship with Jim Hutton (Aaron McCusker), who was with Mercury until his death, as an epilogue untold, leading to accusations that the project “straight-washes” or “de-queers” its subject.It should be mentioned, crucially, that Academy voters made their decision in the light of the allegations facing Bohemian Rhapsody’s director, Bryan Singer. Last month, The Atlantic published multiple accusations that Singer had sexually abused underage boys. The director denies all allegations. That the Academy sees fit to reward the film in any way has, inevitably, made a statement about how the film industry reckons with the work of alleged abusers.\u0026nbspClarisse\u0026nbspLoughreyCreated with Sketch.

Regina King won Best Supporting Actress for her role in If Beale Street Could Talk, BlackKklansman director Spike Lee finally won an Oscar after decades of snubs, and Black Panther’s costume designer Ruth Carter, and its production designer Hannah Beachler, both became the first ever African American winners in their categories.Still, the fact that there are still firsts like these in 2019 is a pretty sorry state of affairs – and the fact that the night ended with Green Book, with all its problematic racial politics, winning Best Picture shows there is still work to be done.\u0026nbspAlexandra PollardSee all the action as it happened\u0026nbspbelow.Oscars Winners list in fullBest jokes, from Melissa McCarthy\u0027s rabbit to Amy Poehler’s Fyre Festival quipLady Gaga and Bradley Cooper receive standing ovation for \u0027Shallow\u0027 performanceOlivia Colman’s wonderfully English acceptance speech in fullFour years after #OscarsSoWhite, the Academy Awards headed towards redemption, but fell at the final hurdleHello and welcome to The Independent\u0027s liveblog for the\u0026nbspOscars 2019!\u0026nbspFrom now until the conclusion of the biggest night in film, we\u0027re going to be bringing you the latest updates, news, pictures and reactions to the Academy Awards, which takes place tonight at the Dolby Theater in Hollywood, Los Angeles.The race for the Best Picture award seems incredibly close this year.

In Inglourious Basterds, Waltz plays terrifying Nazi colonel Hans Landa, while in Django Unchained, he seems a world apart playing benevolent dentist-cum-bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz. Both roles were rewarded with Oscars for Best Supporting Actor.Spacey won two Oscars, for The Usual Suspects in 1996 and American Beauty in 2000. After numerous allegations of sexual assault emerged in 2017, the actor was removed from the Ridley Scott film All the Money in the World, and Christopher Plummer was given a Best Supporting Actor nomination after reshooting Spacey’s scenes in his stead.Swank won two awards for Best Actress, for Boys Don’t Cry and Million Dollar Baby. Accepting the award for the former, Swank neglected to thank her then-husband, Chad Lowe. Girls star Lena Dunham would later thank Lowe when she received a Golden Globe in 2013, tweeting that she did it “because Hilary Swank forgot.”Leigh’s performances as Scarlett O’Hara in Gone with the Wind in 1939 and as Blanche DuBois in the Tennessee Willimas adaptation A Streetcar Named Desire in 1951 stand as two of the most iconic in film history. The actress was fittingly rewarded for the roles, taking home a Best Actress trophy each time.Wiest appeared in five films by writer-director Woody Allen, winning Best Supporting Actress awards for her roles in Hannah and Her Sisters and Bullets Over Broadway. She is currently a regular on the CBS sit-com Life in Pieces.Ustinov was a highly acclaimed performer – with two Academy Awards to his name, for Spartacus and Topkapi – but was in no way limited to acting. Ustinov held a panoply of other occupations, including as a writer, a dramatist, a filmmaker, a director of theatre and opera, a humorist, a newspaper columnist, a radio broadcaster and a TV presenter. The son of a stage and silent film actor who was a victim of Hollywood’s transition to sound, Jason Robards was blessed with more success in the industry, eventually winning two Academy Awards. The actor appeared in numerous stage and screen adaptations of Eugene O’Neill plays, but it was his work in All the President’s Men that bagged him his first Best Supporting Actor statuette, doubling his tally the next year, in 1977, with Julia.Douglas won two Oscars, for Hud (1963) and for acting alongside a revelatory Peter Sellers in Being There (1969). The actor was known for being an outspoken anti-fascist ever since visiting Europe in 1931 with his wife, Helen Gahagan, who served three terms as a US Congresswoman, running against Richard Nixon for Governor in 1950.Over the course of her 63-year career, Winters appeared in successful blockbusters such as The Poseidon Adventure. But it was her more nuanced supporting roles in 1960’s The Diary of Anne Frank and 1965’s A Patch of Blue that would win over Academy voters, for which she collected two awards in the category.Quinn is something of an anomaly in the ranks of multiple Oscar-winners. The actor was born in Chihuahua, Mexico, in 1915, to a Mexican mother and an Irish father, and is one of one only five actors with a Latin-American background to win an acting Oscar – the others being Rita Moreno, José Ferrer, Mercedes Ruehl, and Benicio del Toro – and the only one to win twice. Roma nominees Yalitza Aparicio and Marina de Tavira are in contention this year.Jackson was one of the most accomplished actors of her generation, with two Best Actress wins under her belt by the age of 37 (for Women in Love and A Touch of Class). But starting in 1992, she took a 23-year sabbatical from the industry, serving as the Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn.Long before she was captivating younger audiences with her roles in the Harry Potter franchise and popular TV series Downton Abbey, Dame Maggie Smith had wowed Oscar voters with The Prime of Miss Jean Brody (1969), adding a Best Supporting Actress win for California Suite in 1978.Davis won her only two Best Actress Oscars in 1935 and 1938 – for Dangerous and Jezebel respectively –but over the course of her hugely successful six-decade career, she would continue to accrue more nominations, eventually becoming the first actor to reach a milestone of 10.Along with Helen Hayes, March is one of only two actors to win two Oscars and two Tony Awards. The multi-talented star won Best Actor for the bifurcated titular role in 1931’s horror adaptation Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, winning again in 1946 for The Best Years of Our Lives, a post-WWII drama about soldiers returning home from the war.Field’s Oscar win for Places in the Heart in 1985 has been immortalised by her acceptance speech – which included the infamous lines “you like me, right now, you really like me” - but the actor had already proven she was more than just a soundbite having won the same trophy for her star turn in Norma Rae five years earlier.Taylor gained 30 pounds for the 1966 black comedy Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, a film which sees her trapped in a poisonous marriage with a character played by her off-and-on real-life paramour Richard Burton. The star had previously nabbed a Best Actress award for her portrayal of a sex worker in BUtterfield 8, a film she claimed to dislike.After scooping up the Best Actor prize in 2003 for Mystic River, Penn won another for portraying iconic LGBT campaigner and US politician Harvey Milk, who was assassinated in 1978. Penn opened his victory speech with “Thank you. Thank you. You commie, homo-loving sons-of-guns!”Fargo Oscar-winner McDormand delivered a rousing address at the 2018 Oscar ceremony, demanding an end to Hollywood’s gender imbalance. The speech, made while accepting her second Best Actress prize - for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri - brought all the women in the audience to their feet in solidarity. She ended her speech with the phrase “inclusion rider,” a stipulation that can be put into a performer’s contract to ensure equal opportunity hiring on set.Hackman won his first Oscar playing “Popeye” Doyle in William Friedkin’s The French Connection – a taboo-busting cop thriller that was hardly the stuff of Academy tradition. 19 years later, his supporting turn as the villain in Clint Eastwood’s revisionist Western Unforgiven made it a double.Hanks made his name in romantic comedies with some successes in the 1980s, but his first Oscar win – for AIDS drama Philadelphia - was a big departure. The next year, in 1995, he won again, for the hugely popular Forrest Gump.Dame Olivia de Havilland, now 102 years old, is perhaps best known for her role in Gone with the Wind. Garnering five nominations across her career, de Havilland took home two statuettes in the 1940s, for To Each His Own and The Heiress.Next to Luise Rainer, Jodie Foster is the only other actor to have won two Oscars before the age of 30, for The Accused in 1988, and Silence of the Lambs in 1991. It’s a fitting record for an actor whose career took off while she was still a child, with breakout roles in Bugsy Malone and Taxi Driver.Sir Michael Caine, familiar around the globe for his distinctive cockney accent, once confessed that 1983’s Educating Rita was “the last good picture I made before I mentally retired.” In spite of this, the actor managed to win Oscars for Hannah and Her Sisters in 1986 and The Cider House Rules in 1999.Cooper won his first Best Actor Oscar in 1942 for Sergeant York. The famously stoic star didn’t turn up to collect his second award – for an understated turn in the classic Western High Noon – instead sending John Wayne, who said: Coop and I have been friends, hunting and fishing, for more years than I like to remember. He\u0027s one of the nicest fellows I know. I don\u0027t know anybody any nicer.”In 1982, Jessica Lange became the first star in nearly four decades to be nominated for two films in the same year, for Tootsie and Frances, the former of which yielded a win. Lange is currently tied as the sixth most nominated Actress in history.Initially winning at the same time as co-star Meryl Streep for Kramer Vs Kramer, Hoffman’s second Best Actor Oscar came for Rain Man in 1988, in a role which has been recognised as important in raising awareness of autism.The poster girl for the flower child generation, Jane Fonda was always expected to politicise the Oscars. After an unexpectedly reserved acceptance speech for Klute in 1972, she presented part of her 1979 speech – for Coming Home – in sign language.Following a supporting turn in 1974’s The Godfather Part II, Robert De Niro’s second Oscar-winning role, playing boxer Jake LaMotta in Raging Bull, is about as hard-earned as they come. The actor honed his boxing ability to professional standards, and gained approximately 60 pounds to play an older, washed-up version of the character.The Aviator is often dismissed as a minor Martin Scorsese film, but the Howard Hawks biopic won Blanchett her first Oscar in 2004. She would have to wait until Blue Jasmine seven years later - her sixth nominated performance, out of seven total - to win in the Best Actress category.Lemmon was legendary for his mastery of both comedy and pathos, and it was chiefly his humorous chops that saw him win Best Supporting Actor in 1955, for his role in Mister Roberts. With a follow-up win for Save the Tiger, the Some Like it Hot star became the first actor to claim Oscar wins in both the lead and supporting categories.Eight-time Oscar nominee Brando influenced a generation of actors with his revolutionary approaches to method, winning Hollywood’s biggest prize twice in the process - for On the Waterfront (1954) and The Godfather (1974). Brando famously sent Native American actress Sacheen Littlefeather to accept his second award in protest of the industry’s representation of Native Americans. Littlefeather later revealed the protest caused her to be blacklisted by many studios.Spencer Tracy won two Oscars from nine nominations for Best Actor. He holds the joint record for the most nominations in the category, along with Laurence Olivier, who won only once.Rainer has been described as the first victim of the so-called “Oscar curse”. The Austrian-American star won Best Actress twice in quick succession – for The Great Ziegfeld in 1936 and for The Good Earth in 1937 – which resulted in MGM studios eagerly miscasting her in a series of flops. This would lead to a 54-year break from cinema, before returning alongside Michael Gambon in 1997’s The Gambler.Helen Hayes holds the record for being the actor with the longest gap between two Oscar victories. A practiced stage actress, Hayes also appeared in a few silent films before making her debut ‘talkie’ The Sin of Madelon Claudet, for which she won Best Actress. Hayes’s next and final win would be for a supporting role in Airport, nearly 40 years later.Denzel Washington is the only black actor to win multiple competitive Academy Awards, for Glory in 1990 – a Best Supporting Actor award - and then Training Day in 2002. No African-American actor has won more than one award since, although Mahershala Ali could match his total should he win for Green Book.Brennan had originally started work as an extra after losing most of his money in the 1925 real estate slump, appearing (often uncredited) in over 120 films across the next decade. He would then win three Best Supporting Actor Oscars in the space of four years, for Come and Get It (1936), Kentucky (1938) and The Westerner (1940).Nicholson became regarded as one of the voices of his generation at the start of the 1970s with iconic roles in Easy Rider and Five Easy Pieces, but it took six nominations for him to win his first Oscar, for the Miloš Forman-directed One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest in 1976. He would later win two more, one for Terms of Endearment and the other for As Good as It Gets.Ingrid Bergman, the Swedish star who successfully crossed over to Hollywood in 1939, won three Oscars during her career, beginning with Gaslight in 1944. An extra-marital affair with director Roberto Rossellini in the early 1950s scandalised her American audience, but the success of Anastasia in 1956 brought her back into the bosom of the public favour and she won a second Best Actress trophy. She added a Supporting Actress honour in 1974 for Murder on the Orient Express, one of her last film projects.Sir Daniel Day-Lewis is the only male actor to win three Best Actor awards, for his roles in My Left Foot, There Will Be Blood and Lincoln. After writing himself into the annals of film history with his 2012 win for portraying the American president, Day-Lewis took a step back from the industry, appearing in only one film since – Paul Thomas Anderson’s Phantom Thread - which he has claimed is his final role. For Meryl Streep, Oscar nominations are nearly as regular as dental appointments. Streep’s name has appeared on the ballot a total of 21 times, 17 of which were in the Best Actress category, and she has won three times: for Kramer vs Kramer in 1980, Sophie’s Choice in 1983, and The Iron Lady in 2012.Katharine Hepburn boasts more Oscar victories – four – than any other actor, all in the Actress in a Leading Role category. Hepburn’s The Lion in Winter trophy was shared with Barbra Streisand in the only ever instance of a tied Best Actress result. Hepburn never attended any of the ceremonies.It was the Austrian-born actor’s long-running collaboration with controversial filmmaker Quentin Tarantino that brought him to the mainstream public consciousness. In Inglourious Basterds, Waltz plays terrifying Nazi colonel Hans Landa, while in Django Unchained, he seems a world apart playing benevolent dentist-cum-bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz.

The takeover target said on Monday that NSF\u0027s\u0026nbspapproach could have a “negative and destabilising impact on its stakeholders, including its customers” as it advised shareholders to take no action.Patrick Snowball, chairman of Provident, said: “The board of Provident Financial believes that the offer does not reflect the underlying value of the company and its prospects.“It also has a number of concerns with regard to the offer, including its all-share nature and the executability of the strategy set out in the offer.“The board therefore intends to do everything it can to maximise value for all shareholders over the coming weeks and will explore all appropriate alternatives to achieve that objective.”Provident went on to list its objections to the deal, including opposing the sale of disposing of its Moneybarn and Satsuma units.It also questioned NSF\u0027s track record and ability to manage a business of the scale of Provident.Investors must vote on whether to approve the deal, but it has already received the blessing of star fund manager Neil Woodford, Invesco and Marathon.“It is extremely disappointing that NSF has chosen to announce an unsolicited and highly opportunistic offer for Provident Financial,” said Mr Snowball.“Provident Financial\u0027s management team has stabilised the business in a very turbulent period over the past 18 months, which has largely consisted of addressing managerial mistakes of the past, and now has a clear strategy for delivering enhanced returns to shareholders.”Provident added on Monday that it is trading in line with expectations but, given the circumstances, the board will delay the announcement of its full-year 2018 results to March 13.Embattled Provident saw shares tumble in January after it warned that profits will be at the lower end of expectations.The group said it had seen a rise in bad debts at its Vanquis Bank arm and falling numbers of new accounts after clamping down on its lending.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Prices for the Galaxy S10 start at £799.As the name suggests, the S10+ is essentially a plus-sized version of the S10.Measuring 6.4-inches, the S10+ features the same triple-lens setup on the rear of the phone but adds another lens to the front.It can also hold an incredible\u0026nbsp1.5 terabytes of data – 500GB more than its nearest rival (the Galaxy Note9) – if its 512GB expandable memory is utilised.The battery on the S10+ is also enormous, though without real-world testing it\u0027s difficult to say how far this will go in an average user\u0027s day.Up to 12GB of RAM makes this smartphone more powerful than most modern laptops.Prices for the Galaxy S10+ start at £899The Galaxy S10 5G is huge – and not only because of its 6.7-inch frame.Its real significance comes in its support for 5G, the next-generation mobile network that will define communications for the next decade.This phone will appeal to anyone wanting to see what this new world might look like, though it\u0027s likely going to be at least a year before 5G rolls out on any significant scale.In terms of general specs, the Galaxy S10 5G is most similar to the Galaxy S10, with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage.\u0026nbspSamsung is yet to announce a price or exact\u0026nbsprelease date for the Galaxy S10 5G, though it will likely be coming at some point in the summer.While some may be questioning what the point of a folding phone is, others are heralding the Galaxy Fold as the future of smartphones.Like the S10 5G, this is a phone for early adopters, with future generations likely to iron out any kinks that may arise from such a radically new technology.It comes with 512GB of internal storage as standard, 12GB of RAM and an incredible six cameras.\u0026nbspSamsung is yet to announce the cost of the Galaxy Fold in the UK, but with prices in the US set at $1,980 and €2,000 in Europe, British buyers can expect to pay around £1,600.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Shares slumped again in january after another disappointing update.It emerged last year that new chief executive Rico Back had received a £6m payment when he joined from General Logistics Systems, a Dutch firm that Royal Mail owns.His total pay packet for this year could hit £2.7m while outgoing chief executive Moya Greene received a £900,000 payout.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Or at least that’s what we were told by Liam Fox in 2017.The confidence beaming from the international trade secretary as he set off on his world tour to convince governments to do business with “global Britain” was notably absent this week.With little to show for his efforts, Fox\u0026nbspwas\u0026nbspforced into an embarrassing climbdown, finally conceding that many of those\u0026nbsptrade deals had no chance of being ratified by 29 March.\u0026nbspSo where are we now – and why has Liam Fox fallen so far short of his own bar?No deal will be done in time with valuable trading partners Turkey and Japan, nor with the tiny European principalities of Andorra and San Marino.\u0026nbspCan UK continue trading with countries covered by an EU trade deal?Fox has so far delivered just six of the 40 deals he promised. The biggest positive he can point to is an agreement with Switzerland, a country which took £20bn of UK exports in 2017.By comparison, the UK shipped £278bn of goods and services to the EU in 2017. A deal with the trading bloc, Fox told us, would be “the easiest in human history”.\u0026nbspThe only other agreements he has so far been able to finalise in close to three years of toil account for a tiny percentage of UK trade. Israel is the largest among these, buying £2.4bn of UK goods and services, with £1.6bn flowing the other way.Agreements sealed with the Palestinian territories\u0026nbspand the Faroe Islands will do little to keep post-Brexit Britain afloat. We also have a deal with the 21 countries which make up the Common Market for\u0026nbspEastern and Southern Africa, but only Egypt accounts for anything more than a negligible amount of UK trade.Among the remaining countries in the group are two, which, according to official figures, imported no UK goods last year: Eritrea and Comoros.There is of course a chance that agreements will be reached in the next 35 days but Fox’s announcement hardly inspires confidence.He attempted to reassure the public with news that formal agreements are close with Fiji and Papua New Guinea.\u0026nbspBut that\u0026nbspsimply served\u0026nbspto highlight the lack of progress on agreements with far more important trading partners.True, we have some form of agreement with the US, Australia and New Zealand but these mostly cover product standards. They aren’t full trade deals.Created with Sketch.

Juergen Ziegler, CEO for Europe, said that while Brexit was not the only factor, it has brought forward the decision to relocate“Particularly intensive discussions” are happening with the European Economic Area, South African Customs Unions, Canada and South Korea, the trade secretary says – which sounds distinctly like they won’t be signed in time.It all seems like tinkering around the edges when you compare the figures involved to the vast sums of trade we conduct\u0026nbspwith the other 27 EU member states.None of this is to say that our trade secretary has been incompetent or lazy. No one said rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic was easy.\u0026nbspAnd negotiating trade deals is\u0026nbspeven more fiendishly complex – they frequently\u0026nbspamount to hundreds of clauses covering standards and tariffs on vast\u0026nbspnumbers of products.Deals often take\u0026nbspyears to finalise, even for skilled negotiators focused on one agreement, let alone 40.Whether through arrogance or ignorance, Liam Fox did not listen to trade experts who said dozens of EU deals could not be “rolled over” with ease.\u0026nbspHe assured everyone it could be done, but that was never truly the case.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

His comments come after US secretary of state Mike Pompeo\u0026nbspinsisted the US would not provide top-secret intelligence to countries which use equipment from\u0026nbspChinese tech giant Huawei\u0026nbspin their core networks.Mr Pompeo\u0026nbsptold Fox Business:\u0026nbsp“If a country adopts this and puts it in some of their critical information systems, we won’t be able to share information with them.”Last year, MI6 chief Alex Younger expressed his concern about the potential involvement of Huawei in the UK’s 5G mobile network.​ The company\u0026nbsphas denied it has any links to Chinese spying operations.In his address to government, military and industry figures from across southeast Asia, Mr Fleming will say no decisions have been taken on 5G, with a government review due to report in the spring.However he will say it is essential the potential risks of allowing Chinese firms to become involved need to be properly understood.He will say:\u0026nbsp”It’s a hugely complex strategic challenge which will  the next few decades ... probably our whole professional lives.“How we deal with it will be crucial for prosperity and security way beyond 5G contracts.”US signals it will refuse to share information if UK uses HuaweiHuawei founder says ‘no way the US can crush us’ Huawei threat to UK national security ‘can be contained’Huawei addresses spy concerns to UK governmentWith around half the 1,100 incidents handled by the UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) over the last two years involving state actors, Mr Fleming will say there is a need for an internationally agreed system of ethics and standards for operating in cyberspace.“Some of the behaviour we’ve seen from certain states or criminals is clearly wrong in any circumstance,” he will say. “An attack on a hospital’s IT, or on a country’s electoral system will always require sanction.“Unchecked, we’re heading for an even less governed space where rights and wrongs are not automatically recognised and where acceptable behaviours are not a given.Ultimately, he will say that Britain’s continuing security in cyberspace will depend on its ability to act together\u0026nbspwith international allies.He is expected to add: “Our future security will be guaranteed not by the quality of our coding, the design of our silicon, or the cunning of our cyber operators – but by the bonds that tie us together and the relationships that give us confidence to act decisively against common threats.”Additional reporting by PAWe’ll tell you what’s true.

Liberal Democrats have led the campaign for a people’s vote. We have campaigned for it, we have marched for it and we will vote for it.”With dissatisfaction over Brexit having sparked several Tory and Labour MPs to quit their party and form the Independent Group, Sir Vince said he has been speaking to “many of these now independent MPs” and that they have “much in common” with his party.Created with Sketch.

Parliament cannot stand by and allow this to happenAs Ms May announced she would not be able to put a new deal to the Commons, she said she would ensure that it does happen by 12 March\u0026nbspat the latest, and went on to signal that she would make an attempt to avert the frontbench rebellion on Wednesday, saying: “We don’t know what amendments are going to be tabled.“We don’t know what amendments are going to be selected. You haven’t even seen what motion the government is going to put down – as I say, it won’t be the meaningful vote.“I will be making a statement to parliament on Tuesday. And then, obviously, we’ll be having the debate the next day.”One option open to her could be to offer ministers and MPs who are worried about a no-deal Brexit\u0026nbspanother way to stop it from happening instead of backing the CooperLetwin amendment.But while the prime minister has already managed to push back attempts by MPs to back the proposal, Brexit day is now so close that many of those minded to support it believe this could be their last chance.Society’s poorest will suffer the most from Brexit unless we marchI joined a political party aged 13 – but Brexit’s pushed me to apathyHow we view our national identity is a great challenge to comeThe prime minister’s promise to bring her new deal before the Commons by 12 March is also significant, because if the CooperLetwin plan is passed on Wednesday it would require MPs to vote on the actual legislation delaying Brexit on 13 March.That means Ms May will have one final opportunity to get her deal through, and could also tell Tory Brexiteers that the UK’s departure would be delayed if they still refuse to back her withdrawal agreement on that day.The PM’s move to delay bringing any new deal before the house was attacked by critics in the UK and on the continent. Ms Cooper branded Ms May’s actions “utterly shambolic and irresponsible”.The Labour MP added: “She cannot just keep drifting and dithering like this or there is a real risk our whole country tumbles off a cliff edge into a chaotic no deal that no one is ready for and that would hit food prices, medicine supplies, manufacturing and security.”Gove says ‘no deal’ Brexit could lead to higher food pricesShadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer called Ms May’s decision over the timing of the meaningful vote “an admission of failure”, adding that it represents “the height of irresponsibility”.He went on: “Theresa May is recklessly running down the clock in a desperate attempt to force MPs to choose between her deal and no deal. Parliament cannot stand by and allow this to happen.”Ms May met European Council president Donald Tusk for talks on Sunday afternoon, and was set to hold a number of meetings with European leaders on the fringes of the summit she is attending in Egypt.But at least one senior European figure was unhappy with her decision to delay the vote. The European parliament’s Brexit spokesman Guy Verhofstadt said on Twitter that he had “seen many surprising decisions in a lifetime in politics. But this is close to being one of the most reckless.”There were even uncorroborated reports that EU officials were looking at delaying Brexit to 2021 to allow time to fully plan an orderly withdrawal.Josh Hardie, CBI deputy director-general, said of Ms May’s announcement: “This is the latest signal to businesses that no deal is hurtling closer.“It must be averted. Every day without a deal means less investment and fewer jobs created. That’s the cost of running down the clock, and it’s irresponsible to treat that as a price worth paying.”\u0026nbspWe’ll tell you what’s true.

But this is close to being one of the most reckless.”Labour had said the decision to delay the vote was “the height of irresponsibility and an admission of failure”.Arriving at a summit in Egypt on Sunday the prime minister had said the delay was justified because “positive” talks were taking place with the EU that could produce a solution to the backstop.The PM’s claim is however not reflected in Brussels, where officials have expressed bemusements at repeated visits from the prime minister and her ministers. Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, said last week that he was not optimistic at the prospect of avoiding a no-deal following the meeting with Ms May, and that their talks had simply amounted to a chat.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentBritish negotiators will be returning to the EU capital on Tuesday, the prime minister confirmed.

Brexit day, 29 March, is so close that Ms May will find it difficult to convince MPs that they can vote for the plan in a few more weeks and still credibly implement it.There has been increasing speculation that many members of her front bench want to back it and take a no-deal Brexit off the table as well – including three members of her cabinet, David Gauke, Greg Clark and Amber Rudd, who wrote an open letter on the issue on Saturday morning.Cabinet ministers warn May they will delay Brexit to avoid no dealNew march for a People’s Vote receives £250,000 in matter of daysThe prime minister could choose to sack the ministers, but that might bring her whole government down. Then again if she allows them to vote against her will on Wednesday and does nothing, it will underline the weakness of her position in London, pass proposals that will weaken her negotiating stance in Brussels and make her chances of securing a deal less likely.A delay to Brexit also becomes almost inevitable, and other alternative outcomes – like MPs forming a cross-party coalition to secure the UK in permanent customs union – become more probable.Ms May’s only hope of avoiding this outcome is to beseech MPs and her own ministers not to back the CooperLetwin plan, by showing them she is within a hair’s breadth of clinching the withdrawal agreement she wants.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Heres the lowdown.On February , , seven MPs held a press conference to announce they were quitting the Labour party and forming a new Independent Group.It was the most signicant breakaway since the formation of the Social Democratic Party in the early s.On February  a ninth MP also quit and joined their group.The rebels are:They are furious at Jeremy Corbyns Brexit stance and his handling of the anti-Semitism scandal that still dogs the party.Jewish MP Luciana Berger - who has faced vicious abuse from left-wingers - said: I cannot remain in a party that I have come to the sickening conclusion is institutionally anti-Semitic.Chris Leslie said the party had been hijacked by the machine politics of the hard left.And Mr Gapes blasted: I am sickened that the Labour Party is now a racist and anti-Semitic party.The seven rebels from the centrist wing of the Labour party have called themselves The Independent Group.It already has a website although it had no content at the time of the announcement.Its Twitter account racked up more than , followers in the first hour after it was opened.It is thought they will sit as independents in the House of Commons, rather than forming an official party at this stage.Mr Umunna, seen as the most likely leader of the group, said: Fundamental change is needed.The established parties are not up to this change. They can’t be the change as they have become the problem.On February  Joan Ryan, chairman of Labour Friends of Israel, also quit the party over Jeremy Corbyns failure to deal with face of evil anti-Semitism.She slammed the Labour leader and the Stalinist clique that surrounds him and said he was not fit to be prime minister.MP Ian Austin quit the Labour Party over its “culture of extremism, anti-Semitism and intolerance.”The Member of Parliament for Dudley North, who is pro-Brexit, insists he will not be joining the newly formed Independent Group which is pushing for a second referendum.Rumours of a pending split in the Labour party have swirled since Jeremy Corbyn became leader in .And speculation reached a frenzy over the weekend amid reports a group of MPs would finally stage a walkout and launch a breakaway party.The confirmation by the seven rebels came after reports Labour moderates had reached breaking point over Jeremy Corbyns Brexit stance, particularly his refusal to back a second referendum.Former frontbencher Chuka Umunna said on Thursday he did not “give a damn... about keeping any party together” when compared to the overriding priority of the national interest in avoiding a No Deal Brexit.And ex-shadow chancellor Chris Leslie told the House of Commons Labour supporters are being “played for fools” by the leadership.On Friday, Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray said MPs were being pushed to the brink.Mr Murray refused to sign a provocative pledge shared on social media as part of efforts to shore up party unity, insisting his loyalty was not in question.He insisted his loyalty to Labour was not in question.On Sunday shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned a split would cost seats like the SDP breakaway in , which installed Mrs Thatcher in power for a decade.He told the BBC: I dont think any of the people whove even been mentioned about this split would want that.Former party deputy chairman Michael Dugher revealed in the Sun on Sunday on February  he was quitting Labour after  years because of anti-Semitism.He said: “It pains me to see what the Labour party has become.I can no longer justy paying subs to a party which I now regard as institutionally anti-Semitic.Mr Dugher stood down as an MP at the last election, but current MPs have long been said to be close to quitting and Brexit could be the tipping point for some.Up to  current MPs fear they will fall victim to a massive purge by new left-wing activists who have flooded the party.Ed Miliband and Yvette Cooper are among those said to be at risk of deselection.Some may decide to jump before they are pushed, switching to a new centrist party that has long been touted in Westminster.Moderates and Remainers have called on the Labour leader to throw his weight behind calls for a second referendum.Until Feb , fed-up MPs have shied away from quitting but the decision threw the party leadership into fresh turmoil.One of the potential splitters has reportedly told colleagues thatthey walk away they want to “burn the house down” on their way out.They will hope backbench colleagues will follow them out the door, Westminster watchers say.Another crunch point could come ahead of a Commons vote on February  on Theresa Mays Brexit plans.Some backbenchers are reportedly planning to submit an amendment calling for a Peoples Vote, which is not sanctioned by the party leadership.Sources claim ten more Labour MPs are ready to quit and join The Independent Group, plus six Tories could join them.One senior Labour figure said: “It’s a matter of time before others go.“I think you’ll see another ten at least leave Labour in a matter of weeks.“The Independents could be the fourth biggest political party by Easter Sunday.”One insider added that he also expected Labour peers Waheed Alli, Margaret McDonagh, John Reid to sit as Independents in the Lords.In a sign of Labour’s sht under Mr Corbyn, it separately emerged on Monday, February , that s militant Derek Hatton was back as a Labour party member after a  year exile. If Labour splitters started their own party, it would likely aim for the centre-left ground formerly occupied by Tony Blairs New Labour.They would pursue social democratic policies and would be against a hard Brexit, and possibly hoping to reverse Brexit altogether.As well as Labour MPs, the breakaway party would hope to attract Lib Dems and pro-EU Tories.But they would face a struggle to make an impact as the electoral odds are against smaller and less established parties.Part of the reason is the first-past-the-post voting system in general elections, which favours the two biggest parties.In  an alliance of the SDP - formed by breakaway Labour politicians - and the old Liberal party won more than  per cent of votes nationally but only  seats.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Likewise, consistently receiving less than you need to because you are paying back an advance can push people over the edge and into destitution.To succeed, Universal Credit needs to raise the incomes of those locked in poverty and ensure that work is a route to a better le. Without further reform, its potential risks being unfulfilled.The best immediate step the Government should take would be to lt the freeze on working age benefits this April.One million people are already receiving it and by the time the system is fully rolled out in , nearly  million will be on it.But there are big problems with the flagship new system - it takes  weeks to get the first payment and it could leave some families worse off by thousands of pounds a year.And while working families can claim back up to  per cent of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.It’s time to Make Universal Credit work. We want the Government to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Join our Universal Credit Facebook group or email UniversalCredit@the-sun to share your story. JRF also want jobcentres to better use the hidden pot called the Flexible Support Fund to help Brits with their childcare payments upfront so Brits dont go into thousands of pounds of debt going back to work.They highlighted the thoughts of both people on Universal Credit and work coaches in their new report.Research from Britain Thinks revealed that working parents saw Universal Credit as contributing towards their poor standards of living, and not helping them.Many wanted to be able to keep more of their hard-earned cash rather than being hit by the taper rate, and felt trapped by their circumstances.When the couple moved onto the new benefit system in September their £ a month benefits were immediately stopped, leaving them unable to pay their rent.The Peterborough couple, who’ve been living in their current home for a year now, claim they have nowhere  to gothey are evicted and will have to be put in temporary accommodation, at a cost of £ a week to the city council.Its a disgusting situation to be in because you know its going to happen but youre absolutely powerless to do anything about it, Amanda told The Sun.We have no savings, no one to fall back on and we struggle to be able to afford the rent now that we’re in debt.If were are relocated to a completely dferent area then Brian will have to give up his job but I thought the whole point of Universal Credit was to get people into work  It makes no sense.A DWP spokesperson said that the scheme works for the vast majority of people.They added: Universal Credit reduces gradually as people’s income increases, which means they’re always better off in work."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000470023516.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"anila baig nothing shamima believes is to do with being muslim","story":"She made her bed and now, however uncomfortable it is, she must lie in it.But you must know one thing. None of the widespread condemnation of her actions is a patch on the revulsion that comes from the British Muslim community itself.It was bad enough she joined IS as a -year-old but what makes my blood boil is how she repeatedly claims her actions were something to do with Islam.No, they really aren’t.Her support for a murderous cult is nothing to do with the Islam that I recognise.When asked about witnessing beheadings and executions she said she wasn’t bothered because she thought they were “Islamically OK”.No, they are not.This twisted, toxic interpretation of Islam is anathema to me — and it is certainly not something we grew up following as second-generation Muslims in this country.We were taught from a young age that Muslims had to be compassionate towards everyone, whatever their faith.I grew up in a mixed community in Bradford, where I still live.We always took presents to our Christian neighbours at Christmas and ate sweets with our Hindu neighbours at Diwali. We celebrated each other’s religious festivals and had friends from all dferent backgrounds. I always heard about how Islam meant peace and how the Prophet was well known for being kind, honest and gentle.Now, thanks to the actions of Begum and her ilk, people sneer when they hear the phrase “Religion of peace”.The truth is, that in the Koran there are strict rules about warfare. You are not even allowed to harm a tree, so targeting children at a pop concert is completely unthinkable.Still, Begum talks about how “unjust” the decision to boot her out of the UK is and repeatedly asks for sympathy.Sorry, but I reserve my sympathy for the rest of us in the Muslim community.Every single time there is an incident around the world we hold our breath, hoping and praying it was not a misguided “Muslim” behind the attack.Since   there has ALWAYS been a backlash, and it is ordinary, law-abiding Muslims who bear the brunt.According to one anti-racism charity there were more than , attacks on Muslims last year — a rise of  per cent — and women are disproportionately targeted.Women who wear the headscarf say they live in fear. They have been verbally abused, a few have even had their hijabs ripped off their heads — and Begum’s interviews will pour petrol on that fire.High-profile Muslim celebrities such as boxer Amir Khan posted on Twitter that “arrogant” Shamima is giving all Muslims a bad name. It is hard to disagree.The far right will gleefully tar us all with the same brush, using the actions of ONE inidual to paint the WHOLE community as traitors.Despite this, we know that Britain is not as racist as other countries in Europe.When I went to Paris I was told repeatedly that le for immigrants in France is very dficult. Spain and Italy are among other EU nations that continue to show naked hostility and xenophobia towards Muslims, both in the street and among their politicians. Sure, when our parents came here in the s and s they also had to endure dficulties, but a lot has changed since then.Areas such as Bethnal Green, where Begum comes from, is not a ghetto hotbed of radicalism.Muslim men, women and children live harmoniously next to bearded hipsters sucking on their soy lattes, and it is this cosmopolitanism that makes it such a cool place to live.British people are, at heart, compassionate and kind. AndBegum had shown genuine remorse, repentance or humility I am certain the voices crying out for her forgiveness and safewould have been heard.There are still people arguing for her to be given another chance here, saying she was very young when she fled the UK and that she must have been groomed.But she didn’t go to Syria to work for a charity or help on humanitarian grounds. She went for the specic reason of becoming an IS bride, and supporting terror.It is ironic that the person who stripped Shamima Begum of her citizenship is, like her, the child of immigrants.Whatever the legal ramications of her citizenship, for the Muslim community the damage has been done — and sadly THAT can’t be as easily revoked as her passport.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Or about the Tories, under their most left-wing leader in a generation, in fact being ruled by compassionless brutes.It’s window dressing aimed at disguising their sole obsession, a catastrophically isive second Brexit referendum.Perhaps they need to justy it to themselves. Because Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen backed the  referendum, vowed to respect the result, voted for Article , then stood for election promising Brexit in full: no single market, no customs union.They now consider it “extreme” to keep those promises instead of breaking them. Ex-colleagues honouring the referendum and manesto are “anti-EU zealots”.Wollaston and Soubry represent Leave constituencies. Wollaston even campaigned for Leave initially. How can these hypocrites deny their duped ­constituents immediate by-elections and a “final say” on their duplicity At least, though, we now know the new Independent Group’s only policy: to reverse Brexit. The Labour MPs mainly quit Corbyn’s party over its vile anti-Semitism and economic insanity. The Tories’ recruitment shts the entire focus.Their anti-Brexit arguments, though, are the same old Remoaner claptrap.Soubry even trotted out the feeblest of all, counting non-voters to claim  per cent of us did not back Brexit: A child’s logic, applying to every election ever.Allen claimed they heard the “clarion call for change” from .million Leave voters. They intend to ignore them.They said “compassionate Conservatism” had been sidelined, airbrushing out their own role as serial rebels helping to paralyse Theresa May’s Government.But now they hope she will dump the DUP and make a pact with them in exchange for their “people’s vote”. She could,she wished to destroy her party.The Tories rightly aim to be a “broad church”. But these three shameless defectors, puffed up on sanctimony and epic self-regard, were irreconcilable.They have betrayed their party and their voters. And they’re not done yet.NEXT week backbench MPs could snatch power from the Government over Brexit in one of the most recklessly insane acts ­Parliament has seen.A Labour-backed vote, joined by Tory Remainers, would “take No Deal off the table” and effectively end the PM’s negotiations. The fact this is the brainchild of Oliver “Poll Tax” Letwin should tell you what chaos it will unleash.Which is doubtless why the EU is going cold on compromising. Why should it,Remainers will postpone Brexit Tory Leave MPs must not assume this will fail. Brexit is in mortal danger.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Your mind is bought and sold by their computer programs — with no human intervention required.You are the digital content they auction off for sale to the highest bidder. Billions of pounds pass before your eyes every day. But you don’t see a penny of it.It’s unfair. Never has so much been taken from so many by so few.So it is time to have a big redistribution of digital wealth.Google shareholders and Facebook boss Mark ­Zuckerberg are now worth .TRILLION. How much are you worth Remember, your mind is  per cent of the revenue of these corporations. So it is only right to demand your share.The British people, who set the world an example in waging a revolutionary war against feudal slavery, now find themselves in the latest stage of wage-slavery, working for the benefit of these wealthy companies and ­billionaires.The richest and strongest profit and grab most, while the weakest are utterly robbed, tormented, crushed and strangled.The tech multi-billionaires are, perhaps, some of the richest of all, and geographically the most secure.They have profited more than all the rest from their unholy alliance with weak national governments, who say their own parliaments and laws are too small to control or regulate these giant global corporations.Call it what it is — collusion, crony capitalism. The big companies and big government are hand in hand.The House of Commons’ Digital Select Committee this week called the tech giants “digital gangsters”.But even a good Saatchi alumnus like Damian Collins — the committee’s distinguished chairman — concedes the politicians have no power over these companies.Instead, it’s time for the people — the customers who keep the tech companies afloat — to take a stand.It is unfair that these few companies are so rich, and the many people are so poor.So, I say: Let us march! We are  per cent on the side of the heroes. They are  per cent on the side of the villains. Black and white. No compromise.When the tech companies say: “We agree in principle”, it means they will do nothing in practice.They say fair exchange is no robbery. You provide them with all your personal details — your age, gender, every friend, every photo you send, every film you watch, every app you download, every website you visit, every message, every item you buy, everywhere you go and where you are now — and inthey give you the wonders of the internet world.And as your bonus, they only send you “personalised” ads. Soyou want a new shampoo they don’t “serve” you a dishwasher.They are for the haves who hold power. We are for the have-nots.This is not a question of “privacy”. Or “harmful material”. Or “election interference”.This is a question of money.They have too much. We have too little. So we will make what seems highly improbable in fact happen.Every time Google or Facebook sell you to an advertiser, you should get paid for the privilege. Fair shares for all. The technology exists to make this possible. YouTube already pays people for the number of times their uploaded data is viewed.These companies only care about the millions of users they can sell to advertisers.What was your name again  Here is your chance to get your own back. A business model that says I get  per cent and you get  per cent is not going to last.The tech giants should remember what all Prime Ministers and Presidents usually learn too late.We the people have all the power. It’s best not to push us to use it.I say we need a popular uprising. A people’s revolution. Agitate! Create disenchantment! Build discontent!Join me and say: Start spreading the news. I say we want control. Ownership of our own minds.The new tech billionaires once used to dream of changing the world. Now they’ve got the whole world, they don’t want to let it go.They used to say: Set sail for the end of the rainbow.But now they say: Don’t rock the boat.

Will this cost them money  Yes, peanuts.But whatever it costs, it will be less than having the money dragged out of them.A society without ownership is one in which inequality and resentment flourish.Honour, common sense and the interest of the country require that all free British men and women, wherever they be, now fight for control of their own minds.We will feel more responsible for our own lives.And everyone will agree that this makes everything much fairer and that the people have gained more dignity and self-respect.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We should leave the EU and forge a new path in the world.It was put to a referendum and the rest, as they say, is history.For some, though, the result of the ­referendum is not history. It’s something they are desperate to re-run.Calls for an extension, a delay or even a second referendum are persistent — but so too is mydetermination, and the ­determination of this Government, to deliver on the will of the first one.Democracy is not about trying again until you get the result you want.It’s about compromise and accepting that while we might disagree with each other, we should respect each other’s views.That need for compromise is precisely why we continue to negotiate with the EU. The Prime Minister is fighting hard to make sure we leave with a good deal on March .That determination is the reason I believe that the Conservative Party is the only party delivering in the national interest.The Prime Minister has made clear through her actions that whether you voted Leave or Remain, the deal she seeks will look to bring everyone back together.Whether you are someone who can’t wait to see us leave the EU, or whether you wish the result of the referendum had been dferent — we all, each of us, just want the best for the UK.We have a bright future ahead and one in which the UK will continue to grow as a force for good in the world.The pressure isn’t all on Parliament.The EU needs to come to the table in the spirit of compromise too.It would be the most illogical act of senseless harmthe EU refuses to accept that the UK Parliament will not be trapped in a backstop and instead pushes us to leave with No Deal, thereby ­creating the exact problem with the Northern Ireland border they claim they want to avoid.As far as our current ­negotiation is concerned, we are well into extra time.As Leader of the House, I am responsible for passing the legislation necessary for our exit from the EU.We have a lot to do before March  but I remain confident thatwe resolve the backstop, we will be able to pass the Meaningful Vote and crack on with that vital ­legislation.We are so close to the ­finishing line, so my plea to politicians here and in ­Brussels is: Please don’t snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The EU must lt its eyes and look beyond the current frustrations and towards the close friendship we all want in the future.The Labour Party must carry out the wishes of the majority of its own ­voters, who wanted to leave the EU.And my own colleagues on the ­Conservative benches must not make the perfect the enemy of the good.Don’t hold the PM to ­ransom at such a critical point.Instead, we must hold our nerve and push through.  We must hold fast to the reality of the PM’s deal — that it delivers us a clean exit from the EU and all of its ­institutions while at the same time ­offering a close trading and security partnership that addresses the hopes and aspirations of many in our country who voted Remain.So the prize is great — and it’s all of our futures.Let’s come together and, with one final heave, we can get the PM’s deal over the line and begin to look ­forward, not ­backward.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I’m trying.”Harry asked one pupil Is this the best school in Morocco  and as they were taken inside the boarding house he put his hand reassuringly on his heavily pregnant wes back.The students are from remote communities in the mountains whose parents would normally not be able to afford to send their daughters to school after primary education.Harry and Meghan, wearing shades in the bright sunshine, tenderly held hands as they walked to watch a school football match.The village is only nine miles from where two Scandinavian backpackers were butchered by a gang of ISIS sympathisers in December.Mike McHugo, founder of Education for All, said: The visit is a good news for the people of the area after such a tragic and isolated incident.Meghan then had a quick change of outfit into a blouse and high heels and Harry put on a blazer and tie for a ceremony to award Mr McHugh an MBE for gender equality in Morocco.On Monday their itinerary takes them on a visit to the Moroccan Royal Federation of Equestrian Sports, which helps support children with special needs.There they will watch a riding demonstration and attend a horse-grooming session with some of the kids.They will then go to Villa Des Ambassadors, which teaches disadvantaged children how to cook traditional recipes and will meet disabled kids who work in a specially-designed restaurant.Finally they will visit a market run by social entrepreneurs and meet young people.Last night the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were delayed by two hours after their commercial flight was late taking off following the knock-on effects of an earlier delay to their scheduled plane.Meghan and Harry were welcomed to the country by the British ambassador Thomas Reilly and his we Alix.The Duchess kicked off the tour in style, wearing a red bespoke Valentino dress with a pink handbag and gloves and matching high heels by Christian Dior.The Duke of Sussex also looked stylish in a grey suit as he inspected a guard of honour in dazzling white unorms.The royals then walked along a red carpet that led to Casablanca Airports royal suite where they were offered milk and dates.A motorcade of black limousines was on hand to take them to meet the countrys Crown Prince Moulay Hassan, , who welcomed them at the entrance to their villa in the grounds of the royal palace.They will be staying as guests of Moroccos King Mohammed VI.Mr Reilly said: It’s hugely exciting to have their royal highnesses the Duke and Duchess of Sussex here for the the next few days and I’m really excited to showcase the vital roles that girls education and youth employment are playing in shaping modern Morocco.This official visit by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will highlight Morocco’s focus on women’s empowerment, girls education, inclucivity and the encouragement of social entrepreneurship.The pair are making only their third official overseas trip together, following visits to Dublin and a tour of Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacic last year.The royal couple are set to have a busy few days with seven official engagements lined up.Security fears had been sparked for the royal visit after riots erupted in Rabat earlier this week during a march by teachers demanding more pay.Royal protection officers are said to be worried about the situation and have banned the royal couple from walkabouts.The tour comes days after Meghan enjoyed a baby shower in New York with pals including Serena Williams.Meghans trip to the Big Apple was criticised in some quarters after the lavish visit was said to have cost £,.Princess Dianas former private secretary Patrick Jephson described the private visit as pretty unedying.Harrys dad Prince Charles visited Morocco in  and then again in  with the Duchess of Cornwall."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/NINTCHDBPICT000470221917.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"brexit delay not pm fault","story":"The finger is firmly pointed at the Cabinet careerists who are making Government policy on the hoof, seemingly incapable of grasping even the most basic rules of collective responsibility.The traitorous trio in her Cabinet — Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and David Gauke — sunk any chance of progress in Egypt this week with their demand for No Deal to be “taken off the table”.What reason do EU leaders, who already need to be dragged to the negotiating table, have to give the PM any concessions when even her fellow Cabinet members are giving Brussels a wink thatWe are entering a vital fortnight.

The prime minister - who has gained notoriety for her awkward dances down the years - looked out of her depth as she tried to play a shot. In the end, the prime ministers Chief of Staff Gavin Barwell had to step in to show confused May how to form a rest. Italian Prime Minster Giuseppe Conte uploaded a video showing him handing the UK leader a pool cue before taking a shot himself. Then May, looking confused places her hand on the table and takes aim at the balls. With the stick held in one hand, she positions the cue in a haphazard way before making a shot. Sadly, the clip ends before the outcome of her shot is revealed.   Around  European leaders, including May, were welcomed to Sharm el-Sheikh by Egyptian PresidentAbdel Fattah el-Sisi today, who was co-chairing the summit with European Council President Donald Tusk. Leaders such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Italian and British prime ministers, Giuseppe Conte and Theresa May were in attendance. On the agenda are issues of migration, security, the Middle East peace process, and the wars in Yemen, Syria and Libya. However analysts blasted the ceremonial meeting, which has been labelled as a publicity stunt for President el-Sisi.   The Prime Minister met with European Council President Donald Tusk on Sunday for more Brexit talks. Leaders from Arab League and European Union member nations met at Red Sea resort city for the first ever EU-Arab League summit as the region faces turmoil and political challenges. The Prime Minister is making progress on winning Brexit concessions from the European Union, a senior minister said on Sunday. May is making a last-ditch effort to get changes to the orce package before lawmakers try on Wednesday to grab control of Brexit in a vote.  While May insists Brexit will go ahead as planned, some of her senior ministers have openly threatened to side with rebels to stop a potentially disorderly no-deal exit and the opposition Labour Party indicated it could back another referendum. The EU has ruled out reopening the Withdrawal Agreement, though both sides are looking at a possible legal addendum to reassure lawmakers who worry the Irish border backstop could keep Britain trapped in the EUs orbit for years to come.

Britain has one of the highest obesity rates in Europe and, shockingly, we now have a higher proportion of children classed as obese at the age of  than in the United States. This problem is unfairly harming the future le chances of so many of our young people. It’s also a social justice issue - as it’s children from poorer areas who are being affected the most. That’s why, as well as implementing a host of other groundbreaking measures to tackle this epidemic, I have decided to ban adverts for harmful, unhealthy junk food and drink from the entire Transport for London network – starting today. This means that no adverts that promote food or drinks high in fat, sugar or salt will be accepted unless there’s evidence the product would not contribute to childhood obesity. Brands that sell junk food will still be able to advertise. But they will have to promote the healthier alternatives in their range.  Many of the largest advertisers have already committed to continuing to advertise on the Transport for London network. And in recent weeks, it’s been really encouraging to see them already changing their adverts to bring them in line with our new restrictions. This junk food advert ban will play an important role in tackling childhood obesity in the long term, as it’s clear that advertising plays a huge part in the food choices children make. Evidence from Cancer Research UK shows that the more children are exposed to junk food adverts, the more likely they are to eat these foods and become overweight or obese. With nearly  per cent of children aged  and  in London overweight or obese, there’s no doubt we are sitting on a ticking time bomb that,ignored, could do irreparable damage to the health, educational achievements and future opportunities available to millions of children.  That’s why my decision to introduce this junk food advert ban is overwhelmingly supported by Londoners and leading figures in the health and food sectors, such as Professor Dame Sally Davies, the Chief Medical Officer for England, Jamie Oliver and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. Of course there will always be some who argue against bold change like this. But, just like with my plans to tackle air pollution, I know that we are on the right side of history and that other cities and countries will eventually follow our lead.

Little Thomas Evans is the double of Alfie – the -month-old who died after a heartbreaking legal battle by his parents. Thomas is six months old and his dad Tom today reveals how having a new baby has brought a joy he and partner Kate James feared they would never experience again. Tom, , told the Sunday Mirror: “Thomas is Alfie’s double, the resemblance is amazing. “When we see Thomas pull a face he looks like Alfie, we feel that in a way we have them both with us.  “He’s such a happy baby, he does nothing but smile. I had a great connection with Alfie and I feel like I’ve got the same with Thomas. “We’re hanging in there, keeping sane, doing as well as we can. I wouldn’t know where I was without baby Thomas. “I’ve got something to wake up to with him. I have to keep happy for Thomas’s sake. I wouldn’t want to wake upit wasn’t for the baby. “I don’t like to think what it would be like without Thomas. I worryhe wasn’t here, where would I be  “How would I be  What would my mental health be ”   Tom was speaking as he and Kate revealed a pound, fund for Alfie will be spent on helping sick children. The proud dad added: “When Thomas gets older we want him to understand what Alfie went through and he can know good came from it. We’d like to help children around the UK and the world.” The picture of Tom and Thomas is a ray of light after two years of pain and torment. Tom and Kate had fought to keep Alfie on a le support machine in a case which drew global attention. They lost, ultimately, and their son died at Liverpool’s Alder Hey Children’s Hospital from an ultra-rare degenerative brain disease. Kate, , fell pregnant with Thomas as the legal battle – which taxed her and Tom to the limits – was played out. But the couple stayed together through those tough times and are now devoted to Thomas. Tom said: “Kate is a great mum for Thomas. She has moments when she’s upset and she has a cry. That’s what you have to do to release the emotion. Mums have that bond, especially with the first child.” He accused doctors of separating him and Kate in hospital and telling her that the legal battle was wrong. Tom went on: “It was hard. She questionedwe were doing the right thing. I told her what we were doing, what our friends and family were doing, was the right thing for Alfie. But it wasn’t easy. It was hard for her to hear the arguments of the doctors every day. There was a lot of strain, but we stayed together. “We both loved Alfie and both wanted the best for Alfie. “We remained tough. They were telling her I was wrong. She was pregnant and her hormones and emotions were all over the place.”  The arrival of Thomas triggered a wave of emotions for the couple. Tom explained: “I was nervous but felt happy. We had the test done and he didn’t have the same genes as Alfie, we were told he would be okay. “We were happy that Alfie had a brother, it’s just that Alfie wasn’t there with us. “It was hard because the first time we had a beautul boy and we lost him. “Then when we had Thomas there were tears of joy, but it felt dferent because we had lost our first boy. “We were the same parents Alfie had at home, just in a dferent position, more tense. “ We still speak about Alfie, but we don’t speak about the hospital. We talk about how he is going to help save a lot of children in the future.”  Tom tearfully told how he gave Alfie mouth-to-mouth as his le ebbed away in the early hours of April  last year. With tears rolling down his cheeks Tom said: “I think about that moment every day. That moment is forever in my head. “I was giving him mouth-to-mouth, I could hear him breathing, like a sigh. It gave me more encouragement to keep trying. The noises kept coming and coming. But Kate was saying ‘Stop it, you’re just expanding his belly’. I didn’t want to stop. But I knew he was dead. At the very last moment his colour went. “The police and doctors and nurses were looking through the door, standing there. “I said to them ‘Can’t you do anything ’ They pulled his le support out and thought he would die in three to four minutes. But he lived for five days. We put him on our knees and sang to him, cuddled him.   “I said right to the end that their treatment of him was shyinhumane. “I do feel bad for the nurses because they didn’t have the power. All they could do was stand and watch for five days while oxygen and food was withheld. Up until the last I thought we were going to save him. I tried every avenue. “I was just a dad who wanted the best for his son.” Alfie was born in May  and while initially healthy he fell seriously ill at six months old. He was in Alder Hey Hospital for the last  months of his le. Doctors found he had the rare brain condition GABA transaminase deficiency. They said there was nothing more they could do and advised that Alfie should be allowed to slip away. A court agreed – prompting Tom and Kate’s long battle to overturn the decision, in the hope that Alfie could be taken abroad for le-saving treatment. They appealed to UK and European judges and Tom even met Pope Francis, who backed the couple. But ultimately the courts ruled Alfie’s le support could be switched off. Tom said he and Kate still see grief and bereavement counsellors as they strive for the best way forward. And he is determined to stay strong. He added: “We are still understanding how to grieve. “I want to be more happy around Thomas, I don’t want him to see me crying all the time or with a bad face. “He needs a happy environment. I need to understand how to be happy.” Alfies legacy to help other seriously ill kids Alfies dad Tom says a pound, fund raised in his name will now help other seriously ill children. The sum came from an “Alfie’s Army” fundraising page set up during the legal battle to pay for potentially le-saving treatment in Italy or Poland. Hundreds of supporters also joined demonstrations in support of Alfie. The family has applied for charity status and has already provided wheelchairs and sensory equipment for disabled children. Tom said: “When we get something we think ‘Alfie bought it for them, Alfie is helping that person’. We’re happy that his name can live on in other parents’ and children’s minds.” The Alfie’s Army page states: “We don’t want any other family going through what we have... we are hoping to open a foundation to help other families get the help they need.” "},{"url":null,"title":"britains most viewed homes far","story":"NewsBritains most-viewed homes so far this year revealed - and one costs £mRightmove has revealed the top five most-viewed properties on their site in  so farShareCommentsByElaine McCahillAssistant News Editor:,  FEB NewsBritains most-viewed homes in  have been revealed - including this mansion in Surrey \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBritains most-viewed homes so far this year have been revealed - and one costs an impressive pound.m.

Pontins Brean Sands in Somerset hit the headlines last week after  people were left injured by a falling ceiling.Amongst those hurt was gran Wendy Jones who was this weekend moved to intensive care after her condition deterirorated. The same resort previously featured in a Birmingham Live article, when report reporter Stephanie Balloo decided to find out exactly what the family holiday camp is really like. During her trip, she found chewing-gum trodden into the carpet and saw dirty towels and empty crates of booze dumped in the entrance at the Brean Sands holiday park in Somerset.   The choking stench of stale cigarettes filled an apartment and the toilet seat had been left broken with razor-sharp edges. It transpired a major mix up by staff meant she was given the spare key to a familys occupied flat, exposing all their belongings. One horried dad she spoke to revealed images of what he believed to be human faeces smeared on his paid-for bedding. Another told how their child had cut their feet on loose tiles in the swimming pool. Stephanie kept a detailed account of her short stay - here is her diary...  .pm: Popular destination with Midlands families The taxi driver tells me that Pontins Brean Sands is a popular camp with families from the Midlands. .pm - Surrounded by caravan parks Driving through it seems there are plenty of other options for holidaymakers wanting to enjoy Brean Sands beach. The camp is surrounded by a number of caravan parks. I arrive at Pontins Brean Sands in a taxi and give my details to security who hand me a form to fill out. pm - Musty smell in chaotic arcade As I opened the door to what I imagined was a quiet reception desk, I was immediately plunged into chaos. Dozens of arcade machines all ringing simultaneously, children racing around and a musty lingering smell like an old-fashioned pub. One staff member mans the entire reception and I join the queue of around seven families - all waiting to check-in to their rooms as key collection starts from pm. The arcade carpet is stained with filth and blobs of chewing-gum are trodden into the disgusting flooring at reception.  .pm - Friendly staff The young receptionist is polite and friendly enough - calling me babes and handing me a map with the route to my apartment. She also explains how Ill have to put at least pound of electricity into the meter on top of the pound I paid for two nights in a one-bed apartment. There is no Wi apart from in the main building, I discover. I was directed to the fun factory to find out what entertainment the night had in store for me. Surprisingly, it seems quite an extensive list, despite previous complaints from families there is nothing for the kids. Though judging by the weeks schedule, the entertainment is largely the same every night, with a Pontins character kicking off the evening, dferent Blue Coats performing and a disco to finish.  .pm - Cigarette butts and litter Walking through the holiday park to my allocated apartment I realise the reception isnt the only filthy area. Cigarette butts and rubbish is dumped all over the park - especially near the benches outside the main entrance. En route to my accommodation, I passed a neglected skate park, a strangely quiet adventure play area and a Nisa Local. The grassy areas around the play parks - dotted within the accommodation - were littered with discarded cigarettes as well.  .pm - Sick on the steps Im first greeted to my apartment block with the sight of what appears to be someones vomit. I try to dodge this as I haul my suitcase up the steps. But nothing could prepare me for what I was about to experience.  .pm - Horrying scenes at my apartment A full to the brim bin, burnt trodden-in popcorn and two damp towels - one strewn across the filthy corridor floor and another hung up on the rail. There was a empty crate of beer abandoned and a mug full of cigarettes and ash dumped on the floor outside too. And this was just the exterior of my allocated apartment. I was horried but despite everything Ive heard about Pontins, I thought surely this cant be right. But from the window I thought someone had genuinely left my room in this state, so I double checked the door - number . And double checked my documents - number .  .pm - Spare key to somebodys apartment To my surprise the key worked, but as I tried to enter, a rubbish bag full of half-eaten food and cans erupted and spilled out - blocking the entrance. A blast of stale cigarette smoke hit me and I begged internally to escape this hell. Inside, soiled underwear appeared stuck to the floor, sausages in thick grease on the oven and a bowl of what I can only describe as green slime. I spotted a mobile phone and pairs of shoes and realised Pontins staff had made a very worrying mistake.  .pm - Displeased neighbour The guest next door tells me the people in number  have been staying there for days and have just popped out for the day. It begs the question, why was the apartment all set for me to check-in  Nevertheless, the neighbour doesn’t seem surprised and tells me lots of families have had problems. They’ve lost the plot running this place, she says, as she explains how her room had no running water and a broken TV. She adds that her fire alarm keeps going off too. pm - Room mix-up not uncommon When complaining to reception about my apartment, the formerly chirpy lady now seems inconvenienced and replies agh okay before calling the manager. She explains that there is two sets of keys and suggests the family should have checked out. What may have happened was they were meant to have booked out but obviously the system hasnt updated that theyve booked an extra night or something like that. It doesnt happen too often. Its just that crossover - it has happened before though. She is unapologetic for the inconvenience caused, as is the manager - who says somebody had gone into a room they shouldnt have been in. He claims he was off to find out who they were and sort the situation. .pm - New apartment damp and reeks of smoke I get my keys to the new apartment, no , and it is relatively clean save for the broken toilet seat with the sharp edges. The harsh smell of smoke makes me choke slightly as I enter and theres dripping damp all over the ceiling too. A bucket has been placed underneath to collect the condensation. Small yellow blobs stick to the inside of the bath, though Im unsure what these are.  .pm - Faulty smoke alarms sounding The smoke alarm has randomly started ringing and refuses to stop even though there is no smoke present. Theres no way to turn it off and fteen minutes later it is still sounding. I think it is time to get out of the room. But as I leave, I realise it is the whole block and guests are furious. They say it has been going off constantly all week in the entire block every time anyone tries to cook for their children. They claim Pontins staff have not done anything to resolve the situation. .pm - Furious guest says never again Reacting to the fire alarm issue, a guest staying in my block says its the first time Ive ever been here and the last time too. Another guest says there was no water to bath his children and he entered the apartment to find other peoples food still in the fridge. pm - Hidden costs Dozens of families have flocked to the fun factory as the evening entertainment kick starts with a paparazzi session with Chuckles the monkey. The bluecoats are admittedly very enthusiastic and seem to excite the children. There are huge queues of families waiting to see the favourable monkey mascot, but these extras for the kids all cost more money. It costs pound for the children to have a photo with the monkey while outdated cheesy s music plays in the background. .pm - Litter-plagued leisure area There is litter everywhere and young kids are running around without a parent nearby. Towards the rear there’s an inflatable zone consisting of just two pieces of equipment, but the kids seem to be enjoying it. In the leisure zone there seems to be plenty to do, with go karting, paddle karts, a play area with swings, an urban gym, a skate park, trampolining and the pool. However, all of which is outdated and will cost more money in the form of tokens purchased from the leisure centre.  pm - Pleasant beach nearby Brean Sands is just a three minute walk and is perhaps one of the few selling points for the camp. The long stretch of beach is soft and clean, perfect for young children staying in the nearby Pontins.  .pm - Buffet on dirty plates The evening meal at the Queen Victoria pub for those who opt for self-catering is pound. and consists of some salad, grated cheese, vegetable pie, cod fish cake and chips. Theres also some sliced potato with mince-meat underneath. Some of the plates have spots of food from previous meals clinging on and the food smells are a bit overwhelming. Theres food squashed into carpet and on the floor and the dessert fridges are a mess. I force a little bit of food down but it is largely tasteless just like the squash which misleadingly brands itself as % juice.  .pm - Dirty fridges Dirty fridges full of bashed up bits of cake is the offer for dessert. Crumbs of pudding spill out from the fridges and onto the floor - ready to get squashed like everything  on the food hall floor. Though admittedly what was left of the pudding was surprisingly tasty.  pm - Bluecoat entertainers The fun factory is packed out with hundreds of parents, young babies, toddlers and even teenagers. The blue coat entertainers are up on stage and encouraging the kids and parents alike to be silly - including dancing around like ious animals and being soaked with a water gun. Chuckles the monkey comes out on stage and pantomime style jokes are made, leaving the children in fits of giggles. Everyone seems to be having a great time - especially the children.  .pm - Staff selling toys During the performance, Pontins staff try to squeeze more money out of the guests by offering light up batons to the kids for a set price. There is also a shop at the front selling Pontins branded toys and another store at the side of the main hall. pm - Non-stop evening entertainment The entertainment is non-stop and as soon as party time with Chuckles ends, the children are up on their feet once more dancing to classic school disco songs. The jam-packed line up is great to see and clearly has most people enjoying themselves. .pm - Scantily-clad dancers as children watch With the children still present, the parents continue to drink and the adult entertainment begins. Female dancers in crop tops dance around the stage and sing loud rock songs in the I wanna rock show. As the concert gets underway, the Blue Coats dance seductively as rows of children sit looking up at them.  .pm - Bouncers on patrol There are four bouncers currently manning the bar area and entrance for the fun factory. .pm - Young children play while parents drink Children as young as around six play in the parks outside the apartment blocks with no parental supervision in the pitch black as adults continue to drink inside the main hall. .pm - Chaos as fire alarm clears hall Families cling onto each other and ask whether they have all their belongings as they are evacuated from the building. All the while the children are screaming about their abandoned slush puppies and toys. Everyone is told to move away from the building after what seemed like a serious fire. However, it is believed a drunken guest had smashed the fire alarm.  pm - Doors banging, kids screaming As I try to sleep, the bass from the main hall can be heard among children screaming and doors slamming shut. Ive brought my own sleeping bag after hearing horror stories of blood-stained mattresses and filthy linen. Every breath I take I am inhaling more and more of the lingering second-hand smoke which clings to the walls, furniture and very atmosphere of the musty apartment. am - Parents squabbling with children I was awoken to the sound of what I thought was a fight kicking off outside my apartment. As I looked out into the corridor, parents were arguing loudly with their children in the doorway to their room. The row lasted around an hour before they eventually ed to their rooms. .am - Screaming girl The sleepless night in hell continues as Im woken by the short sharp scream of a young girl. It seems to have come from near the squabbling, restless family - who to my annoyance refuse to sleep. .am - Average breakfast The Queen Victoria is fairly quiet and there seems to be no staff in sight. It is a buffet again, which is all the camp offers in terms of cooked food. Segments of oranges, a fruit cocktail, toast, cereal or the main fry up in silver trays are the options available. But the sausages are spotted with transparent blobs of fat which are chewy to eat. Nothing tastes fresh, and it is fairly average.  .am - Huge queues for swimming pool Around  families are queuing for the swimming pool and have been for more than an hour with their children in just swimwear and a towel. One frustrated child - who clearly doesnt understand time yet - says why are they not open yet, its stupid. The families are forced to wait a total of an hour and a half to be let into the swimming pool for their turn. The long wait was due to no leguards being present at the pool. .am - Rammed pool The pool is rammed full of parents and children - each with around two square metres to swim and play and yet more are piling in. It has a capacity of  people, which is far too many for the size of the pool, in my opinion. The much-anticipated Flume feature of the pool is out of action due to a technical fault.  .am - Child cuts foot on broken pool tile A young child is hopping around in her swimming costume and towel with toilet paper wrapped round a bloody foot. Her father claims she had cut her foot on a broken, loose tile at the bottom of the pool. In images it appears many of the tiles on the bottom of the pool are either dirty or missing.  .am - Faeces smothered on duvet I speak to another unhappy guest who is disgusted by his experience at Pontins. He shows me images of what he claims are human faeces on a duvet supplied by Pontins for a sum of pound. Their mattress, he reports, also had smears of poo all over it. The family, who have come from Cardf, claim they waited from pm until pm at night for clean bed linen for their children to finally go to sleep in. He says . per cent of people are unhappy here and have complained too.  pm - Claims of mice and second pool injury Another family, living at the other side of the park in the chalets, claim mice have chewed through the furniture in their room. While a third family say their child lted one of the loose tiles above his head in the swimming pool after cutting his foot on it. pm - Haven is the Ritz compared to this A pair of unhappy mums - who brought their kids down together - explain how they had bought bleach to clean their chalet themselves. We got bleach flash, wipes, everything to clean as the smell was like rot, damp, festering bodies. We had a conversation last night saying overall theres plenty for the children to do, entertainments fine, but the smell of cigarettes was disgusting. Weve stayed in a lot of holiday parks, Butlins, Haven and this is the worst. Haven is like the Ritz compared to this. pm - Same activities, dferent day On the surface, there seems to be plenty of activities for the children and the whole family in the day time including Curling, Cine Racing, a Disco Bingo and photo opportunities with Pontins characters. However, when dissected this is nearly exactly the same as yesterdays daytime entertainment. And most of which needs to be paid for on-top of the accommodation price. When speaking with families at the end of my stay, many say there is not much to do for the kids in the day - and every day is the same.

The Duchess of Cambridge treated her kids to a day at a luxury spa, where they had swimming races and went for a sauna and steam. Despite their best efforts to fit in with the other guests at the Norfolk hotel, people were quick to spot the royal trio. An onlooker claims Kate looked glamorous in a maroon swimsuit and a full face of make-up. She wore her long brown hair up with a hairclip. Kate, George and Charlotte were reportedly at the pool for about half an hour, and the kids also practiced their ing skills during their trip.   But there was a tearful moment when George went under the water and Kate had to grab him, but it wasnt long before he was off enjoying himself again. One of the other guests told Mail Online: The children were very well behaved and both were practising their ing from the side. Kate was organising little races for them and they did it around four or five times. She said ready, steady go and did a downward chopping action in the water to indicate the start of the race. The onlooker claims that George won all the races.   They said: Charlotte was doing sitting es. She was squatting on the side with her arms up in e position, she kept saying Look mummy I’m ing in.Kate was very encouraging. At one point George went under and Kate had to grab him, he became a bit tearful and clung to her but then he soon went off again.Many royal fans believed the Cambridges would go skiing for the half term break, but the swimming trip suggests they are spending time at their Anmer Hall home instead. The trip also confirms rumours that Kate missed sister-in-laws New York baby shower to spend time with the kids.

He said: No-one  has diabetes in my family, or any history of it, so it was a bit left-side. I think it was sitting down all day and not exercising that probably caused that. I didnt have any time and I was fed up with the long hours. Id spend the weekends just trying to recover and sleeping. When I was put at risk of redundancy, I realised my job was no safer than anyone s. No matter how much you’re earning, as soon as that stops youve got nothing to rely on.

Emma Downs, , who was behind the wheel, claimed she had suffered tiredness and poor eyesight after being prescribed Tramadol and other painkillers for three cracked ribs. She said the drugs made her really tired and said she kept falling over and just wanted to lie down on the sofa.  Just days before the collision, Mrs Downs told friends: I can barely drive, its not safe at night. In a series of texts she said: I was really struggling with my meds and no food.

She lives in Alfreton, Derbyshire, with her husband, Arnold.As my sister Jessie and I walked into the scout hut in , we weren’t sure what to expect. The whole concept of a slimming group was new. With a friend’s wedding approaching, both of us were feeling frumpy and thought it was worth finding out more. We’d already tried to lose weight by ourselves, without much luck. So we joined the room full of people, feeling slightly nervous.  But as I listened to our welcoming consultant Margaret explain her slimming philosophy, I started to think my two shillings and sixpence weekly fee — around p in today’s money — was going to be a good investment. Going to group became a real highlight of my week, with lots of friends laughing together. And we soon started losing weight.  We learnt a lot about food and how to fill up on the ingredients best for weight loss. I lost st, felt full of confidence at the wedding, and took up Margaret’s offer to take over a group. Inspiring people to discover their confidence for  years has given me so much pleasure.Betty is ft in tall and weighs st lb, having lost st at founder Margaret Miles-Bramwell’s original group in   sMy group has been my rock Lynne Asquith, , is also a Slimming World consultant.

My greatest worry on joining was I might have to give up our weekend takeaway, but I didn’t need to. Before I joined, for three weeks, I’d driven to the venue, parked up, then driven home again. Once I finally got inside, experienced the atmosphere and found the plan would fit with our family tradition, I wished I’d gone sooner. It took me six months to lose four stone in , encouraged by my group and mum, Margaret, who was always the first to hear about my weight loss.  I trained to be a consultant myself and, with mum looking out for me, I kept the weight off as I embarked on my new career. In , mum passed away suddenly at .

Then I went through a devastating bout of depression. Trapped at home by my illness, I regained the six stone I’d lost and more. I developed fibromyalgia, a long-term condition causing pain all over my body, and felt at my lowest ebb.  But in , Rob and I decided to start a new business — a vape shop.

Temperatures are  degrees higher than usual for this time of year, the Met Office says, and they could surge to C as Britons bask in the blazing sun and dry conditions. The record-setting, spring-like weather, which has sent Britons to beaches and parks, will last a few more days before temperatures begin to dip and severe Atlantic storms, bringing heavy rain and gale-force winds, herald the arrival of March. Winter isnt over yet - snow is likely at times over high ground in the northwest while the rest of the country is battered by wet and windy conditions from next week.   Monday got off to a chilly and foggy start, continuing a trend seen for the last week, with the Met Office issuing a yellow warning for Cheshire, Gloucestershire and the West Midlands in England, and Denbighshire, Flintshire, Monmouthshire, Powys and Wrexham in Wales. Dense fog was reducing visibility below  metresand disrupting the morning commute. The Highlands in Scotland enjoyed overnight temperatures of C, while things were much chillier further south at -C in parts of Suffolk, Oxfordshire and Worcestershire, tweeted BBC meteorologist Matt Taylor. Once the fog clears later in the morning it will be another sunny and dry day for most places, with temperatures soaring into the high teens.  The sunshine may stay hazy and mist may affect a few coastal areas, the Met Office said. It will feel warm and spring-like for most, but chilly on some coasts a day after temperatures eclipsed C in Wales, the forecaster added. Overnight, clear spells will allow for frost and patchy mist and fog to form again, and it will be breezy and cloudy in the far northwest of Scotland. Tuesday will be a carbon copy of Monday, with another largely sunny day and warm temperatures in the high teens. Britain could see its hottest February temperature ever on one of these days.  The record - .C - was set in Greenwich, southeast London, on February , . Further spells of fog are expected on Wednesday, with mild temperatures lingering, although it will not be as warm. The Met Office said it will become less mild and unsettled from Thursday, with some heavy showers possible. In its long-term forecast, the forecaster is predicting rain and less mild temperatures, with overnight frosts through the early days of March.  Next week, the entire country is likely to see spells of wet and windy weather. The Met Office warned: Strong winds and gales in exposed areas are possible, particularly in the northwest, with snow at times over high ground here. Temperatures shouldnearer to normal, and it will feel quite cold in any windy spells. Britons have enjoyed a rare spell of warm weather, with highs of C recorded on Sunday. The west-coast beauty spot of Gogerddan, in Cardiganshire, Wales, was the hottest place with a record-breaking .C, making it the warmest Welsh day in February since .  The previous Welsh record was .C set in the south Wales village of Velindre  years ago. Hampton Water Works, in the southwest of London, was the hottest spot in England at C, and Londoners took advantage of the chance to head out into the sunshine on the South Bank of the Thames. Down in Dorset, crowds headed to the beach to enjoy the warm weather which is expected to continue on Monday and Tuesday. A spokesman for the Met Office said: Its been unusually mild in many areas of the country and this is the fourth day in a row weve hit C. Monday and Tuesday will be equally as warm,not with a greater chance of C or C.  After that, however, temperatures should be back to normal. Monday and Tuesday will be the last of the very mild days with temperatures coming back to average levels after that, the spokesman added. The temperature might have been affected by a phenomenon known as the Foehn Effect, a dry and warm down-slope wind that occurs to the lee of hills or mountains. Last week, Scotlands -year-old record for the hottest February day was smashed as Aboyne hit .C, beating the previous high of .C in Aberdeen on February , .

Many areas may see some showery rain, but the northwest of the UK is most likely to see wetter, windier conditions. Becoming less mild than recently, with overnight frosts still possible.  There are weaker signals however for drier, more settled weather to continue. By early next week the change to more unsettled weather becomes increasingly likely across the whole country.

The wettest, windiest weather remains most likely in the west, with the best of any drier, brighter weather in the south, extending to central areas at times.

The woman is said to have been stuck in the burning home in Bristol on Saturday when she made the bold decision to jump. Witnesses claimed she leaped from a second floor window onto a trampoline in the garden beneath. Neighbours said they believed she would have died had she stayed in the home, where she was reportedly screaming get me out, get me out. One said she witnessed her make the leap onto her trampoline in the front garden.  Kirsty Dukes told The Sun she was about to put her daughter to bed when she heard a bang that sounded like a car crash.I was at the kitchen window and saw the kids climbing frame installed in front of their house fly into the road. I could hear the upstairs neighbours screaming Get me out, get me out, she said. She said she could see her neighbour, a woman, stuck at the top of the home, while Ms Dukes partner pulled a man who was literally on fire out of the building. We got him to roll across the grass and put him out with water. She claimed to have witnessed the woman stuck on the top storey as she jumped out onto a trampoline in the front garden, adding: I honestly thought someone was going to die.The explosion caused homes several minutes walk away from the property in the Hartclfe area of Bristol to shake after the blast, the Bristol Post reported.Firefighters are still investigating the cause of the explosion, however eyewitnesses believe it could have been started by a gas boiler. The explosion at about .pm on Saturday night destroyed the house in the southern Bristol suburb.  Steve Imrie, Avon Fire and Rescue Area Manager, said: “We committed two crew in breathing apparatus to contain and inspect the fire, while other firefighters began to administer first aid to a number of persons at the scene. All casualties were conscious and breathing. Certainly the initial person who was treated has suffered minor burns.  He added that the cause of the incident remained unknown and is subject to an investigation.: Early information is that there was potential gas at the property, though this is yet to be confirmed.” Fire crew members had managed to extinguish the blaze, and worked to administer first aid to a number of casualties at the scene, prior to the arrival of ambulance crews and police officers.  Eyewitness Taylor Pearson, whose aunt lives next door to the home, said she was safe. Luckily she is in hospital so wasn’t in at the time.

Today,  years on from gunning down principal Burton Wragg, , caretaker Mike Suchar, , and wounding nine others, Spencer is on the cusp of freedom.  In August she becomes eligible to go before a parole board, a day she has been preparing for inside her cell at the Calornia Institution for Women in Corona. But while she may feel she has served her punishment, the victims and their families still dread her release. And that first shooting has cast a dark shadow over America. By her own admission, Spencer feels her actions were the blueprint for the massacres at Columbine, Sandy Hook and Parkland’s Stoneman Douglas High. Back in January , , at .am Spencer, then a geeky looking ginger-haired -year-old, took out the . rle her father had bought her as a Christmas present and pointed it through her bedroom window. Outside pupils were lining up outside Grover Cleveland Elementary School across from her home in San Diego. She trained her sights on the playground and squeezed the trigger, firing off  bullets. There then followed a six-hour stand-off, during which a reporter from the San Diego Evening Tribune, Gus Stevens, began calling houses in the neighbourhood trying to get information. One was that of the Spencer residence and the teenager picked up the phone. When he asked her reason for the school massacre, she replied: “I don’t like Mondays. This livens up the day.”   After surrendering to police on the promise of a Burger King meal, as she walked out in shackles she told them: “It was a lot of fun seeing children shot. They looked like a herd of cows standing around. It was really easy pickings.” She pleaded guilty to two counts of murder and assault with a deadly weapon. On April , , a day after her th birthday, she was sentenced to  years to le.   It is only since the parole process started in , she has expressed remorse. Diagnosed with epilepsy and a depressive, she said she was drinking alcohol and on the mind-altering drug phencyclidine which made her hallucinate when she opened fire. Controversially, she also alleged her father had sexually abused her. “I had to share my dad’s bed til I was  years old,” she said during a  hearing. Her father denied her claims.  She previously told the board: “I know saying sorry doesn’t make it all right. With every school shooting, I feel I’m partially responsible. Whatthey got the idea from what I did ” And yet the model prisoner maintains she is no murderer, refusing to take full responsibility, instead blaming her upbringing. “I had asked for a radio, but got a gun instead,” she said.   Estimates suggest since Spencer’s killings more than , pupils across  schools have witnessed a gun attack in America. It is one of the reasons her bid for freedom is so bitterly opposed by many, including Mr Wragg’s family. His granddaughter Haley, , says: “I know there was a lot of turmoil in the family every time Brenda was up for parole. “I was so young I didn’t really understand it. I felt really scared – like she’d come after me. I felt like letting this person out of her cage would harm my family even more.”   Christy Buell, who with her friend Cam Miller took several of Spencer’s bullets, also objects to her release. She was pretending to ice-skate on the frosty grass waiting for the school bell when the killer targeted her. Shot in the abdomen and buttocks, she spent  days in the hospital and needed two operations.   Christy told the Mirror. “It’s something that has never left. I will always oppose Spencer’s release.” Victim Mary Rintoul is a lone voice in defending Spencer. After  years working in psychiatry, she points to the alleged abuse the killer suffered at the hands of her father and a dysal upbringing.  She says: “Reading the reports and examining what was done to her, I don’t condone what she did, but I kind of understand why she might have chosen that path.” Mary says every time there is a school massacre painful memories flood back. “The first big school shooting after mine was Columbine, I cried for a week. I knew what those kids were going through,” she adds.   Her husband Neil only discovered her part in the shooting on one of their first dates in . As they ed from a restaurant, lead singer Bob Geldof’s I Don’t Like Mondays started playing on the radio. “This is the Boomtown Rats,” he told her as he sang along. “I know,” Mary replied. “The song is about me.” A record level of outrages on US campuses Since Brenda Spencer’s attack, at least  children, teachers and other people have been killed, and another  injured in assaults. And the problem is getting worse. The most bloodshed in American schools was recorded last year with  people killed,  of whom were students, and  injured. Although the US government does not track the attacks, research shows there were  incidents resulting in death or injury. Another database recording school shootings says  had the highest number of incidents recorded.  That database, from the US Center for Homeland Defense, uses a dferent way of identying gun incidents in schools and says there were .

School teacher Cindy Biddle underwent major surgery to remove the skin cancer which was lodged inside her nose. Although the surgeons were able to remove the danger, they had to remove part of the -year-olds nostril and rebuild it using skin from her forehead. The reconstruction left her with huge swelling disfiguring her face while it healed, but Cindy. from Florida, said she refused to let people stare. My scars were pretty jarring, but there’s no way I was going to hide away. “If I caught anyone giving me an unwarranted stare, I told it to them straight, she said.   One time, I turned around on a group of guys walking behind me and they jumped back with a look of disgust. It reduced me to tears, and when I saw them again the day after, they were all laughing. “This time, I kept my cool and told them: ‘Don’t act like jerks. It’s obvious I’ve had surgery.’ “They turned tail and ran.” Today the teachers scars are almost totally healed, but she - and doctors - almost missed the cancer entirely.   The only visible sign of the tumour growing inside her face was a tiny sore, which looked just like a spot that would not heal. Cindy tried picking at it and moisturising, and was even prescribed an antibiotic cream by her doctor, but it would not get better. It was only identied as basal cell carcinoma - a skin cancer is mostly caused by too much exposure to the ultraviolet rays from the sun - by accident.The history teacher had gone to a walk-in clinic because she had a bad migraine , when the new doctor spotted the spot on her nose and immediately referred to a specialist. Cindy said she had no idea spending too much time outdoors could have given her cancer. I’d been working as a bar tender at a local Mexican place and had spent a fair amount of time in the sun and on the beach. “Growing up, no one gave a second thought to sun protection and I spent a lot of my childhood outside in the sunshine. “I was told the cancer had probably been growing for decades, possibly since I was  years old.” When she did go under the kne to remove the tumour, her husband Jonathan had to leave the room he was so shocked by the size of the growth.   Doctors then stretched her cheek skin to cover the hole and built her a new left nostril with skin from her forehead. Despite her shocking new appearance, Cindy said there was no alternative. This was something I had to do, because otherwise the cancer was literally going to eat my face off. I could have lost an eye or my entire nose.” She charted her recovery from the surgery with photos as the swelling gradually went down and her face ed to normal. Today, she is focusing on spreading the word about the danger of skin cancer and importance of protecting skin. I’ve only been to the beach once since my op and I was very nervous, sitting under an umbrella the whole time. “I wear factor  sunscreen every day now - evenit’s pouring with rain - and I always wear a hat outside. “A lot of my friends have stopped lying around on tanning beds. I have to say - take a look at the pictures. They would certainly stop me.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ghost hunter claims worlds best","story":"NewsGhost hunter claims he has worlds best evidence of le after deathMark Davies says his next step will be to comfort the spirits and let them know they won’t be judgedShareCommentsByChris Matthews:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video mark-davies-falmouth-ghost-hunting-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A ghost hunter from Cornwall is convinced that he has the proof of le after death in a video showing figures emerging from a grave. Mark Davies, , has challenged any expert to prove his video doesnt show spirits emerging from a grave containing the bodies of two women at Falmouth Cemetery. He told Cornwall Live he has probably the best evidence in the world right now of authentic paranormal activity, in the footage filmed last week.“I’ve been doing this for two years now and have never seen anything like it.” Mark has edited the video down to a  minute clip and is hoping that it will force senior paranormal investigators to take notice. Mark has already appeared in local news after he spoke out about his encounter with a mysterious creature which he described as an alien or a demon.He said: “It’s crazy. There’s a number of things happening and I’ve edited it to bring into focus the heads on the grave. “To the left of the grave there are also figures coming out and you can see an orb figure that moves. A solid object clearly walks for two seconds then vanishes in a sort of white mist.  “I invite any expert to dispel this evidence as it is the pinnacle of proof for le after death. You can see the faces coming out of the grave and something happening. A ball of cotton or something floats above the graves, it’s mental. Mark says that now the weather is improving he intends to go out and investigate Cornwall’s paranormal activity more frequently. He added: “This is proof of le after death and I’m hoping to get it on the national news so someone important in the paranormal field will notice it. Visually it’s as clear as day and the most concrete evidence you can get. I just wanted visual proof to show people and I’ve got it now.”  Mark says that he pays no attention to doubters and just wants to concentrate on his work. He says his next step is to investigate why the spirits appear to be stuck in the graveyard. He said: “I will use transcommunication special radio to help them across. The spirits need to be comforted and know that they won’t be judged. They just need to forgive themselves and go home.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle morocco tour live","story":"NewsMeghan Markle Morocco tour LIVE: Duchess and Harry taste recipes in cooking demoThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex are watching underprivileged children cook and will later meet social entrepreneurs who will tell them about youth empowerment on the final day of their visitShareByRussell MyersDanya BazaraaNews ReporterUpdated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video harry-meghan-visit-royal-moroccan-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, combinedPrompt :true, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\" data-chronos-request-url\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx v live-centre nationals-live \" data-embedded-url-endpoint\"https:www.mirror news world-news meghan-markle-morocco-tour-live- serviceresponsiveembeddedArticleUrl\" data-chronos-domain\"https:livecentreps-eb-prod.tm-awx \" data-inview\"true\" Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are in Rabat for the final day of their tour in Morocco.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have learned how the countrys love of horses is being used to help children with disabilities at an equestrian club today.

It has been almost two years since ruler King Mohammed VIs we Princess Lalla Salma was last seen in public. The pair, who met at a party in  and married several years later, are widely rumoured to have orced - but this has never been confirmed by the Palace or members of the royal family. The disappearance of the -year-old princess from public le is said to have become an elephant in the room with Moroccan media reportedly choosing not to make mention of it.  But when Meghan, , and Harry, , meet King Mohammed, , tomorrow, British officials said they had no ideathe VIP visitors would ask after her in spite of their mission to promote gender equality. The focus of the the Duke and Duchesss four-day trip is also the changing social attitudes towards women in the country. Meghan and Harry have already met the couples son Crown Prince Moulay Hassan, , dubbed one of the “richest teenagers in the world”. He shook hands with the pair at the entrance to their royal villa in the grounds of King Mohammeds palace after they stepped off the plane at Casablanca airport onto a red carpet last night. They are staying as “honoured guests of the King” at one of the opulent royal palacesuntil Tuesday. It was believed to be the first official meeting between the British royal family and the future monarch of Morocco.   The King and Princess Lalla Salma also have an -year-old daughter, Princess Lalla Khadija. Princess Lalla Salmas whereabouts have been the subject of much speculation with rumours shes living in exile in the United States. There has also been a suggestion she is in the Greek Island of Kea with her daughter. Netty Leistra, a royal journalist, told Royal Central : “I think Salma had a very hard job trying to be the first visible we of a Moroccan king.There is quite an age gap too. Salma did some good things and of course, gave birth to two children. I always thought she did rather well. I guess thatthe news is correct about the orce, they will give her a nice big house and all the money she needs so that she won’t say anything about it. But I think it is rather sadit is true.” Like Meghan and Harry, the princess is a prominent supporter of womens rights. She also attended Kate Middleton and Prince Williams wedding in .  The Duke and Duchesss visit is focusing on womens empowerment, social entrepreneurship and girls education. Today the couple visited a school boarding house run by Education For All, an organisation for girls aged between  and  from some of the poorest and most remote areas of the country. The Duke and Duchess dropped into a classroom and spoke to some of the girls studying for exams, for whom without the school they would not have the chance to reach their full potential. It is a project transforming attitudes to female education in the Moroccan mountains and something the Duchess of Sussex wanted to visit. A heavily-pregnant Meghan also took part in a Henna ceremony, in which -year-old student Samira decorated the Duchesss hand with a henna flower to celebrate her pregnancy. The henna is tradition in Morocco and a blessing during the seventh month of pregnancy to celebrate the health of mother and baby. This evening, Harry and Meghan were greeted to Rabat residence of British Ambassador Thomas Reilly.  Upon entering the home the Duke and Duchess were given a traditional rosewater greeting and were officially welcomed by the ambassador’s we Leah. Meghan dazzled in a Moroccan inspired kaftan style Dior gown, with Dior clutch bag. At the glittering reception the royal couple mingled with guests from across Moroccan society including young leaders, entrepreneurs, business representatives and influential people from local girls’ education and sport. Meghan discussed the boundaries women face and issued a clarion call to feminists around the world. She said: “Women have to challenge everywhere in the world.” The event was held to highlight the positive dference the guests have made to Moroccan society through their influence and activities. A spokesperson for The Duke and Duchess previously said: Their Royal Highnesses are very much looking forward to the visit and are grateful to their hosts and the British Embassy for arranging such an interesting programme. They are particularly pleased that they will have the opportunity to meet so many young Moroccans over the next few days.

across dundee and tayside have chance to design their own oor wullie sculpture","story":"Children and communities across Dundee are being given the chance to design their own mini Oor Wullie sculptures.Schools and community groups gathered at DC Thomson’s headquarters to mark the launch of this summer’s Big Bucket Trail.Brightly decorated figurines of the iconic comic character will hit the streets of five Scottish cities from July until September.As part of the nationwide public art project, youngsters are invited to put their own spin on the wee scamp.At the launch, The Archie Foundation charity gave a presentation to teachers and community group leaders about how their involvement with the trail will benefit sick children in Dundee.Annie Loughrin, creative, learning and special project manager at Wild in Art, said: “There are absolutely no limits to the designs and that’s the really exciting thing about this project.“The brilliant thing about creativity is that young people can let their imaginations soar.“They won’t necessarily see this sculpture as a cheeky wee scamp – they might turn it into a backdrop for other things.”Once the statues are designed and painted, they will become part of a smaller trail which will run at the same time.Vikki Taylor, a teacher at St Mary’s Primary in Lochee, said: “We did the Maggie’s penguin parade with our kids.“Our school is in the heart of Lochee so they children have been looking at Lochee in the past, present and what it might look like in the future so they might incorporate that into their design ideas.“I like how the kids can take control of the project and it allows them to be creative because there’s so much pressure on literacy, numeracy and health and wellbeing.”Craigiebarns Primary teacher Adele McGrath said: “I think it’s just about bringing the whole school together with kids who maybe wouldn’t be so forthcoming before at giving their creative ideas.”Sarah Johnston, Tayside fundraising manager for The Archie Foundation, added: “The mini Oor Wullie sculptures give schools and community groups a great opportunity to engage children in a range of cross-curricular activities as well as encouraging communities to come together and support the Big Bucket Trail and the work of The Archie Foundation.“The idea is to give young people the tools to be excited about the Bucket Trail.“The mini sculptures will be placed in places such as local libraries and once the trail is finished, they will form part of the farewell event.“It’s a chance to be part of something big.”The mini trail is part of the farewell event which will be held just before the full-size statues are auctioned – and the mini Oor Wullies will be ed to their schools or groups to keep.A total of  Oor Wullie sculptures will take to the streets of the City of Discovery, as well as Aberdeen, Inverness, Edinburgh and Glasgow.In Dundee,  sculptures will be on display at ious locations before being auctioned off to raise

appointed Heckingbottom as the successor to Neil Lennon last week and he kicked off his time in Scotland with an Easter Road win over Hamilton Accies.While, in time, the Dee boss knows his opposite

To add to the drama, it’s done as a race against the clock.And McIntyre is gaining a growing reputation for doing the same with top-flight clubs here.Four-and-a-bit years ago he arrived at Ross County with the Highland outfit seemingly already doomed to relegation.By the end of that season he hadn’t just kept the Staggies up, he’d rebuilt them into a squad that would go on and win silverware in the shape of the  League Cup.After the Dark Blues’ weekend win at Livingston got them out of the bottom two for the first time since the end of August, thanks to goals from new handy men Andrew Nelson and Scott Wright, there are strong signs he can do the same at Dens Park.McIntyre’s reign as Dundee boss started in October when he received an SOS from owner Tim Keyes and managing director John Nelms.After a miserable start to the campaign, the Americans’ dream of cementing their team as a force in the Premiership and, eventually, taking the club to a new stadium looked in danger of crumbling around them.Confirmation of just how dire the need for an emergency rebuild came in his first game in charge when the roof fell in during a - defeat at Livi. It showed how flimsy the foundations of the team were as they collapsed under the weight of the home team’s excellence at set-pieces.Almost exactly four months on and after that second visit to the Tony Macaroni Arena under the new boss, the structure looks much more sound.And it’s all thanks to the kind of speedy reconstruction he undertook at County and of which Knowles and his team would be proud. For the team that ran out against Livi at the weekend bore no resemblance to the one McIntyre had to work with when he first headed there.Not one of the players in the starting XI in October were on from the start this time and of the  who were involved on that first day,  have left the club.Only Kenny Miller, Cammy Kerr and Elliott Parish remain and, of those three, veteran Miller was the sole participant in the vital - victory.For McIntyre, to bring about almost a complete change in such a short space of time has been a gamble, one that will only be confirmed as paying offhis team are still in the Premiership come the end of the season.It’s one, though, that represents his best chance of success and it is very much a case of so far so good.While Dundee under him remain a work in progress, the signs of improvement have been there for all to see.Since the end of the winter break there have been two wins, two draws and just one defeat in five league outings.By some margin that’s been the best run of form in the top flight so far this term.If it continues there is every reason to believe that target of building a team good enough for this level by the end of the season will have been achieved.Andthat is the case, fans will be hoping given more time, the manager will be able to set about putting together something even more impressive for next season and beyond."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"hugh-jackman-in-glasgow-how-to-get-tickets-without-using-ticketmaster","story":"AS is usually the norm when big acts announce gigs, music fans have been unable to buy tickets to see Hugh Jackman in Glasgow through Ticketmaster, despite him having announced a staggering three-night run in May."},{"url":null,"title":"calvin-harris-from-bedroom-dj-to-double-brit-winner","story":"CALVIN Harris has undergone quite the transformation, from being a budding DJ recording in his bedroom to becoming a double Brit-winning musician who models on the side."},{"url":null,"title":"taking-your-car-abroad-after-brexit-looks-like-youll-be-needing-a-green-card","story":"THE prospect of a no-deal Brexit, meaning no transition period, will mean insurance lsquogreen cardsrsquo will be required for UK drivers venturing across the Channel or into the Republic of Ireland from March , ."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-and-snp-clash-over-equal-pay-at-council-budget","story":"A ROW over the decade long equal pay dispute broke out at the City Chambers as the SNP got its budget through"},{"url":null,"title":"new-13m-plan-to-fix-more-glasgow-potholes-first-time","story":"MORE potholes will be fixed first time under a new repairs investment plan by Glasgow City Council."},{"url":null,"title":"busted-spt-say-bus-drivers-running-red-lights-could-face-sack-from-employers","story":"Glasgows passenger transport executive has said that dodgy bus drivers who run red lights could face the sack from their employers."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bbc-scotland-channel-set-for-launch","story":"The new BBC Scotland channel is set to be launched, a year after being officially announced by the corporation."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan-and-harry-greeted-in-sunshine-by-flag-waving-moroccan-students","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have arrived in Moroccorsquos high Atlas Mountain region to meet young women getting a secondary education thanks to the efforts of a British entrepreneur."},{"url":null,"title":"wriggle-no-more-uks-worm-population-in-decline","story":"THE UKs worm population is in decline which is also hitting bird numbers, according to the first major study of its type."},{"url":null,"title":"no-brexit-deal-in-time-for-meaningful-vote-this-week-says-theresa-may","story":"Theresa May has admitted she will not get a Brexit deal in time for MPs to hold a ldquomeaningful vote this week, amid warnings time is running out for an agreement before Britain leaves the EU ."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-doctors-get-new-guidelines-for-treatment-of-eating-disorders","story":"Doctors are to be given new guidelines to support the treatment and care of patients with eating disorders."},{"url":null,"title":"south-city-way-council-in-pledge-to-make-glasgow-cycle-route-safer","story":"Council officials have moved to reassure cyclists in Glasgow after concerns were raised about junctions on a developing bicycle route."},{"url":null,"title":"lou-sanders-straight-talking-comedy-in-a-double-treat-for-glasgow-festival-fans","story":"Lou Sanders doesnrsquot shy away from the big topics in her comedy.

We originally only planned to install one but the money kept coming in and we had enough for another one so we spoke to Davy’s Fish Bar and they said they would back it.”The defibrillators can be purchased for around £, – a reduced price because they were bought in bulk through the Butchers at the Heart of the Community scheme.Both defibrillators will be accessibly to the public when needed.If an emergency  call is made and the defibrillator is registered with the Scottish Ambulance Service, the nearest device can be located and a code given to the caller to unlock it.Once opened, instructions are provided.For heart-attack victims, the community defibrillators could prolong their lives by vital minutes, because the more time that passes during a cardiac arrest without assistance, the less chance there is of survival.Mr Milne said he was overwhelmed by the community’s generosity.He said: “Most of it was raised in the shop. We also raised about £ through a Just Giving page.“Local musicians put together a concert at Newhills Church, and a second one at Bucksburn Church which raised quite a bit of money.

The second act features the victim joining the witness, creating a connection that will inevitably be broken, when finally, in the third act, the victim is alone, caught between a choice of the smoke and fire within the collapsing building or the  metre drop to freedom.It was a very poignant performance, tenderly expressing the horror of the incident, perhaps now weakened due to overindulgence. When the lights came up everyone stayed where they were, perhaps a little too stunned to move. Chatter was in whispers, for respect to people who could not hear them.As the narrator of the show captured and pieced together from coverage of the attacks said, the dust has not settled, and never will. The losses of the people in the planes and buildings is still felt, and the wider western world is still wary, still learning, still recovering.Within This Dust manages to depict the horror of that day beautully, and more importantly, delicately. No easy task for a grieving world.PIC:Craignish Village Hall was full. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood amongst the #dust#. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Lisa Hood. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood collecting dust. _aWithinThisDustLisa Hood and Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustDancer, Vince Virr. _aWithinThisDustVince Virr facing the smoke, or the window. _aWithinThisDust"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll rugby fans form scotlands honour guard","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThree Mid Argyll-based girls were among those given the honour of forming the honour guard at Friday February #s Scotland v Italy women#s rugby game.Amber Russell, Drew Buckley and Anya Gritten travelled to Scotstoun stadium on Friday night with their Oban U teammates to form the honour guard for the Scotland women#s team as they took on Italy in the first game of this year’s six nations tournament.The girls formed a tunnel of Saltire flags for the teams to run through as they took to the field.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"inveraray accordion and fiddle club rings in the new year","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club got the New Year off to a great start at the Inveraray Inn on January .Supporting players were Fyne Folk, with Sally Hall, Alex John MacLeod, Jake MacKay on fiddles, Agnes Liddell on keyboard and were joined by Calum Satchel on fiddle.

In fact, on average, Borderers are forking out pound less than their Northumbrian opposite numbers.Since First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the end of the freeze in , Scottish Borders Council has taken full advantage of the ability to raise council tax by % each year, and this year is no dferent, as the council agreed to a three per cent increase in December .However, the deal agreed by the SNP and Scottish Greens allows councils to raise tax by up to . per cent for  .Council leader Shona Haslam, who represents Tweeddale East, has been adamant that Scottish Borders Council will not take advantage of the increased limit, and will not raise an extra . per cent on Borderersrsquo council tax, instead sticking to an increase of three per cent.Council will not introduce workplace parking levy:Scottish Conservatives in the Borders have been very vocal about their opposition to the Scottish Government plans to introduce a workplace parking levy, where employers will be charged an annual tax based on how many parking spaces they provide for their employees.The aim is to persuade more commuters to use public transport in a bid to reduce pollution, but the charge could lead to employers passing the bill onto their employees.Both councillor Haslam and Scottish Borders Councilrsquos SNP opposition leader Stuart Bell, who both represent the rural ward of Tweeddale East, have signalled their opposition to the plans, so it is extremely unlikely this will feature in the councilrsquos budget proposals.Borderers who travel to Edinburgh for work could possibly be affected by the levy though, as Edinburgh City Council is considering implementing the charges.A move to three-weekly bin collections:Rumours have been circulating amongst councillors that Scottish Borders Councilrsquos waste refuse collection service will move to three-weekly bin collections, from the current once-a-fortnight collectionThe local authority is currently reviewing its waste collection service, which is expected to feed into the new budget for  .In fact, at a meeting of the council in October , Selkirkshire councillor Gordon Edgar, the authorityrsquos executive member for roads and infrastructure, refused to rule out the possibility when questioned by Hawick and Denholm councillor David Paterson.,params: .pushThe veteran Hawick councillor said: ldquoIf they go to a three-weekly collection it would cause some very serious problems for many of the people that we represent and I am sure it would increase the incidents of fly tipping.No tourism tax:Another controversial aspect of the SNP Scottish Greens budget proposals is the introduction of a tourism tax on nightly accommodation.Much like the workplace parking levy, local authorities have discretion over whether to implement it or not, and again Scottish Borders Tories have ruled out introducing it here.Changes to grass cutting services:Grass cutting, or the lack of it, has been a constant thorn in the side of the council over the past year.As an issue which caused a large furore, Scottish Borders Council could well announce further changes to the grass cutting regime, particularly around the maintenance of cemeteries.Changing the frequency of grass cutting from a -day cycle to a -day cycle was widely criticised by communities, with residents reporting overgrown public spaces and ankle-high grass in the regionrsquos cemeteries.Many opposition councillors have called for a rethink on the councilrsquos grass cutting policy, and due to the large number of complaints from Borders resident it is expected to be addressed in Thursdayrsquos budget announcement."},{"url":null,"title":"sos-to-keep-youth-club-afloat","story":"AN SOS has been issued in a bid to keep a village youth club open.Walkerburn Youth Club needs adults who have an interest or experience in working with young people to get in touch.The club meets at the Public Hall every Thursday evening from . to pm -

Now, with less regulation in place, there are thousands.’True to the name, Viola FC is a family-run agency # his son Johnny joined its ranks in early  # with their main work both in representing players coming to the UK, and ‘brokering’.John explained: ‘We mostly represent footballers transferring to the UK, while brokering involves working with clubs, players and other agents to help bring those players here.‘That said, we have done a lot of work in countries such as Brazil and China in recent years, where there is a huge appetite for football. You make valuable contacts and get to see some exciting players.’However, for John the image of the football agent thrashing out a lucrative deal for himself as well as for the player, fails to tell the whole story.He explained: ‘Of course working in football can be financially rewarding, but it’s a hard job. People think you’re just walking around in a suit with a laptop and phone, but so much goes into being a player representative.‘You need to travel a lot, and that means lots of airport lounges and hotel rooms.‘You’re working long days and doing lots behind the scenes, and all year round,  because that’s what it takes.‘The public see the excitement of the transfer windows on TV and then think that’s all agents do.‘If an agent does their job properly, they are available day and night, looking after the whole package for the player, like houses and children’s schooling.‘We’re more than a ‘necessary evil’, we do an important service for both the club, and the player.’Thinking about Campbeltown visits again, John brings up a memorable trip to the Wee Toon, where his son Johnnybecame an unofficial pool champ.John said: ‘My uncle John took us to the Commercial Inn to watch a game of football on the TV. Johnny was only young but he ‘won’ a pool competition in the pub.‘Of course, the adults had let him win, but he believed for about ten years he was the pool champion of Campbeltown!‘That’s just one but I have lots of good memories of visiting Campbeltown, and the surrounding areas, such as Machrihanish.#For me Kintyre is a special part of Scotland.’Reflecting on a career in football of more than  years, including representing many Celtic and Rangers players, his hunger as an agent remains.John, whose recent travels include talent-scouting missions to Portugal and Ghana, added: ‘I am blessed to do this job. I have made some great personal connections and am even godfather to some players’ children.I grew up in Easterhouse, and now I get to work with top players and managers, visiting great stadiums. It’s not bad to be able to say that.‘At the same time, I know I have worked hard for those opportunities and I don’t take them for granted.’John Viola with his son Johnny centre and former client, and now colleague, Craig Moore in Ghana."},{"url":null,"title":"letter district news disappoints","story":"I note that for the second week running the Islay section of the Courier#sIs this now Courier policy Are we to have a regular feature on the wonderful works and world of the all-conquering Alastair to sit alongside his weekly SNP bad letter It was said of Alan Reid in his days as MP that he would attend the opening of an envelope Alistair Redman could give him lessons.A Google search for our beloved councillor produces Alastair Redman archives # Campbeltown Courier as the th result, after two for ArgyllThere seems to me to be an uncomfortably close association between our local paper and a local politician.Tony WilliamsGrumpy Old ManMuasdale"},{"url":null,"title":"letter maintain tarberts social housing","story":"The issue that I hear about the most, from ward members in Tarbert, is the need for new social housing and the importance of maintaining and improving the existing housing stock.While the four new houses that are planned are welcome many residents have quite rightly said that many more are needed.Both externally and internally, housing must be improved including repairing and repainting the hallways that link many housing association flats.There have also been calls to rollout external wall insulation across all of the social housing in Tarbert, and while there has been a start on this clearly more needs to be done.As a social housing tenant myself I know all to well the dficulties in getting housing associations to act on concerns raised by tenants.I continue to press for more and better social housing across the Kintyre and Islands ward.Councillor Alastair Redman,Portnahaven,Islay."},{"url":null,"title":"letter support the raf benevolent fund","story":"Last month’s vandalism at the Bomber Command memorial highlighted the very worst and the very best of our communities.I cannot thank your readers enough for their incredible support in the wake of this shocking paint attack.To date we have received more than £, in donations to help the RAF Benevolent Fund meet the repair bill.Repair works have now been completed on the memorial and it is now ed to its former glory.As well as the donations received, the RAF Benevolent Fund had thousands of messages of support from around the world.It was heart-warming to see the regard in which the memorial, the veterans and the , men it stands to represent are held.We must never forget their sacrices and the RAF Benevolent Fund is proud to beof this tribute to their legacy, for generations to come.As the Fund enters its th year of support for the RAF family, we must not forget those veterans who are still with us.Our aim this year is to ask for the public’s help in reaching more of these veterans and their families, while we still can.Our support could help pay for the care costs of an RAF widow, or provide for mobility aids to keep an elderly veteran at home, or simply allow a veteran to enjoy his retirement in dignity and comfort, through a regular financial grant.Put simply, the RAF Benevolent Fund looks after the RAF family.

But spring still feels like a long way off.I crave it, not just because it makes the evening walks in the woods possible once more, but because of the beauty it s to the landscape.The land is still dormant, with nature seemingly sleeping. Itrsquos at this time of year that the ugly results of peoplersquos disregard for the land can be most clearly seen. Litter of all kinds lsquodecoratesrsquo the roadsides. In summer it is partly hidden as hedges, roadside bushes and grasses grow. But in winter nature retreats and exposes the extent of peoplersquos uncaring behaviour.I canrsquot understand it, I really canrsquot. Our country is so beautul, yet so many people just throw rubbish from their car window. Do they not see the results and feel a sense of shame and horror  In a country where we have the facilities to dispose of our rubbish, there is simply no excuse to trash our landscape like this.And in a time when there are cuts to vital services, councils having to pay money to pick up peoplersquos rubbish from the sides of roads is just another unseen effect. Itrsquos not just that itrsquos ugly to look at, itrsquos polluting our environment, killing wildle and leaving an appalling legacy for our children.And so as we set off last Sunday for a walk, the sight of litter strewn everywhere along the roadside was quite depressing. And my children noticed its ugliness too. ldquoWhy do people litter like this  I was asked by my five-year-old Skye, and to be honest I struggled for an answer.ldquoI really donrsquot know, but it must be because they donrsquot care.My daughter seemed forlorn at this reply as we drove past a mass of discarded fast food remains, plastic bottles, beer bottles, plastic bags and yet more fast food rubbish.But I wanted to lt her spirits and so told her we were going on a hunt for something beautul. We were on a snowdrop hunt! And so as we drove to our destination, I reminded them of my version of the old story:lsquoMany years ago, Snow had no colour. It felt ashamed and left out to be colourless, especially when the land was so beautully covered in flowers of all dferent colours.And so Snow asked the flowersthey would be willing to share just a little of their colour. First Snow asked the daffodils, who were a beautul yellow. But they said no, they needed all their colour for themselves.Then Snow asked the bluebells, who were a wonderful blue. But they said they were too small to share any of their colour.Then Snow asked the whin bushesthey could share some of their vivid yellow, and they said no because they needed the colour.Snow even asked the roses of summer, but got the same answer: no.Then Snow heard a small voice and looked down. It was a small white flower. We can share some of our colour, with you it said.ldquoBut you are so small and you need your colour for yourself, said Snow. ldquoYes, the flower replied, ldquowe are small and we need our colour, but there are many of us andeach one of us gives a little then we can give you enough colour.ldquoThat is very kind of you but I donrsquot want to ruin your beautul appearance, said Snow.ldquoDonrsquot worry, said the wee white flower, ldquowe can all take a little colour from the inside of our petals, so it will not be noticed that any white is missing.rsquoAnd so that is how Snow became white. And because of the kindness shown by this little flower, Snow agreed to share its name with it, and so they became known as snowdrops.Snow also shared its space with the wee flower, so snowdrops and snow are often seen on the ground together. Andyou look carefully inside the snowdrop, you will see the hidden part where the white has been scraped off to give to Snow.With the storyrsquos end we arrived at Smeaton Lake, near East Linton, our destination for the snowdrop hunt. Itrsquos such a beautul place where a planted wood stands guard by a lake created  years ago. The woodland here is possibly unsurpassed in East Lothian for the canopy of snowdrops it displays.Excited screams at small patches of the flower soon gave way to ldquowow, look as we reached the end of the waterside and a wood carpeted by the wee flowers.My spirits were lted as I watched my daughter carefully examine flowers for evidence they had shared their colour. She showed her wee brother the green strips inside, explaining that is where the white was shared from. Both were careful not to damage or pick the flowers, despite their desire to do so.ldquoWersquoll find some growing in a less happy place and take those ones home, I assured them.And so we eventually headed back, a delicious bowl of ice cream at The Goth in Prestonpans, accompanied by traditional music, the reward for a good dayrsquos hunting.That night my daughter was reflective. ldquoI wish people wouldnrsquot spoil nature, she said. I felt guilty shersquos only five, I thought to myself, and shouldnrsquot have to be concerned about such things at that age. Perhaps I should have kept my thoughts to myself.ldquoBut I wonrsquot, and Irsquoll tell my friends not to as well. Can you tell me the snowdrop story again  So I told her the story once more.She had one wee snowdrop in a bowl by her bed. We had found it growing precariously at the verge of the road, surrounded by litter, and she wanted to lsquosaversquo it. So we did, hopefully with roots intact.ldquoWell we will plant the snowdrop in the garden and perhaps we will have our own snowdrops next year! I said to her, and she was happy at this.I went downstairs as she slept. My thoughts and emotions flooded me. My anger and depression at the ignorant mess we are making of our planet was superseded by my daughterrsquos determination to make a small dference, just like the snowdrop in the story.And perhaps therein lies the true message of that old tale: a dference can be made,we all do a little, but do it together.The children are the future, but letrsquos not leave all our ugly mess and destruction to our children to deal with. Let us all do something small, as many already are, to change the way we behave and how we appreciate what we have been gted.For our childrenrsquos sake, I really hope itrsquos not too late."},{"url":null,"title":"county-team-conquer-kilimanjaro-in-memory-of-vera-cameron","story":"Dougie Cameron and daughter Laura-Jane were joined by seven other men and women in climbing Mount Kilimanjaro last week.The trek was the latest fundraiser in memory of Vera Cameron and in aid of Cancer Research UK.Laura-Jane said that her mum would have thought the fundraisers were ldquooff our heads but would be ldquoreally proud of their achievement, which takes the fundraising total to about pound,.She said: ldquoIt was a really tough challenge but the fact we were doing it for charity kept us going.ldquoAt the end of the day, it was for such a good cause and we wanted to get to the top and keep the sponsorship going.ldquoThe whole experience was totally dferent to what I expected.ldquoBeing over seven days, we have never done anything like that before and it was tough mentally and physically.ldquoWe had one goal ndash to get to the summit ndash and we ended up making lots of new friends and spent a lot of time with other groups.ldquoIt was a really good experience overall.Vera, of Macmerry, worked for East Lothian Council as a senior administrator in transportation.Dougie, who is site attendant at Kinwegar Recycling Centre in Wallyford, was joined by seven colleagues from the council on the memorable trip.Laura-Jane, , and her dad set off from Scotland on January  alongside Ray Montgomery , Paul Ritchie , Lorraine Faulds , William Kelley , Stuart Baxter , Rachael Cormackand Vanessa Sanal .The group began the trip up the near-,-metre-high mountain on the Saturday and reached the summit last Thursday.Then it was back down before flying home on Sunday and back to work on Monday.Laura-Jane, who works as a PR officer, said it was ldquosurreal to think that just a few days earlier she had been standing at the top of Kilimanjaro.Already, more than pound, has been donated to the good cause, with that figure set to rise to pound, when all the money has been donated and counted.Previously, fundraisers have completed a number of other challenges ndash although nothing on the scale of the latest achievement ndash in memory of Vera, who was  when she passed away from cancer in .The West Highland Way, which stretches from Milngavie to Fort William , and the Three Peaks Challenge, which sees the highest peaks in Scotland, England and Wales ndash Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon respectively ndash climbed have been completed.Laura-Jane, who lives in Tranent, said: ldquoI think my mum would think we were off our heads for doing what we have done but really proud of us.

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

Women who complain will be guilty of transphobia, and are likely to be visited by the police recording a ldquohate incident.Now, I have nothing against adults changing their gender, or identying as women, queer, non-binary, intersex or whatever. It seems to be reinforcing outmoded concepts of gender to suggest that, because someone wants to wear dresses, play with dolls and put on makeup, they must have a lady brain in a male body. I thought we had left pink-for-girls gender stereotyping behind. But never mind. No-one wishes trans people any ill ndash certainly not me. But now that we are abandoning the very biological definition of sex, there are some anomalies that need to be addressed.Last week, a British transgender man, who had IVF by sperm donation and gave birth, won a court battle to prevent his child having ldquomother on its birth certicate. It will be the first child in history to have no mother. The The AIRE Centre, a human rights charity, contested this on the grounds that it would make le dficult for the child in future, when they apply for visas or anything which enquires about family background. The Government said simply that this isnrsquot a problem. From now on, fathers can give birth ndash end of.But Irsquom not sure this is the end of the matter. Children have not been included in the gender recognition debate thus far, even though they have rights too. It could be psychologically disturbing for a child to find, one day, that its mother has decided to become its dad. That song ldquoSometimes I feel like a motherless child takes on a whole new meaning.Of course, the trans parent will still be present, but is it OK to expect a child to suddenly start calling her natural mother her father  I would have thought that a child has a continuing right to a legal motherthey were born with one. If misgendering a trans person is unacceptable, surely demothering a child should be too. This is going to be confusing to say the least.Then there is the question of sport. The controversy over athlete Caster Semenya, a woman with high testosterone, raises the question of how to regard trans womenrsquos participation in women-only sport. Athletes who have testes, and therefore posses greater body mass, muscle strength and bone density, have an unfair advantage over old-fashioned women who have genetically female bodies.Next week, the International Association of Athletics Federations will argue in a hearing in Switzerland that people like Semenya should take testosterone-suppressing drugs before competing. Not only would this drive a coach and horses through the anti-doping protocols, it surely poses problem for transgender athletes who, of course, also take drugs like testosterone to help them transition to their ldquocorrect male sex. I hope the sporting authorities can get their heads around that because I canrsquot.Yet this is a very live issue in many sports. In the US, the ban on trans women taking part in power-lting events is being lted to prevent accusations of discrimination. You might have thought that having beefy, male-bodied women participating in these contests is discriminating against women athletes. Though, of course, only transphobes would say that, so we wonrsquot go there.The logical solution to this conundrum is to end sexual segregation in sport. Andwomen who are born biologically female never win any medals, tough. Strangely, there doesnrsquot seem to be the same issue about female-bodied trans men participating in male-only sport . Irsquom sure that has nothing whatever to do with the fact that they wonrsquot win anything.So welcome to the brave new world of post-sexual dferentiation, where men become women and fathers have children. It is one of the most radical and abrupt cultural changes in human history.Women have had a pretty bad deal in previous centuries, when they were regarded often as chattels without rights. In some Muslim societies theyrsquore still second-class citizens. Now, as women are finally emerging from the shadow of patriarchy, they are being told, by men, that they no longer have exclusive rights to their sexual identity.Itrsquos a weird turn of events. It seems women are just on the wrong side of history. But somehow, I donrsquot think theyrsquoll go quietly."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-gateway-to-scotland-the-best-charles-rennie-mackintosh-within-90-minutes","story":"The striking beauty and modernity of the work was not fully appreciated in his letime, though the vision of its ambitious creator is now recognised and celebrated around the world.

He has spoken to priests, cardinals, bishops, monsignors, papal ambassadors, seminarians and the Swiss Guard. His conclusion, which will shock some and come as no surprise to others, is that about  per cent of the clergy in the Vatican state are gay. In other words, the HQ of a church that will not bless same-sex relationships, and forbids its clergy to have sex lives, is riddled with hyprocisy at its very core.Of these  per cent, Martel writes, some are celibate or in denial, others are living with their partners, or resort to prostitutes. A rule of thumb is that the more vehemently a cleric condemns homosexuality, the more likely he is to be in the closet himself. Hence the behaviour of the Colombian cardinal, Alfonso Lopez Trujillo. He was in the vanguard of the churchrsquos mission to prevent gay marriage. As the dire consequences of the Aids epidemic became clear, contrary to commonsense and compassion, he refused to encourage the use of condoms. Here was someone eager to be seen to uphold traditional values. Yet Martel claims that Trujillo, who died in , used male prostitutes.There are examples closer to home, among them the late Cardinal Keith OrsquoBrien, who pursued a similarly denunciatory anti-gay agenda, despite his own homosexuality and predatory behaviour. In fact, it doesnrsquot matter where you look. Throughout the Catholic churchrsquos parishes, globally and locally, there has been the mother of all cover-ups, not just in the buttoned-up past, but right now, here, today.You could say the church has been built on lies: countless men forced to hide who they really are, or to seek refuge in an all-male environment where they could find illicit love behind closed doors. Those clergy who were straight must have found themselves in a bewildering labyrinth of duplicity. That such depths of deceit have been allowed to thrive says all you need to know about the controlling power of those at the heart of the church.Martel believes that Pope Francis has earned enemies by adopting a very untypical approach. ldquoWho am I to judge  he replied, when askedhe condemned homosexuals, thereby loosening the ground beneath the feet of those in the Holy See who donrsquot want their secrets aired, or their way of le altered.The revelation of such widespread double standards is an echo of the medieval churchrsquos calamitous abuse of power and wealth. Out of it has sprung a culture where bullying, intimidation and blackmail have flourished. Andthat has been going on in this sphere, you can be sure it will have spilled over into every other part of the churchrsquos affairs.In the wake of the revelation of child abuse on a grand scale in the church, you begin to see why hiding the truth was the default position. This is not to make a link between homosexuality and child abuse but to see why the ecclesiastical authorities were so quick, and adept, at making the problem disappear. In avoiding scandal, they were intent on protecting their own rather than those who had been so grievously harmed.With evidence of institutionalised deception of the extent Martel claims, the church brings shame on itself: not for the numbers of priests who are gay, but for the willingness to lie about it, and to break vows, and the spirit of vocation, to an extent that will appall devout parishioners.Now is the time for the Catholic Churchrsquos own Reformation. No-one can any longer doubt that the le expected of a Catholic priest is unhealthy. And since there is no biblical injunction on him to be celibate, why can this not be changed  Already the church is embracing married Anglican vicars in flight from the ordination of women. Why not allow Catholic clergy the same right to open relationships, whether they be gay or straight Until the double-speak on which the modern church stands is addressed, there is no hope of winning back the faithful who have lost all trust and respect in this once revered institution. Obliging men to profess one thing while being another, is psychological torment. The denial of clergyrsquos humanity and self-expression is as cruel as anything the Inquisition devised. If the Vatican could bring itself to accept homosexuality, and gay marriage, and a non-celibate priesthood, it would be a truly Christian act.Read more: Cardinal Keith OBrien asked for forgiveness"},{"url":null,"title":"joanna-blythman-reviews-locarno-in-glasgow","story":"WErsquoVE decided to have one farinaceous main course at Locarno to keep down the total cost because the other mains are so expensive: pound. to pound..

Even the number of priests who have resigned the ministry, or those who have requested dispensation for clerical celibacy, those numbers are not forthcoming from the Vatican.\"That would help with the conversation about whether celibacy is working for the majority of Catholic priests. Clearly we know it isnrsquot.\"Now that we have the gay debacle as well ndash there are a number of gay priests in the priesthood, and that needs to be acknowledged instead of covered up.\"All of this is about keeping the lid on Pandorarsquos box because once you allow priests to marry, then we get into the situation of priestsrsquo marriages breaking down, wanting orce, wanting to remarry. How can you keep the lid on that reality which the church doesnrsquot accept or condone  That is why this control of the celibacy rule for priests is key.\"Mr Walker explained that another reason why many priests may want to keep the fact they have children a secret is because many are ill-equipped to deal with secular le.He said: \"When I left the ministry I had something like pound in my bank account.

The church should make it the number one priority for the priest also.\"A brief history of celibacy in the Catholic ChurchCatholic priests were not always required to be celibate, with several of the Apostles known to be married according to biblical accounts.The very first Pope, Saint Peter, was married and there are ious accounts of priests and popes throughout the ages discussing the issue of celibacy in letters and correspondence.Clement of Alexandria, a prominent theologian who died in AD, wrote: \"The church fully receives the husband of one we whether he be priest or deacon or layman, supposing always that he uses his marriage blamelessly, and such a one shall be saved in the begetting of children.By AD, the first written requirement was made for those looking to join the priesthood to be celibate, and in  AD, Pope Gregory VII ruled that married priests were not allowed to say mass or carry out s.In , an ecumenical council for the Catholic church made celibacy mandatory for western clergy.In , Pope Francis said he would consider the possibility of allowing married men to join the priesthood, which is set to be discussed further this year."},{"url":null,"title":"catholic-church-faces-mounting-pressure-to-help-traumatised-scots-children-of-priests","story":"One organisation which is supporting Scots whose fathers are clerics says people are left scared and traumatised by their secretive upbringings, and feel as though the church is trying to pretend they donrsquot exist.Some have even had to sign confidentiality agreements to hide their paternal identities, according to Coping International, which advocates for children of priests.Children have also been sent to Scotland from Ireland and England as a way of keeping them hidden from parish communities which may find out about their parentage.The impact on those involved is severe and detrimental, according to campaigners, who describe their treatment and lack of acknowledgement as ldquoclerical abuse.The Catholic church in Scotland has admitted it has no idea how many Scottish priests, or those working in Scotland, have fathered children.A spokesman has also compared the situation to office workers having extramarital affairs, and said the church as an employer wouldnrsquot necessarily have to get involved.It comes after secret Vatican guidelines emerged this week for priests who father children, but the church has refused to release the documents or explain what advice they contained.Vincent Doyle, founder of support organisation Coping International, has blasted Scottish bishops for failing to get to grips with the scale of the issue, and said more needs to be done to support women and prieststhey find they are expecting a baby.Irish psychotherapist Doyle set up Coping International after he found out a priest he believed was his godfather was actually his biological dad. He said he is currently supporting several Scots between  and  whose fathers are priests, who, he said, have been left scarred by their covert parentage and are afraid to speak out.However, he stressed that the actual number of children, men and women across the globe whose fathers are Scottish priests, or who live in Scotland, is likely to be much higher.Sonflowers, a support group for women who have had relationships with priests, previously reported that it had been inundated with calls from Scottish women claiming they were having relationships with priests and in some cases were pregnant by them.The organisationrsquos founder said in  she had hoped to set up a specically Scottish group to deal with the influx of calls but faced opposition to even advertising her service in churches or bulletins across the country.Doyle said: ldquoWe are supporting eight Scottish people. Eight may seem like a small number to many, but for those eight people their lives have been hugely affected.ldquoThey have been hidden, they have had confidentiality agreements too. They are scared.ldquoWe have one Scottish woman we are working with who was fathered by an Irish priest. They moved to Scotland and hid her there and she has hidden ever since. She doesnrsquot know what to do or how to bring it up.ldquoThese people are terried. One guy I know has psychosis, hersquos on the verge of schizophrenia.ldquoWe have a lot of kids also from Ireland and England sent to Scotland, who were adopted but now through things like ancestry and DNA matching sites they are finding out their roots and what actually happened.ldquoThere are around  priests in Scotland at the minute, but how many men have been ordained in Scotland or how many Scottish men have been missionary priests over the last  years  That is where the real question is.ldquoWhen you take that into consideration,only % of those priests fathered children, yoursquore talking about a surprising number.ldquoOn a global level, we know about , children in this position and that is only the ones we know about, itrsquos a hugely conservative estimate.A Catholic church spokesman told The Herald on Sunday there was no evidence of ldquosignicant numbers of children fathered by priests in Scotland, and compared priests having relationships to an office worker having an extramarital affair with a colleague.He said in both scenarios, vows would have been broken but it would not necessarily be the responsibility of the employer to get involved.When pressed, he admitted the church had no idea of the numbers and he had only heard of one such case before, but insisted that Scottish bishops would support prieststhey came to them to ask for help.The spokesman said: ldquoIn the case of a priest who has fathered a child, it is not possible to rule out any possible responses to these situations.ldquoA decision to remain or leave the priesthood would be made on its merits in each case.ldquoThere are no central records of such cases and while the church would not necessarily be aware of them, there is no suggestion of signicant numbers in this country.He also said there had been several priests who had left the priesthood to pursue relationships, and in his view there was no stigma around the issue.He said: ldquoIf a priest was to say to his bishop that he had fathered a child and, whether he wanted help to leave the priesthood and set up as a father or to remain in the priesthood but be able to support the child, the church would do whatever they could to support either of those options.ldquoEvery year a number [of priests] leave to get married. One left from Glasgow last year, for example. In the past that would have been seen as much more scandalous and a stigma. The view now is that the church is grateful for the service that you have given.Doyle has criticised the remarks and called for the church in Scotland to take the lead in finding and supporting people fathered by priests, and to understand why many priests do not disclose they have children.He said: ldquoI absolutely condemn the use of that world lsquosignicantrsquo in any regard. This is clerical abuse. If there are only five or  children in Scotland, so what  Quantity never should come in to pastoral care.ldquoIn order for this issue to be addressed we have to do away with moralistic audacious statements and look at this practically and also empower the woman. If you empower the mother and say lsquoyou are far from alone, you donrsquot need to be afraidrsquo, it would help, instead of the woman being told they are the only person in Scotland who is in this situation, and they must keep quiet in order for the priest to be able to support them and not lose their job.ldquoI would go back to the Catholic bishops in Scotland and ask them what constitutes a signicant number. We are working with eight people ndash is that insignicant  I donrsquot know the full number of children of priests in Scotland, but neither do the bishops.ldquoThe Catholic church should be willing to bend over backwards for one child so this whole thing of lsquosignicancersquo is hugely disrespectful, harmful and what they are trying to do is make this inauthentic.ldquoThere are children of priests the same as there are children of plumbers, fishermen, hairdressers ... they are out there.ldquoAnd it is never going to stop. Unless they stop ordaining heterosexual males it will happen. They canrsquot quanty it and they canrsquot address it.ldquoThe church have tried to dismiss child sexual abuse initially by saying its unquantiable, itrsquos the same thing.If you have been affected by this story please contact Hannah Rodgerathannah.rodger@heraldandtimes"},{"url":null,"title":"in-pictures-homes-transformed-into-magnificent-galleries-at-window-wanderland","story":"An annual tradition, locals decorated their windows with colourful, ornate designs.One home even renamed itself the Bungo Jukebox, decorating every window with a musical theme.Another featured a controversial message about the recent Glasgow School of Art fire.Hundreds walked the streets and marvelled at the fantastic displays, while others attended film screenings at a pop-up cinema.The Pollywood community cinema showed Rear Window by Alfred Hitchcock along with several other flicks throughout the evening."},{"url":null,"title":"cool-list-the-best-scottish-railway-journeys","story":" Edinburgh to AberdourThink ldquotrains and ldquoScotland then let your mind come to rest on the third image that comes to you.

Leadhills to WanlockheadIf geographical trivia is your specialist subject at the local pub quiz then you donrsquot need telling that Wanlockhead is Scotlandrsquos highest village or that itrsquos located not in the Highlands but in the Lowther Hills in Dumfries and Gallowayrsquos Southern Uplands. If all that comes as news to you and you fancy a visit, donrsquot miss this treat. The railway is a narrow gauge and runs along the track bed of what was once a branch line on the Caledonian Railway to Wanlockhead from nearby Elvanfoot.It closed in  and shortly afterwards the lead mines it served were mothballed, so now the railway mostly pulls tourists along the kilometre or so between the two villages. Naturally, Wanlockhead also boasts Scotlandrsquos highest pub, the perfect place to read Robert Burnsrsquos poem Pegasus At Wanlockhead, written over a dram in another local hostelry as he waited for the horse of that name to have a shoe tended to by the village blacksmith. Inverness to WickKnown as the Far North Line for obvious reasons, this four-and-a-half-hour, -mile journey sees the train follow the coast for much of the way. Among the stops is one practically at the gates of the magnicent Dunrobin Castle, completed in the s at the behest of the owner who quite fancied having his own railway line. It required the say-so of Parliament but given that the owner was the Duke of Sutherland, the permissions werenrsquot too hard to get.Other highlights include Skibo Castle, Foulis Castle, the atmospheric peat bogsand the distilleries of Teaninich, Dalmore, Balblair, Whyte  Mackay , Glenmorangie , and, in Wick itself, Pulteney . Inverness to Kyle of LochalshIf yoursquore heading for Skye from the capital of the Highlands, then the so-called Kyle Line is the only way to travel. The line runs along the Beauly Firth, through Dingwall and on past villages such as Achnashellach, Achnasheen, Lochcarron and picturesque Plockton, where much-loved BBC drama Hamish Macbeth was filmed. Naturally there are great views of Skye itself at the end of the line but along the way yoursquoll also see the Torridon Peaks, Ben Wyvis, Loch Luichart and Loch Carron as well as some rugged Highland scenery. Aviemore to BroomhillThe route isnrsquot so much the treat here as the train itself because itrsquos on these  miles of restored track from the original Highland Railway Line that the Strathspey Steam Railway has run since it was brought back to le by a group of enthusiasts in . It runs between Aviemore stationrsquos  three and Broomhillrsquos Glenbogle station via Boat of Garten and when yoursquore not looking out of the window at the sceneryyoursquoll be looking around the old-style carriages or even down at your plate ndash the service offers all manner of dining experiences, from light lunches and afternoon teas to formal evening meals. Dufftown to KeithThis -mile line links the Moray towns of Keith and Dufftown, the self-styled ldquoWhisky Capital of the World . Predictably the line itself, once part of the Aberdeen to Elgin line, is known now as the Whisky Line and also bills itself the UKrsquos most northerly ldquoheritage railway. The rolling stock includes old commuter carriages from the s and s, and a dining coach which used to be part of the British Rail InterCity stock, but which has been repainted and renamed Spirit Of Dufftown. The line is closed for the winter and reopens on April . Borsquoness to Manuel JunctionOne of Scotlandrsquos most popular heritage railways, the Borsquoness and Kinneil Railway runs five miles between Borsquoness near Falkirk and Manuel Junction, via Kinneil and Birkhill. The views are pretty enough but again itrsquos the rolling stock which is the star.Among the favourites are  Neilson Reid locomotive Lord Roberts, which has been painted Thomas The Tank Engine blue, a set of s coaches in whatrsquos known as a ldquoblood and custard livery, and a pair of Caledonian coaches built in . Borsquoness is also home to the Museum of Scottish Railways, which houses historic locomotives, carriages, cranes, wagonsas well as shunting units, motorised trolleys and all manner of objects and archive stuff. Edinburgh to TweedbankThe Borders line, closed in  as part of the infamous Beeching cuts, reopened with no little fanfare in September  and reconnected the capital with the Borders towns of Galashiels and Melroseas well as Midlothian towns such as Dalkeith, Newtongrange and Gorebridge. The scenery is pleasant enough ndash go to the Highlandsyou want mountains and lochs ndash but the appeal of the Borders Railway, as itrsquos now known, lies in its ality and its historical importance: its rebirth brought a new dynamism and opportunity to a part of the country too often overlooked, and signicant numbers of tourists as well. Book lovers in particular have good reason to take the trip. Where  can you take a train which starts from a station named after a famous novel ndash Waverley, by Sir Walter Scott ndash and terminates close to the authorrsquos home, in this case Abbotsford, near Melrose  Milton of Crathes to Birkenbaud CrossingItrsquos only a mile of track along the now-disused Ballater to Aberdeen line, but as the name suggests the Royal Deeside Railway is steeped in history, thanks to the fact that for over a century, until its closure in , it was used by the royal family travelling to Ballater and from there to nearby Balmoral Castle. It was even used by ill-fated Russian tsar Nicholas II when he visited in .The original Crathes Castle station was built initially for the private use of the Laird of Crathes, and only later was the public allowed to use it. The Milton of Crathes station features a Victorian building but it came originally from Oldmeldrum and was sold to the Royal Deeside Railway for pound then transported to its new home in carefully labelled sections.The line has both steam- and diesel-hauled trains and among the former is the Thomas The Tank Engine-style Salmon. A sombre coda: the engine was named in commemoration of HMS Salmon, a submarine lost with all hands in . The line is closed for the winter and will reopen at Easter.How the Borders Railway creates a new future for Scotlands \"forgotten\" regionTravel: the West Highland Line"},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-money-are-we-spending-it-properly","story":"Itrsquos two days before the Budget and Derek Mackay, Scotlandrsquos Finance Secretary, is sitting in his spartan ministerial office robustly defending his spending plans ndash while dealing with a nasty cold.Hersquos a man facing an almost impossible array of demands. Some of the brightest minds, and biggest voices, are calling for him to pull to the left, pull to the right, protect the poor, and boost business ndash all at the same time. Mackay ndash self-contained, confident and smartly dressed ndash may see himself as a steady pair of hands, but hersquod need the skill of a juggler to make everyone happy.At its heart, the Budget is redistributive ndash taking from the rich to provide services for the poor by widening the gap between how much higher earners pay in income tax in Scotland compared with the rest of the UK. Mackay has frozen the higher rate threshold at pound, in Scotland, while it will go up to pound, in the rest of the UK. However, everyone earning under pound, ndash % of taxpayers ndash will end up paying less income tax than in the rest of the UK.The spending plans also provide extra money for education , health , and infrastructure , and give new powers to councils to introduce a workplace car parking tax and a tourist tax. Local authorities get an extra poundm and can also increase council tax by up to .% rather than %.But what do the people who spend their lives studying the Scottish economy make of the Budget  Does the way Scotland spends its money work  Where could money be spent better  And what ideas might change the game when it comes to Scotland and out public services Some of the leading lights in Scottish public le give their views.PROFESSOR RONALD MACDONALDECONOMIST WITH THE ADAM SMITH BUSINESS SCHOOL AT GLASGOW UNIVERSITYRonnie MacDonald is happy to pay more tax, but he isnrsquot so happy with the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach to balancing the books. ldquoThe focus seems to be too much on spending ndash there isnrsquot so much emphasis on growing the economy, he says.About half the revenue raised comes from taxes, he says, and our ldquoeconomy is very skewed towards oil ndash a commodity in price decline. ldquoItrsquos a dangerous strategy for the long-term sustainability of public spending, MacDonald says.With limited borrowing powers, the Government has a choice between \"growing the economy or spending less\". The Government is following a Nordic-style model of public spending, he says.However, ldquothese Nordic countries grew their economies before making spending changes, we seem to be doing it the other way around.ldquoI think wersquoll ultimately have to cut spending, he adds. ldquoYou either prioritise and have a leaner mix now, or yoursquore forced to do it in the future ndash you could face much worse cuts in the future.Higher taxes in Scotland ldquomay well put off foreign firms thinking of investing in Scotland, he says. ldquoIf Irsquom a US-based company thinking of Scotland or the north of England, Irsquom going to go where the tax regime is more favourable to my employees. All in all itrsquos quite a dangerous game theyrsquore playing.Macdonald suggests a ldquorealignment from spending ldquotowards lowering business rates to encourage growth.A more erse economy would grow more quickly, says MacDonald, and provide the money needed for the ldquopublic provision the SNP wants to offer. Manufacturing around le sciences and new technology is one way forward.MacDonald suggests Scotland should follow the path of Australia ndash currently blazing a trail with the solar production of renewable hydrogen as a green energy source. Renewable hydrogen, says MacDonald, can be stored and shipped in liquid form. Given Scotlandrsquos wind and waves, wersquod be in a perfect position to exploit the new technology in the era of climate change.ldquoIt could be revolutionary, MacDonald says. ldquoIt could be as important as the discovery of oil ... it could lead to the reindustrialisation of Scotland.If the Government used public money to invest in the new technology ldquoit could create a sovereign wealth fund as the Norwegians did to use oil to pay for services.DAVE MOXHAMSTUC DEPUTY GENERAL SECRETARYldquoThe Budget is incredibly timid, says Moxham. ldquoWith the current ambition of a little bit more tax on middle- to higher-income earners, itrsquos quite impossible to fund the public services we need without the recognition that people on median and above incomes are going to have to pay more in taxation.\"We canrsquot pretend therersquos any mechanism for funding public services which doesnrsquot have that sort of ambition.ldquoItrsquos not enough to constantly use a Conservative Government as a comparator and say wersquore being slightly more progressive. Any party which aspires to say Scotland would be dferent under independence needs to be showing more now about what their commitment is to social justice.The STUC, says Moxham, would be ldquocomfortable with everyone above median income ndash about pound, ndash paying an extra penny in tax. ldquoThatrsquos small change. Itrsquos hardly bank-breaking, he adds.Spending needs to get smarter and more local too, Moxham says. Councils and council staff need more say in spending ndash as they understand the problems. ldquoTherersquos too much centralisation and not enough devolution to local authorities, he adds.He cites hospitals improving heart failure response times because ldquothe porters helped design the system of getting someone from the front steps to the operating theatre.ldquoWersquove had lots of reorganisation of the delivery of public services but these have tended to be executive-led, he says. Whatrsquos needed is getting the people who deliver the services ndash carers, nurses, teachers ndash to help design services. ldquoThe person who best knows how to organise a home care service is probably the home carer on the ground.The big idea that the STUC is investigating is a ldquouniversal basic infrastructure ndash where everyone has the guaranteed right to decent transport, housing, clinics and schools. Public spending priorities would be re-engineered around making sure every citizen had the basic infrastructure for a decent le.Small business bonus schemes are in the STUCrsquos sights. ldquoWe need a completely new approach to business tax giveaways, says Moxham. Investing in specic high-street regeneration schemes ldquois a far better way to rebuild our local high streets than the current approach where someone may need the boost, but others are using it to fund a second car.TRACY BLACKDIRECTOR OF CBI SCOTLANDIF the Government stimulates the white heat of technology it can fill its coffers with tax pounds and use the money to spend on the public services it wants ndash thatrsquos essentially Blackrsquos view.A no-deal Brexit could cost Scotland poundbn a year by , she says, and our demographics are going against us with a rapidly ageing population, so we need to start spending as smartly as we can. AI and automation could reduce costs. The elderly donrsquot have to travel to hospital when their blood pressure could be checked by remote monitoring. Investment in smart-ticketing and autonomous vehicles could help the high street.Glasgow may be a G hub, but connectivity needs improved across the country, as does infrastructure, Black says, so ldquowe get goods and people moving around more effectively.One big idea that Black is promoting is using national data to change how we spend public money. Data on the economy and population could be used by business ldquoto come up with really creative solutions around transport and health.The Scottish Government has done well so far supporting science and technology in business. Black says our pharma manufacturing sector is one of the most advanced in the world ndash itrsquos now the second-biggest spender on research and development, exports poundm in products, and has seen jobs rise by .%. The Medicines Manufacturing Innovation Centre in Renfrewshire was l funded by the Government and industry.Itrsquos this close working relationship between Government and industry that Black wants more of ndash but she feels there are ldquomixed messages when it comes to income tax, parking levies and the tourist tax. ldquoNone of these on their own are particularly crippling, but you put the whole package together and what sort of signal does that put out to inward investors PROFESSOR GRAEME ROYDIRECTOR OF THE FRASER OF ALLANDER INSTITUTE\"THE debate around public spending collapses down into short-term political sound bites rather than more intelligent conversations,\" says Roy. \"We see that every week at First Ministerrsquos Questions and in every manesto that every party produces.\"Parties obsess on issues like \", more nurses or , extra police officers\" when they should be looking at outcomes ndash like extending le expectancy or making streets safer. It may be that spending more money on housing rather than nurses will improve le expectancy. Preventative measures ndash that improve health or cut crime ndash will save money in the long run.\"Simple metrics donrsquot do anything for the long-term delivery of better value for public services,\" Roy says. \"Therersquos a fixation on targets and numbers when the evidence is that you should be bolder.\"He adds: \"If wersquore thinking about long-term sustainability of public services what we need to do is reduce demand, not just keep increasing supply.\"Such a quantum sht in how we look at public spending would require political courage. Politicians are locked in short election cycles, while long-term preventative policies might take decades to show fruit, Roy says. Closing a hospital because it makes more sense to spend the money on nutrition for the young could lose a government an election, even though  years from now it might have improved health.\"Some of the delivery of public services is simply not going to be sustainable in the long run,\" Roy says. \"Wersquove played with numbers where we think that on current projections NHS spending will within the next two or three years be pretty much % of the Scottish Budget. This will mean every other area in the public sector has to be squeezed ndash thatrsquos the sort of thing which I think will start to force more radical thoughts on how we deliver public services.\"JOHN DICKIEDIRECTOR, CHILD POVERTY ACTION GROUPDickie is clear that Scotlandrsquos public spending does not match the ambition of the Government when it comes to tackling child poverty. Targets have been set that less than % of children should be living in poverty by .With currently one in four Scots children in poverty ndash thatrsquos about , ndash to reach that target, says Dickie, \"we need a substantial rethink of how we raise revenue and allocate resources to make sure those families on the lowest incomes can give children a decent start in le\". Estimates show that one in three children could be in poverty within a few years.Dickie wants an \"income supplement\" to lt family finances to levels above the poverty line. The government is committed to introducing an income supplement by  ndash however, it hasnrsquot said how that will be delivered or how much it will be.The supplement needs brought in now, Dickie says. \"Families canrsquot wait until .\" He applauds policies like best start grants for families, and improvements in school clothing grants but says \"none of this is on the scale to have the kind of substantive long-term impact to really change the trajectory of child poverty\".Dickie would also like to see the Scottish Government act to top up child benefit by around pound, following cuts by the UK Government.Not tackling child poverty is a drain on the economy ndash with children more likely to get involved in crime, have poor health, and fewer job prospects. \"The government needs to act with urgency,\" Dickie says. It needs to \"recognise the value of the next generation\" and invest.DEREK MITCHELLCHIEF EXECUTIVE, CITIZENS ADVICE SCOTLANDWHEN there are families going to foodbanks and receiving \"cold bags\" of shopping because their gas and electricity has been cut off ndash when % of people in \"food poverty\" are working ndash then for Mitchell \"that doesnrsquot paint a picture of a society where everything is wonderful and great\".\"The simple matter is,\" he says, \"that things are very dficult for lots of people and that doesnrsquot show any sign of abating.\"Public resources need to go to those most in need, Mitchell says. \"Poor people donrsquot have a voice. Wersquove a debate at a political level. We talk about interest rates and mortgage rates, we donrsquot talk about household debt.\"Put simply: wersquore looking at things through the wrong end of the telescope. Get tougher with payday loan companies, force employers to pay decent wages, increase the funeral expense allowance, prioritise affordable rent ndash these are the levers of Government Mitchell wants to see pulled.DEREK MACKAYSCOTTISH FINANCE SECRETARYMACKAYrsquoS childhood shaped his politics. This is a man who didnrsquot grow up easy ndash raised in a council house, he even spent time in a homeless unit after a family break-up. He puts his le lessons into his policies ndash beliefs like ldquothe importance of community, kindness, treating others as you would be treated yourself.ldquoIrsquom very aware of chaotic lestyles, lack of opportunities, intergenerational poverty, he says. Mackay says he struck it lucky by entering politics and getting elected. It changed the direction of his le.Hersquos got a slick command of his portfolio and can rattle off statistics at a dizzying rate ndash but his Budget is assailed from all sides: itrsquos either a hit on the middle classes or it isnrsquot doing enough for the poor.Criticism doesnrsquot faze Mackay though ndash only once does he falter, and even then momentarily, when asked why the SNP needed the Greens to push them in a more progressive direction over policies like the parking levy.In his eyes, the Budget is about stability in the face of ldquocalamity at Westminster sustainability of public services, and stimulus for the economy.Mackay says preventative measures are built in when it comes to public health and early years ndash and the economy of the future is being looked after in terms of innovation on data and infrastructure. Direct investment in Scotland is second only to London, and research and development is at record levels. He makes much of new figures showing unemployment is at an all-time low.However, therersquos only so much the Government can do given the limited range of powers granted to a devolved administration, he says. ldquoWe can grow the economy as an independent countrywe have control of levers like immigration policy, and over a wider basket of taxation powers.Mackay described his current Budget as ldquofair and progressive in that it takes ldquoa bit more from the highest earning section of society. In the next financial year, he says, ldquo% of taxpayers will pay less tax, not more, on their current incomes, and itrsquos only those on or above pound, who will pay more.Itrsquos a ldquobalanced and moderate approach, he thinks. ldquoWersquore building a social security system with a dferent philosophy around dignity and respect, he said, while claiming the UK Government was in a ldquorace to the bottom on tax.While Mackay attempts to create a more progressive Budget, he insists hersquos also trying to remain pro-business as he believes ldquothe best social policy is employment. He dismissed claims of ldquoclass war in his Budget.ldquoIf we donrsquot invest in society and have the necessary safeguards for all then everyone pays for societal failure ndash business and taxpayers pay for this with prisons and unemployment, he says, adding that he believes his Budget presents a ldquopretty good deal.Reformation of council tax is likely to dominate the political discussion soon with plans for cross-party talks to find an alternative. ldquoIf we can find the consensus that could adequately and safety replace it then wersquoll support that, Mackay says. Legislation could be prepared in this Parliament for implementation in the next.Come the end of this Parliament, the country will also be heading towards the time for a review of the ldquofiscal framework set out by the Smith Commission and Scotland Act, which will mean the Government can ask for more powers from Westminster.Mackay admits such an ask wonrsquot be easy as ldquoWestminster concedes nothing without challenge and pressure."},{"url":null,"title":"david-pratt-just-what-is-going-on-in-haiti","story":"THERE is nothing like a coup drsquoetat to bring out the headcase and the hedonist in people.When I first visited Haiti back in , aside from the countryrsquos legions of poor, it seemed almost entirely inhabited by these two species of inidual.The capital Port-au-Prince was in meltdown back then, the cityrsquos ramshackle streets a labyrinth of barricades and blazing tyres, looters, shooters and partygoers.President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was in the process of being deposed from power. In the space of a few weeks, I would watch those same \"bouleds\" once consumed by violence and littered with corpses turn into one giant carnival as thousands crammed to dance the night away to Haitian and Caribbean music.Everywhere around the national palace that had been Aristidersquos lair of power, giant floats drted by while women in flamingo pink dresses, and voodoo priests, partied against the pure white backdrop of the whitewashed palace facade that dazzled in the nighttime dark like an edice of snow.There are few countries in the world that Irsquove been to quite like Haiti. Even fewer that have seen so much turmoil and destruction. It really does beggar belief that such a place exists an hour-and-a-halfrsquos flight from glittering Miami, and less than three hours from New York City. As the books and experts will attest to, Haiti is the poorest country in the Western hemisphere and the worldrsquos least developed outside of Africa ndash and believe me does it show.At night in the cityrsquos Marche en Fer or Iron Market district, crushing poverty forces sex workers, some little more than children, onto the filthy fire-lit streets.This is a two-tier nation that rises from the slums of Cite Soleil and Saint Martin, where hundreds of thousands cram into reclaimed swampland and cemeteries.So congested is it here that people I met said that ldquosht sleeping is common.With many single cupboard-sized rooms too small to house an entire family at any one time, people have been known to bed down on a rota basis, four hours inside and four hours in the alleyways outside.It might be a short distance as the crow flies in Port-au-Prince, but these teeming, humid slums are a world apart from the cool hills above where the wealthy live in the gated communities of Petionville, with their fine restaurants catering to a very dferent side of Haitian le.Right there in that very juxtaposition Haitirsquos inequality lies encapsulated. A chasm between haves and have-nots that for decades has led to political instability and violence which these past weeks has once again reared up and gripped the country.ldquoAfter each election, we are deeper and deeper in a crisis. People are living day-by-day ... If you donrsquot resolve the situation, yoursquoll have another uprising, warned Jean Clarens Renois, a former journalist and presidential candidate last week as street protests in the country intensied.For the last two weeks now, almost unnoticed by the international media, thousands of Haitians have taken to the streets, asking for US-backed president Jovenel Moise and his government to resign. Writing in the New York Times a few months ago, Jake Johnston, an international associate at the Centre for Economic and Policy Research in Washington and an expert on Haiti, told the story of what sparked the current round of unrest.ldquoIt started with a few keystrokes in a living room in Montreal, he wrote.ldquoGilbert Mirambeau Jr, a Haitian filmmaker and writer, took to Twitter on August  to post a photo of himself, blindfolded, holding a piece of cardboard with a simple question written on it in Haitirsquos Creole: ldquoKot Kob Petwo Karibe a    ndash Where is the Petrocaribe money   As Johnston went on to explain in the article, just a few days after Mirambeaursquos tweet, an informal group of young Haitians organised on social media using the hashtag #PetroCaribeChallenge and since then Haitians from all sectors of society have taken to the streets demanding an answer to Mirambeaursquos original question about what became of the Petrocaribe cash.This vast sum of over  billion is part of low-interest loans provided by Petrocaribe, a Venezuela-led oil-purchasing alliance of Caribbean states that since  was aimed at helping Haitirsquos ailing economy. The funds became crucial emergency money to the country following the devastating earthquake of  that laid waste to swathes of Port-au-Prince and beyond.Since then, the missing cash and whole Petrocaribe affair has become a political cause celebre in a country where ordinary people have seen a % hike in fuel prices and double-digit inflation that has made day-to-day survival extremely challenging for more than % of the population.For decades, ordinary Haitians have felt themselves powerless when confronted with this ongoing legacy of corruption and misgovernment. Presented with few alternative options, iniably they take to the streets as a last resort when trying to change things for the better.With so many locked in the grip of protracted poverty their frustration with the countryrsquos level of corruption is understandable. To take but one example following the  earthquake, it became clear that despite foreign donors pledging more than  billion in aid, less than % of that emergency aid spent in their names went directly to Haitians.I well recall in the wake of the earthquake talking to ordinary Haitians who had lost almost everything. One was a woman called Gladys Pierre, a mother who described that day back in  when just before five orsquoclock the mirrors fell from the walls in her family home and the furniture rose up and flew through the air asthrown by a giant malevolent poltergeist.ldquoA big beam slid, and from the chest up Rachelle was crushed against the wall like a mosquito, and I knew my little girl had died, Gladys told me, her voice trailing off.Unimaginable as the horror of her story was, it didnrsquot stop there. Steeling herself, she continued to tell of how her daughterrsquos semi-crushed skull became a grotesque prop for part of the apartment block wall that remained standing.In the following months, so dangerous were those ruins teetering on their macabre headstone that no-one dared enter to remove Rachellersquos corpse.Like many ordinary Haitians who found themselves now living in one of the tarpaulin cities that became semi-permanent fixtures in Port-au-Prince, Gladys and her husband Joel held out little hope of those in power doing much to improve their lives.ldquoYou only see them in their beautul cars and big jeeps driving up and down but they never stop, never get out of the car, talk to us or even congratulate the women and children on their courage, I recall Joel telling me at the time.And so, in the eyes of many Haitians, this sense of helplessness and frustration remains the way they see their lives and once again anger has boiled over in the country.While president Moise has pledged a crackdown on corruption few see little signs of it. Those who have taken to the streets as part of the protest movement in recent weeks have no clear political leader, but Haiti has a huge diaspora that has harnessed social media in its non-violent #PetroCaribeChallenge, campaigning among a population more than half of whom are under  years old.As ever, though, tensions have risen as government repression against the campaigners has become more unrestrained and brutal. Even in the early stages the signs of this were all too clear when last November armed gangs close to the ruling party, together with corrupt police officers, massacred at least  people just days before protests were due to begin.All this time, US influence ndash official or unofficial ndash has never been far from the surface in Haiti. In the latest case of murky US interference, five heavily-armed Americans were arrested in Port-au-Prince last week along with a Haitian man and two Serbians.The Americans are former Navy Seal officers Christopher Michael Osman and Christopher Mark McKinley, and Marine veteran Kent Leland Kroeker, as well as Talon Ray Burton and Dustin Porte. Burton is a private investigator once employed by the controversial private security company formerly known as Blackwater and the State Departmentrsquos diplomatic security service. Inside their vehicles the Haitian police found six automatic rles, six pistols, two professional drones and three satellite phones, and they were also carrying sets of licence plates.ldquoThey said that they were here on a lsquogovernment mission,rsquo ldquo Miami Herald reporter Jacqueline Charles told US National Public Radio. ldquoThey did not specy which government, but then they did tell the police that ... their boss was going to call their boss.Whether they were mercenaries, ldquogovernment contractors of something , the arrest of the Americans while failing to make global headlines triggered wide speculation about why they were in Haiti, particularly among Moisersquos political foes.The possible explanations range from a desire to protect the central bank or foreign assets to potential attacks on anti-government demonstrators and leaders. According to the Haitian police, the men claimed they were on a ldquogovernment mission when they were pulled over about a block away from the nationrsquos central bank.The US government only subsequently intervened after Haitian prime minister Jean Henry Ceant, speaking on CNN, called the group ldquomercenaries and ldquoterrorists. That they were released from prison and immediately flown back to Miami where they faced no charges has only further fuelled the rumour mill and caused political uproar in Haiti.Pierre Esperance, executive director of the National Human Rights Defence Network in Haiti, blasted the decision by US authorities not to charge the men.ldquoWhat the Haitian government did is grave. It shows that they had something they were looking for. The fact that the US took these people and did not charge them, it shows there was a conspiracy. They didnrsquot want them to go before Haitian justice, he told the Miami Herald.On Friday, the protests on the streets of Port-au-Prince showed no signs of abating. ldquoToday we lock down the country again, opposition leader Schiller Louidor told people who gathered for a funeral of two protesters killed earlier in the week, before they marched on the national palace carrying one of the coffins. ldquoWe are asking for justice. We are going to continue to protest. Jovenel Moise can kill as many people as he wants, he still has to go, said Josef Dicles, a cousin of one of the dead men, Onique Gedeus.And so Haiti is mired in turmoil again and just what the future holds is anybodyrsquos guess. But the mysterious presence of armed Americans and the cancellation of this monthrsquos scheduled carnival in Port-au-Prince certainly bodes ill for this long-suffering nation born out of slavery and still consigned to poverty."},{"url":null,"title":"students-sign-open-letter-to-call-for-review-into-universal-credit","story":"The group say UC has ldquofundamentally disregarded students in the way it calculates their income, with lone parents, the disabled and students from low income families among the hardest hit.Paloma Paige, president of the St Andrews University Studentsrsquo Association, is the main signatory of the letter and warns of the long-term impact on access to education.She said: ldquoThe effects on student claimants puts widening access and ersity initiatives at risk. It is simply unacceptable that some of our most vulnerable students are left behind by a policy which should be supporting them.UC is the supposed flagship reform of the benefits system, uniting six lsquolegacyrsquo benefits - including tax credits, housing benefit and unemployment benefit - into one paid monthly, but it has proved hugely controversial. Designed to simply the system, but has proved hugely controversial, with many saying they are worse off and at a greater risk of hunger, debt and rent arrears.According to the National Union of Students , those who claim UC are harder hit than those who work, as for every pound that someone earns through work, they see p deducted from their monthly payments.However, for students who claim UC, their loans and grants are regarded as unearned income and therefore untaxed, so for each pound they receive, they lose the same amount from their claim.In the letter, signed by students from universities including St Andrews, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Stirling and Dundee, they state: ldquoMany students are now finding themselves in a position where it is becoming increasingly dficult to maintain their place at university or colleges up, while trying to keep roofs over their heads and feed and clothe their families. This is particularly true for lone parent students, students with low-income families and disabled students. This is down to Universal Credit and how it deducts student income.ldquoUniversal Credit is the benefit that we are constantly being told is designed to lsquomake work payrsquo, but claimants are finding this is not the case, especially students. Does putting in a full-time working week at university not count as work  Under legacy benefits such as tax credits student income is not taken in to account, allowing families to still receive child tax credit alongside their student loan which would go a long way to helping offset the costs of raising a family, but because Universal Credit classes student income as unearned income it is taken into account and deducted pound for pound, leaving many claimants with no award or very little.The letter adds that the system will ldquostop disadvantaged students taking up places at university that they have worked incredibly hard for and calls on the government to review how students are impacted., adding: ldquoIf this is allowed to continue then we are potentially denying our country of seeing some of our best and brightest from fulfilling their potential and this in turn will have a knock-on effect for universities, who will start to notice a decrease in their student intake.ldquoWhat does this say for the future of our world-renowned university system and research hubs that play such an important part in the world stage  This does not look like the meritocratic society we are told we live in.The open letter calls on the government to review how students are impacted ldquoto allow for more support and to allow families to lt themselves out of the trap of poverty and low paid jobs.It states: ldquoSurely it is in the governmentrsquos interests to re-evaluate thisthey truly want to reduce child poverty, increase upward mobility and prove that we are not the socially closed society that it is increasingly looking like.Ms Faith, who has been campaigning on the issue in her role as president, said the situation at the moment is ldquounacceptable.She said last night: ldquoUniversal Credit has fundamentally disregarded students in the way it calculates student income. This has been felt by students and their representatives across the country, as the -plus signatories of this letter demonstrate.One St Andrews student, Sandra Mitchell, a -year-old single mother, said that after she started her history and inity course at St Andrews, she lost about pound a month in benefit money.Ms Mitchell, from Dundee, said: ldquoIrsquom the only person in the household who brings in any income. Irsquom left with just my student income as I donrsquot get any universal credit.

We do not have a huge amount of knowledge of the Picts in terms of historical sources and what we do have is mostly from external ones.ldquoTherersquos late Roman writings and Irish and Anglo-Saxon sources but all we have from the Picts themselves is the lsquoking listrsquo.ldquoThey are most likely a collection of the Iron Age tribes which lived in Scotland at the time slowly coming together to form a cohesive kingdom.The project set out to investigate sites close to long-standing symbol stones to carry out fresh excavations in the hope of forming a better understanding of this mysterious people.A major discovery was made at Rhynie in Aberdeenshire, a landlocked village south of Huntly on the A, where eight carved Pictish stones ndash among them the carved ldquoRhynie man and the Craw Stane ndash had long been known about.Archaeologists now believe the site was home to a major royal enclosure comprised of several buildings, one of them constructed from massive curved oak beams, surrounded by a wooden wall four to five metres high.But it was fragments from Roman vases known as amphorae recovered in digging work which provided the most tantalising clue to the reach of the Picts.Vase pieces have been found at only three other sites in Scotland, including Dumbarton Rock, the seat of the ancient rulers of the Kingdom of Strathclyde.Those found at Rhynie indicate it may well have been the dwelling place of a high-status Pictish ruler whose world stretched far beyond the north-east.The few records that remain also suggest the Picts may have had a far more unied kingdom than their neighbours to the west, organised along lines seen in Europe and to the south in England.Mr Noble said: ldquoRhynie is the most northern site these fragments have been found at, and they show that the Picts were part of a trading network which stretched far and wide into the Roman world.ldquoThe Picts are quite unusual in having an over-kingship of such an extensive area. In Ireland at this time therersquos more than  or so petty kings ruling very small kingdoms but what we see in Pictland is something thatrsquos a lot more like the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.ldquoThese are not a people on the edge of Europe but one thatrsquos developing like its southern and eastern neighbours.ldquoThere are influences of western art and a great deal of commerce. The Picts are very much a part of wider European developments.More recently, the projectrsquos archaeologists probed the symbol stones themselves and concluded they contain writing as well as art. Crucially, they claim, this developed in the third century and was likely influenced through contact with the written word of the Romans.It is now believed the symbols carved into the stones were a form of naming system that communicated the identities of Pictish people and places and are the last surviving fragments of their language.Mr Noble said: ldquoThese stones occur at prominent places in the land and on Christian Cross slabs on graves, most likely telling something about the personrsquos rank and identity. They were probably developed in a similar way to Ogham script in Ireland and Scandinavian runes.While the Northern Picts Project has gone a long way to re-evaluating their place in Scottish history, much still needs to be done to flesh out the picture.Current work centres on a large fort at Burghead on the Moray coast. This site, which was destroyed in the ninth century, may hold clues to the eventual fate of the Picts.While there is evidence of a slow merging with the western kingdom of the Gaels, the people of the north-east were facing a new threat: the Vikings.Mr Noble added: ldquoThe Vikings were bad news for just about everybody in this period. But therersquos still much we need to know before we can say where the Picts went."},{"url":null,"title":"tv-review-is-the-new-bbc-scotland-channel-magic-or-mince","story":"Three, two, one went the countdown and there was Chvrches singer Lauren Mayberry singing a number which would not be out of place in the next Bond film.

Why are councils getting cuts when there is more money in the pot In my experience the only people who are taken in by this are SNP politicians, in particular SNP councillors, who will happily whistle the ldquomore money theme as a musical accompaniment, while casting their votes to cut vital services for their own constituents.

I must correct Mr Jones in his assertion that \"dissent within the ranks\" of the SNP is not permitted, as lively and robust debates are a feature of SNP branch, constituency and group meetings, but dferences of opinion do not become the open warfare we see raging within the two main unionist parties. Bitter internal squabblings in the Conservative and Labour parties have now boiled over, at least a dozen MPs have left their parties, more are expected to leave, and others, including government ministers, are threatening to leave.Mr Jones argues that within the Unionist parties \"whilst some members may be disenchanted with a party position at least they are free to go their own way\" indeed, they have gone their own way right out of their parties and formed their own group. The reality is that both Labour and the Tories are in not so much as a deep hole as a bottomless pit, and no amount of digging will get them out of it.Ruth Marr, Grampian Road, Stirling.IT would be instructive for those supporting the status quo of government to think carefully of the rules by which certain \"democratic decisions have been made or rather concocted, and which are a backdrop to the present growing appeal of Scottish independence.In  the conditions for the Scottish devolution referendum were imposed by Westminster.

He is staring at Rome, and that is what is there in that block by his leg - so he is looking  years back, but also to the future, back and forward at the same time.Mr Stoddart said he is also currently working on a figure, also for the US, that will be taller.The sculptor noted that the figure of Albert , simply clothed, is distant from the current ldquoimperium of modernism.The artist said that Notre Damersquos School of Architecture, established in , perhaps aptly, emphasises traditional architectural ideals and theories.The architect John Simpson has designed the universityrsquos new School of Architecture building, and has worked with Mr Stoddart before, notably the Queenrsquos Gallery at Buckingham Palace.Mr Stoddart, born in , studied at Glasgow School of Art and the University of Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-the-five-big-hurdles-the-new-bbc-channel-is-going-to-have-to-overcome","story":"This problem with young people has been one of the biggest issues on the minds of BBC producers as they prepare for the new channel and rightly so. The fact the young ones donrsquot watch TV in the way their parents do poses an existential threat to broadcasters, particularly a broadcaster like the BBC that expects everyone to pay for channels eventhey donrsquot watch them. Ironically, the people who do still watch terrestrial TV every day ndash the over s ndash are the only ones who donrsquot have to pay the licence fee.The BBCrsquos response to this problem has been to come up with ideas for the new channel that are firmly aimed at under s. Last night, for example, there was a show presented by Iain Stirling of Love Island. There was also a programme that had a whf of Channel  reality-show about it: Getting Hitched Asian Style. The only old fogies on opening night were Jack and Victor, but even their show, Still Game, is a big hit with the under s.Read more: The Question Time row raises profound questions for the BBCThe big question is whether this strategy is going to work and I have my doubts. Recently, I spent a few days with my godchildren who are aged between nine and , and what was striking about how they spent their time was that they didnrsquot switch on the BBC. Not once. For someone like me, or anyone  in their s who grew up with Basil Brush and Blue Peter, thatrsquos pretty extraordinary: young people arenrsquot watching the BBC regularlyat all. The question is: will they change their habits as they get older or is it the BBC that will have to change For the moment, the makers of the new channel are proceeding on the basis that they can still attract young viewers. But whether they can or not is just the first of the hurdles the channel is going to have to overcome, the second being whether they can attract an audience in the way that matters. In the old days, TV was about overnight viewing figures ndash bums on seats ndash but the director of BBC Scotland, Donalda MacKinnon, has already been managing expectations by saying the new channel will not be about the size of the audience. Thatrsquos not-very-subtle code for: the traditional viewing figures for the new channel are going to be very low.The question is whether it matters and, in a way, it doesnrsquot because viewing figures are not as important as they once were - itrsquos just as important that a programme does well on iPlayer and social media. That means that, to prove its worth, the channel is going to have to do well online and produce programmes that are shared by a younger audience. The fact that one of the early programmes is about the make-up artist Jamie Genevieve is a clue to where wersquore going here ndash she has more than a million Instagram followers.Where it gets dficult is whether the BBC can rise to this challenge, which leads to the third hurdle: the balance problem. The BBC is proud of its policy on balance but, as I pointed out in my column on Question Time the other day, the BBCrsquos idea of balance has led it to the ludicrous position that, for every environmental scientist on TV, there has to be a climate-change denier. ldquoBalance can also lead to some very dull TV and thatrsquos not going to help the new channel get its news reports shared online. People increasingly like news with attitude whereas the BBC does sensible. Sensible doesnrsquot go viral.The fourth, and perhaps the biggest, hurdle for the new channel is also, in a way, the reason for its creation in the first place. For years, there was pressure from the SNP for a Scottish Six news programe and the new channel is the end result ndash in other words, itrsquos the BBCrsquos response to a political argument rather than audience demand. The problem for the BBC, though, is the Scottish nationalists who most loudly demanded change are also the least likely to watch the new coverage because of its perceived bias ndash most of the talk among this group is about the reasons they wonrsquot watch.Read more: Of course the BBC is biasedThe recent row over an alleged plant in the audience of Question Time has not helped in this regard. There has also been very little evidence that the BBC is willing to seriously consider whether theyrsquore getting it right on alleged bias. In fact, Hayley Valentine, the editor of the new Scottish Nine news programme, made the extraordinary statement that she did not know ldquoa single journalist who brought any bias to work with them which is anti-logic of the worst kind: BBC journalists have bias just like any other human does, which is why the BBC has rules to try to overcome it.The allegation of bias also has serious consequences for the Scottish version of Question Time which is doomed to death by a thousand nationalist cuts before it even starts. The programme also faces the fth and final hurdle, which is money. BBC Scotland has already admitted they cannot afford to take their Scottish Question Time around the country which will not only make the channel feel Glasgow-centric , it will highlight the fact that the new channel simply doesnrsquot have the money it needs.Can the new channel get over these hurdles  Possibly, but remember previous experiments by the BBC. BBC Choice, which included regional iations for Scotland ndash axed in . The Scottish version of Newsnight ndash axed in . Scotland , which had average viewing figures as low as , ndash axed after less than three years. Perhaps the new BBC channel will be dferent to all of those, but it has something of the same feel doesnrsquot it  An attempt to be dferent without any great ability to be interesting. An attempt to be Scottish when very few people are watching."},{"url":null,"title":"oscars-olivia-colman-wins-best-actress-for-the-favourite","story":"The star of The Favourite triumphed over The Wersquos Close, as well as Lady Gaga, Melissa McCarthy and Yalitza Aparicio for an unexpected win at the ceremony, where Green Book was named best picture.Colman was visibly shocked as her name was called and was helped to her feet by her husband Ed Sinclair and co-star Emma Stone, who planted a kiss on her cheek.Taking to the stage, she said: ldquoItrsquos genuinely quite stressful.

This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others.

The new software — which can be used on desktops and mobile browsers — allows website visitors to customise what they see and hear, from changing the contrast settings, language, font size and more.In the UK, there are estimated to be . million people with a learning disability and . million people who have English as a second language. ‘Recite Me’ has the ability to translate the NorthLink Ferries website into more than  languages — including Scots Gaelic . It can also translate text-to-speech to help visually impaired users and focus screen areas for those with dyslexia.On Monday, February , teams on board MV Hamnavoe hosted an Access Panel Orkney session, where staff were provided with disability awareness training. During the two-hour session, staff were able to experience what it’s like to have a disability by wearing glasses that simulated blindness, used wheelchairs and crutches and had their hearing dampened.Carolyn Grfiths of Access Panel Orkney said: “The aim of our session was to let staff experience disabilities first-hand so they can empathise with passengers’ needs.#All of us running the training have a disability so we were able to provide first-hand examples of what accessible travel is like for us. We were delighted to be welcomed on board to provide this training and it’s great to see a company like Serco NorthLink Ferries take accessibility for passengers seriously.”The MV Hjaltland will also host a Making Connections workshop today, Friday, February . The workshop will look at how passengers navigate potential barriers when changing from one mode of transport to another. Making Connections brings disabled people together with transport operators to discuss, address and plan how travel connections can be made easier.Seumas Campbell, customer service director at NorthLink Ferries, said: “Catering for passengers with ying degrees of disability is an important part of our service provision. Whether they are using our website to book their journey, making a connection from other forms of public transport or coming on board one of our vessels, we believe that passengers should experience a service that caters to all their needs.“The new website software will allow visitors to customise what they see and hear and as more and more visitors from around the world choose NorthLink Ferries to travel to the Northern Isles, ‘Recite Me’ is a great tool to help them plan and book their journey.“Our workshops are also a great way in training our staff on how they can best help and understand passengers’ needs. We pride ourselves on having a great team that always provides the best service so it’s important that we’re constantly refreshing their training.”For more information on accessibility for passengers on NorthLink Ferries, you can visit www.northlinkferries copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This was despite the fact that the name and address of the person they needed to contact — his mother Edna — was engraved on the memorial.#Vandals couldn#t have done a better job,# he said.Following this wave of public concern, OIC convener Harvey Johnston and chief executive Alistair Buchan have now released a statement apologising for the concern and upset that this project has caused.#Following a tragic accident involving a young child at a Glasgow cemetery, the Scottish Government asked councils to carry out detailed inspections in the interests of public safety,# they said.#We therefore engaged in the kirkyard safety programme for all the right reasons, but recognise that the process we have followed needs to be improved. It was never envisaged that the resulting work would leave kirkyards in the condition they are in. We are sorry about the concern and upset this has led to.#As a caring organisation, responsive to public concern, we will restore kirkyards to the condition people would expect. We will also consider how best to contact and discuss the remedial work required with those concerned. People’s safety is an important concern for us and we will continue to carry out headstone inspections. As at Warebeth , we will use blue pegs to mark stones identied as being unsafe and highlight these to local community representatives.#These stones will not be touched until we publicise the inspection results and give relatives the time they need to discuss with us any work they might wish to carry out themselves.#The statement also confirmed that further updates from the council will be provided further updates over the weeks ahead.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Known today as Rae Strait, it was the missing link in what would become the first navigable Northwest Passage.He also reported back on the ill-fated Franklin expedition, reported evidence of cannibalism — findings which were effectively rejected by the then establishment, and which led to Rae#s achievements being almost completely ignored.The modern-day team, who hope to raise further awareness of these achievements, will be led by Scottish-born and Canada-based expedition leader David Reid, with Scotland also represented by Broxburn-based former Royal Marine Richard Smith.The team will also include two Canadians — adventure film-maker Gerry Tutte and adventurer Frank Wolf.Over  years later and supported with modern-day kit from outdoor specialists Tiso, the explorers are hard at work preparing for the physical and mental challenge of hauling kg sledges for nine hours daily and for up to  consecutive days.Their route will cover undulating, windswept tundra, river valleys and sea ice during what can be the coldest time of year.The Arctic expedition will finish once the four explorers have finally reached Gjoa Haven on King William Island.Mr Smith said: #The Arctic Return expedition will be extremely tough but ultimately our aim is to raise awareness fo the exploits of John Rae and to help restore his rightful place as one of the greatest Scottish explorers in history. It is also our hope that this awareness will inspire the public to support fundraising efforts by the John Rae Society, to restore Rae#s birthplace at the Hall of Clestrain in Oprhir.The team have said any addition funds raised are to be used to produce a documentary film and book about the le and exploits of Rae, the expedition and the history communities, culture and wildle of the Arctic.The public will be able to track the team#s progress at their official website and through social media.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Mr McArthur believes this reflects a change in approach by the government, after months of campaigning by the Orkney MSP and a range of organisations involved in tackling fuel poverty across the Highlands and Islands.During his remarks, Mr McArthur pointed out that when it comes to fuel poverty, rural and island areas are disproportionately affected, with Orkney having the highest proportion of households in fuel poverty and extreme fuel poverty anywhere in Scotland.Commenting after the debate, Mr McArthur said: “Fuel poverty blights communities across Scotland, but there is no doubt that it has a disproportionate impact on rural and island areas. Until recently, however, the Scottish Government appeared unwilling to recognise this fact or indeed the higher costs faced by those living in our rural and island communities.“Over recent months, working with a range of organisations with a wealth of experience and expertise in tackling fuel poverty, I have made the case for the Minister, Kevin Stewart to think again.  It was a case that the Local Government Committee was also persuaded to support.“I am delighted, therefore, that the Minister has had a change of heart and committed to bring forward amendments to his bill at stage two that better reflect the specic nature of fuel poverty in places like Orkney.  I look forward to seeing the detail of those amendments and will work with Mr Stewart, and local stakeholders in Orkney, to make sure we get this right.“Given the impact fuel poverty can have, not just on people’s quality of le but their physical and mental health, this bill has the potential to make a real dference.  For that to happen, it must be both effective and ambitious in eradicating fuel poverty from communities across the country.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We will be looking to strengthen the Bill as it progresses through the Scottish Parliament and ensuring that the Scottish Governmentrsquos pledges are met.\"Before Wednesdayrsquos debate Mr Stewart said: ldquoWithin this ground-breaking legislation, not only are we one of the few countries in the world to define fuel poverty, we are also setting a goal towards eradicating it.ldquoBy changing the definition of fuel poverty so itrsquos more closely aligned to relative income poverty and taking steps to ensure it works for remote rural and island communities, we are ensuring our support is focussed on those who need it most.\"He added: \"In this day and age, it is unacceptable that any Scottish household should have to choose between having the heating on and cooking their dinner.Councillor Ian Cockburn, who represents the Wester Ross, Strathpeffer and Lochalsh welcomed the Bill as \"something has to be done about fuel poverty\" while arguing it is also time to rethink infrastructure like the national grid.\"It is ambitious but has to be tried to get fuel poverty down in rural areas. We are one of the most energy rich countries in the world so we should be able to get something done. Too many people take it as just being part of the landscape up here so we need to change that thinking as well to get people the assistance that they need.\"Scotland should not be in this state. But you have to look back, the National Grid was set up at the end of the war, the Highlands is considered off-grid despite supplying much of the rest of the country through hydro and wind power. It is time for a rethink.\"Calum Macaulay, chief executive of Invergordon-based Albyn Housing Society, said: ldquoWe welcome this development in the Scottish Governmentrsquos approach to addressing fuel poverty in rural areas. The push to include minimum income standards feels like a signicant step forwards. This is something that the Rural and Islands Housing Association Forum has been promoting for quite some time.\"This has included research undertaken with the support of Highlands and Islands Enterprise and others into minimum income standards in rural communities. The results of this highlighted the pressures of lower average household incomes and higher average fuel costs across the northern parts of Scotland.\"What do you think  Share your views by emailing newsdesk@spp-groupMonday  Feb  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The annual Franco-Scottish Society Alexander Gray Fund Lecture in Inverness on Friday promises to be alight-hearted bilingual talk from Ms Walker and her \"long-suffering\" Parisian translator Richard Kausch.Major Tomrsquos War is a moving novel set in France during the First World War, in part in the grim lsquozones occupeacuteesrsquo of northern France.Its characters are real people ndash and both author and translator have had to enter the minds of the novelrsquos key protagonists.The novel is published in English by Kashi House in London and the French edition should follow late this year or early in .Veeand Richard will be touring four of the regional Franco-Scottish Societies of Scotland this month.The groups exist to foster French language and culture in Scotland and meet monthly for French conversation or a lecture.Those who come along are welcome to join or to attend as a non-member.

If the facility is not taken on by the community then it will close on March as per report to the Highland Council [on] October .ldquoNo survey will be undertaken, the facility will transfer in lsquoas seen, as isrsquo condition, the facilities will transfer in their current operational condition. The position of toilets remaining open whilst negotiations are ongoing is for this financial year only. There is no budget to retain facilities... which is why we want to get the leases sorted out before the end of March.Despite that the director of the Groam House Museum Doug Maclean, who recently attended a meeting of the community council where the future of the toilets was on the agenda remains hopeful.ldquoWe are confident that by some means or other, through a charitable trust taking over the running of the toilets and the good services of the local people, we will be able to keep the toilets open, he said.However, Mr Maclean was in no doubt about how serious an effect the closure would have on Rosemarkie as well as Groam House Museum.ldquoFrom the museumrsquos point of view it is absolutely vital for our existence. We have groups of school children that come here and of course children need to go to the toilet, he said.ldquoWe also have groups of mainly elderly American tourists and they are not in a position to make their way to the beach cafeacute. And we would lose both those groups without the toilets which put the museum in jeopardy.Black Isle ward councillor Gordon Adam said: ldquoI am in discussions with the council over the time limit of March , my view is that the council needs to be flexible. Savings have to be made, but sticking rigidly to a timetable leaves little time to form development groups.Monday  Feb  : AMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

There are many reasons why this course of action is necessary, the main one being the struggle to secure sufficient finances to run the organisation.About pound, to pound, is needed annually but Ms Cochrane said that the NHS is doing a review of third sector input, and can only confirm funding up to June.Without the support of the NHS, they will find it dficult to win the support of other funding bodies.The news will be a blow to the  service users currently on the books of ACSRS many of whom faced a personal battle before seeking help and then keeping on attending to receive the support on offer.However Ms Cochrane said they will do everything in their power to ensure their clients receive alternative assistance with their dependency. Around  people with alcohol dependency are referred to them each year.She said: ldquoThe board is actively pursuing alternative arrangements for our service users and volunteer counsellors who wish to continue their support or volunteering.ldquoACSRS has been indebted to many people over the years who have given their time and expertise freely as volunteers. Some have assisted in the management of the service as board members providing governance and support for staff and volunteers.ldquoOthers have given thousands of hours of their free time as trained volunteer counsellors. There are six counsellors and not all of them will be wanting to move on though some might seek paid employment.ldquoThe training for these counsellors was previously provided free. It now requires a source of additional funding.ldquoAs for other voluntary organisations, the burden of bureaucracy has increased without the corresponding increase in income, and the task of securing additional funding has become more challenging.ldquoACSRS is the only voluntary organisation within Ross-shire and Sutherland offering a free professional one-to-one counselling service for those affected by their own or a loved onersquos addiction. Our work complements the work done by NHS Drug and Alcohol Recovery staff.ldquoWe would like to thank all those people for their extremely valuable contributions which made it possible for us to serve our community for over  years.Councillor Margaret Paterson, Dingwall and Seaforth, said: ldquoI know this group and this will be a dreadful loss as they give a tremendous service. It is quite distressing to hear this because they have given people with addiction and their families such help for so many years. Their volunteers have given such time and talent to help the vulnerable in society, butthey donrsquot have money then they just canrsquot do it.

There is a long way to go for it to be anything like it.For one thing there are, as yet, no Scottish or Welsh MPs involved, it is not a British political phenomenon but a peculiarly English affair.Secondly there are, thus far, no big hitters involved. This is the defection of some colourful rent-a-quote self-publicists but no current or former cabinet secretaries have yet joined in the stampede that became a trickle.When the Social Democratic Party was established in  by a break away from the Labour Party, the ringleaders were all seasoned former Cabinet members of stature and reputation beloved by BBC producers. Roy Jenkins had been Home Secretary, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and President of the European CommissionDavid Owen had been Foreign Secretary Shirley Williams Education Secretary and Bill Rodgers Transport secretary. They attracted  other Labour MPs and one Conservative, including three Welsh and two Scottish MPs. No one could doubt it was a British political force and that it carried serious government experience and intellectual heft.Today’s independent group enjoys no such reputation, but instead is characterised by politicians who originally stood for election in  on manesto commitments to respect the EU referendum result and deliver a Brexit that meant leaving the Single Market and Customs Union. They have been betraying those pledges without a blush of embarrassment or scintilla of shame pretty much since ing to Westminster.Many were also especially vocerousrejecting calls for a second referendum but now campaign for it as a panacea for all our ills.Thus we have a party-in-waiting claiming for themselves a “centrist” democratic legitimacy yet composed of MPs that have, each and everyone, already betrayed the solemn pledges made to their electorates at the last election – and now wish to overturn the biggest decision taken by voters in the UK since universal suffrage was achieved.Further, the group lacks serious politicians of reputation and proven leadership stature – and is limited in reach only to England. Those are hardly convincing credentials for a new “third force” or what is necessary to “break the mould” and create a realignment where parties more accurately reflect competing policies or philosophies – rather than trying to be all things to all voters, as is the case currently.Nor has the independent group brought a much needed and refreshing honesty to political debate. Instead Anna Soubry launched into invective based on a  analysis alleging the removal of Tory prime ministers by the party’s Eurosceptic right wing the infiltration and takeover of Conservative Party associations pushing for deselections and the Prime Minister being in the clutches of the pro-Brexit European Research Group MPs.Even a quick glance at historical references show Thatcher was removed by her party’s Europhile wing John Major had to resign after losing to Blair following his administration’s ERM-led recession and sleaze scandals while David Cameron broke his promise to stay on after the EU referendum by walking out after losing it at the hands of the British people. There was no right wing putsch on any occasion. Writing on ConservativeHome website Mark Wallace systematically demolished Soubry’s claims about entryism as wholly lacking in evidence, while Theresa May’s premiership is without a doubt the most left-of-centre Tory administration since Harold Macmillan’s sixty years ago.There is an obvious answer to the dead-end that confronts the independent group and that is for the Cabinet’s whingers that are forever threatening to resign from government over leaving without an EU-imposed deal to actually deliver on their threats – but not just to abandon their ministerial positions but their party too. What’s stopping the likes of Amber Rudd, David Gauke, Greg Clarke and Scottish Secretary David Mundell following through to the logical conclusion of their position  There’s not a cigarette paper between them and Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen or Sarah Wollaston. Like Soubry, who previously defected to the SDP in , Mundell left the Conservatives then too and was an SDP councillor until . Is it loyalty to the Tory party or personal satisfaction from holding high office that tells them to continue asministers  Mundell in particular has been here before, threatening to resign last year, then justying remaining in his post, but with his credibility holed below the water line as a result. Of course banging on about leaving without a deal is all rather staged. The government has a deal, it’s just that parliament convincingly voted against it. Were Labour and the SNP to back the EU-May deal it could possibly pass. Despite all the name-calling directed at the Brexiteer Tories the fact that we are still talking about possibly leaving without a deal is entirely down to highly partisan party politics. Meanwhile, the Conservative loyalists in the European Reform Group – showing loyalty to their party’s manesto they were elected on – have repeatedly sought ways to deliver a deal. The latest, a new version of the “Malthouse Compromise” tries to help the Prime Minister in her negotiations and ensure that even leaving without a deal can be achieved with goodwill on all sides. By comparison, were Rudd, Mundell and their fellow murmurers, to stop crying wolf and join the independent group then we would at least get the realignment and formation of a true centrist party that many Blairites, Liberal Democrats and Tory Wets keep signalling should come about, but never quite arrives.It would of course mean the collapse of the government, it would mean a general election and it would mean the Conservatives, Labour, and the Independent Group together with the Liberal Democrats, having to realign into three more coherent groups. They would need distinctly dferent offerings and be absolutely honest this time about what they would do about Brexit – as well as the economy, the housing shortage, benefit reforms and all the other issues that really matter to people.They would need to saythey would have another EU referendum and demonstrate they would keep their word this time – and similarly state how they would treat demands for a second Scottish referendum too.

For a third time, the chance to vote on the shape of Brexit is postponed.The PM insists that a vote will take place on March  - little more than a fortnight before the nation is due to depart the EU. We are bound to say that the last minute nature of such a vote will render it, in our view, meaningless.The time for Mrs May to stand-up, in the interests of the country, to the hardline Conservative Brexiteers who would gladly see us crash out of Europe without a deal is now long past. She should make clear that, regardless of their protestations, she is not willing to countenance a No Deal Brexit.Despite the career-long Euroscepticism of Jeremy Corbyn, Labour is now warming to the idea of a second referendum. Greater urgency from the opposition would be welcomed.The promises made by the Leave campaign during the  referendum campaign have collided, hard, with reality and the result is that we can see clearly just how complex the process of Brexit is. Furthermore, we are able now to see that leaving the EU without any kind of agreement would be desperately damaging to the UK. Those who scream loudest for Brexit whatever the cost would, we have no doubt, react furiously to any delay to the UK’s departure from the EU. Their zealotry should have no bearing on the PM’s thinking.Instead, Mrs May must put the country before the right-wing of her party and apply the brakes.Regardless of their positions on the European question, it is incumbent upon political leaders - across the spectrum - to ensure that departure from the EU causes the least possible damage to the British economy and to our way of le.

Instead Theresa May#s unilateral decision to shunt this week#s meaningful vote to the very brink of Brexit was delivered yesterday in the snug surroundings of a jet bound for Egypt. Nice.Theresa May’s casual rearrangement of an agreed schedule is disappointing, duplicitous, disruptive and unreliable. But who cares  Bad faith is seen as a slightly regretted but absolutely inevitable part of our “robust” political process.Maybe though, it highlights something important but generally missed. The electorate has allowed Britain’s political class to act like spoilt brats for far too long.Most ordinary members of the public possess a basic courtesy, sense of fairness, ability to empathise and willingness to listen. Yet these traits are found nowhere in the behaviour of Government or indeed the vascillating opposition. So who is more likely to find a resolution to the current Brexit crisis -- axe-grinding politicians or fair-minded citizens  That question was debated this weekend by lawyers, activists and academics at a conference entitled, “Remaking the UK Constitution” in Oxford. Many speakers expressed the hope that an extension to Brexit might buy the time and political space needed to build faith in and pressure for a novel democratic solution -- handing the whole sorry mess back to citizens’ assemblies.The concept is unfamiliar in Scotland and may sound home-spun or just plain whacky. But the Irish and Canadians can testy that well-facilitated groups of randomly chosen citizens have found popular solutions to thorny problems – and have conferred upon them a sense of civic legitimacy, generally absent in the formal political arena.In Dublin during , a Constitutional Convention met eight times to produce outline legislation on equal marriage. It echoed the public mood so well, that the proposal got  per cent backing at the referendum two years later. In  another randomly selected Citizens Assembly recommended a referendum on removing the eighth amendment of the Constitution, which banned abortion in almost all circumstances.Despite fears the Citizens Assembly had gone too far, . per cent of the population backed its proposal, proving that ordinary voters can successfully resolve issues, which have been absolutely intractable for politicians. The  Assembly members were chosen at random to reflect the Irish population in terms of age, gender, social class and geography. They included pro-lers, pro-choicers and undecideds and heard from people on both sides of the abortion debate, including medical, legal and ethical specialists, and people giving personal testimonies. Members had the chance to discuss amongst themselves, to listen and reflect on the views of others on  weekends, over  months between November  and April .The technique has unquestionably worked in Ireland. Could it work here In January, the campaign group Compasscalled for a citizens’ assembly with  representative members of the public picked at random to hear evidence, produce recommendations and break the Brexit deadlock. Labour MPs Stella Creasy and Lisa Nandy picked up the idea and tabled an amendment to Theresa May’s deal suggesting citizens assemblies could disrupt the bad habits of Brexit which include “kicking issues into the long grass, placing party interests over the national interest and assuming the public are unable to cope with hard choices.” But the idea got very little coverage, only  MP signatures, and some criticism from CA believers worried that the mandate was too narrow to tackle the massive social and constitutional problems underpinning Brexit, the timescale far too short and that a citizens’ assembly held under these circumstances, without genuine Government buy-in could easily become emergency elastoplast for a near terminal political condition. So the Creasy Nandy amendment fell last month - but now, with an extension of Article  now looking fairly likely, it could be resurrected – given time and cross party goodwill.This latter commodity however is in very short supply at Westminster – an institution so stuck in its ways and mired in such uncritical self belief that MPs seem unlikely to admit their own inept custodianship of British democracy has helped drive the Brexit vote and drive away any reasonable resolution. So citizens’ assemblies may have their first substantial UK outing north of the border instead.Last summer the SNP held four National Assemblies which let members think through issues including the vexed question of the currency to be used in an independent Scotland. The gatherings weren’t properly resourced, randomly selected and didn’t meet long enough to hear and debate evidence from a wide range of experts. But it was a start.In December, Professor Alan Miller, who chairs the First Minister’s Advisory Group on Human Rights Leadership took things further. He published a report about safeguarding human rights in Scotland post Brexit. The report’s second recommendation is, “A public participatory process as a vital part of preparation for and implementation of an Act of the Scottish Parliament providing human rights leadership.” In other words, the Scottish Government,it accepts the recommendations, could soon create the first Citizens’ Assembly in Britain to tackle a really substantial issue – developing a devolved human rights framework ora written constitution including a Bill of Rights. This prospect is causing a flutter amongst academics and campaigners south of the border. At the Oxford conference, many speakers openly encouraged Scotland to pioneer citizens’ assmeblies for the whole UK - others exhorted a swt move towards a second independence referendum as the only event catalcysmic enough to waken up the English political class.SNP members including Joanna Cherry MP will propose a summer of properly funded and randomly selected citizens juries at the SNP’s April conference, to bring together Yes, No and undecided voters to create their own vision of a new Scotland – tackling every relevant constitutional question from the voting system to the currency.The Edinburgh MSP tweeted yesterday “If Article  is extended, the SNP could use the time to build consensus, and use Citizens Assemblies to answer the big policy questions.”Is that likely  Successive Holyrood governments have created a substantial consultation culture – but handing voters the power to frame solutions would open up a whole new energising democratic dimension.

It is a safe bet that there are only three: Robert Somerville, John Keenan, and Bob Fulton.Back in March , when they were union shop stewards at the town#s Rolls Royce plant, the three men # and thousands of their co-workers # were responsible for virtually grounding the air force of Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who had seized power just a few months before in a savage CIA-backed coup. The documentary #Nae Pasaran#, screened in Portree last weekend, tells the story of how these principled trade unionists came to be awarded the highest honour the Republic of Chile can bestow upon foreigners.With much of the world appalled by the overthrow, in September , of the democratically-elected socialist Government of Salvador Allende, it fell to Bob Fulton # a burly, no-nonsense Christian with wartime experience of fighting fascist dictators # to set the ball rolling in East Kilbride. Arriving for work on the morning of th March  he uncovered a chilling truth about the eight Rolls Royce jet engines that had just been delivered to the plant for servicing: the engines came from the British Hawker Hunter jets used by Pinochet loyalists to bomb, amongst other targets, the presidential palace in Santiago where Allende died on the day the coup began.Now in his mid-s, Bob immediately #blacked# the engines that is, he declared them subject to an industrial dispute. As such, they could not be touched by any worker # or anyone , for that matter # until the dispute was resolved. His colleagues soon followed suit, much to the consternation of management and the UK Government. And so the engines sat, untouched, out in the open air for the next four years, until they became useless lumps of rusting metal. Moreover, the East Kilbride plant was the only place in the world licensed to service the engines. So, aside from the eight now-engineless jets, the rest of Pinochet#s air force could not be kept airworthy while workers thousands of miles away stuck to the principles of international solidarity. How many lives this saved on the ground is a moot point.#Nae Pasaran# is a paean to what can be achieved by collective action, and to what might be described as the golden age of trade unionism. But the documentary # written and directed by Felipe Bustos Sierra, son of an exiled Chilean journalist # also works as an emotionally-charged voyage of discovery.For over  years, Bob, John and Robert, and other former plant workers doubted whether or not their actions had any lasting effect on the lives of persecuted Chileans, many of whom were trade unionists like themselves. #Nae Pasaran# works in a dramatic sense because we watch as this gap in their knowledge is filled. The Scottish refuseniks did make an impact. Their stand mattered.What makes #Nae Pasaran# so moving is that the surviving union men, interviewed atby Sierra in his adopted homeland, are shown interviews he conducted back in Chile with survivors of Pinochet#s brutality. Now old men themselves, the victims recalled how they took solace in smuggled radios tuned to Radio Moscow, which broadcast regular updates on the Scottish union#s boycott. The action # or rather inaction # of the Rolls Royce workers gave many Chileans hope that they would not be forgotten or abandoned by the outside world. It may even have contributed directly to the saving of seven lives.Among the hundreds of Chilean exiles arriving in the UK were seven rumoured to have escaped execution or imprisonment because the air force acquired spare parts from Israel, South Africa, and India. So desperate were the Chilean authorities for this materiel they may have swapped the seven detainees for what they needed. Sierra never proves this conclusively, however, because the UK Home Office refused to release certain files relating to the boycott.And what of the jet engines, left to rust in East Kilbride  They were whisked away early one morning in . To this day no one knows who took them, but the Rolls Royce workers were told they were back in service with the Chilean air force. A year later Margaret Thatcher came to power and relations with the Pinochet regime were quickly normalised. Arms exports resumed in earnest.But the #blacked# engines were never used again. One of them, which Sierra discovered in a derelict yard outside Santiago, was shipped back to Scotland in , the year before #Nae Pasaran# hit the cinemas. It is due to be installed, as a lasting monument to the boycott, in a college campus in East Kilbride in the very near future.#Nae Pasaran# celebrates people power. After the screening, the topic was the subject of a short talk by Councillor Chris McEleny, leader of the SNP Group on Inverclyde Council, who also answered questions from the audience on British involvement in the destruction of Yemen, the desire by Tory Brexiteers to deregulate and deunionise even further, and the situation in Venezuela. Indeed, Mr McEleny drew an #obvious parallel# with Venezuela, where the democratically-elected socialist Government of another resource-rich South American country is being targeted for regime change.He said: #In Chile, before the coup, US corporations had huge commercial interests in copper mining and they sought to undermine and destabilise the Allende Government, and this is pretty much what we are seeing in Venezuela right now. Poverty in Venezuela has been engineered by the US, just as it was in Chile. We are seeing the same media pattern, a capitalist conditioning programmeyou like, drip-feeding propaganda to make intervention look like the right thing to do. We are seeing that right now with Venezuela so we need to see the same solidarity that Bob Fulton and others showed in the s.#Sadly, as Bob and his comrades lamented, in an era of weakened trade unions such a workplace boycott could probably not take place now. Those responsible would be handed their Ps."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2108-21-September-12-150x150.jpg","title":"new skye gallery to bring celebrated artists studio back into","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe former studio of the late, much-loved and acclaimed artist Tommy MacKenzie was reopened as a new gallery space in Skye this week by a local businessman.Robert MacAskill, owner of the Relish Deli in Wentworth Street, Portree took on the studio following the passing of Mr MacKenzie in March last year and has decided to open it as the ‘Isle of Skye Gallery’, maintaining the space’s connection to the rich arts legacy set in place by the former Glasgow Print Studio member.Born in Shetland in , Tommy MacKenzie moved to Portree a year later and, after attending the local high school, he went on to study at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design in Dundee. In  he was accepted into the prestigious Hornsey School of Art, where he made his mark in etching and printmaking with his graduation piece ‘At the Ebb’ being selected for exhibition in the Royal Academy Summer Show.After further enhancing his reputation and craft as a member of the Glasgow Print Studio, which he joined in the mid-s, Tommy ed to Portree in  and founded Skye Original Prints.A combination of gallery and workshop # that drew in many visitors- the space also provided a base for the printmaker to create works which he would go on to sell around the world.With the Isle of Skye Gallery opened this week, the former creative hub of the celebrated Sgitheanach artist could act as an exciting  for current talent on the island.. “It just needed a wee bit of decorating really. I think it is a good space for local artists and photographers to show their work.”As well as welcoming new artists, the gallery’s ties to Tommy will also remain intact through a connection with one of his siblings, as Robert explained.“Tommy’s brother Rory has some work in the gallery – which is quite a nice connection,” Robert said. “He does landscapes – mostly small works which are water-based.“He heard I was renovating the gallery and gave me a call – I had no idea he painted, and I was delighted when he phoned up and asked.”The Portree businessman added: “I have about a dozen dferent artists and photographers – six of which are showing work at the gallery already. Jeremy Rossiter is one, he was the first person I spoke to.“I also have work from a couple from Skeabost, Gill Williams, who is a photographer, and her husband Ian Williams – who is more of an abstract painter.“What I like might or might not be what other people like, so I am intrigued to see how things go.”Robert said that he planned to open the gallery through to at least October and would operate on a commission basis, giving the artists the freedom to price the work themselves.He added: “A lot of galleries just focus on professional artists, but I want it to also be a place where amateur artists and photographers can sell their work.”He went on to say: “When people are buying something, especially work that’s expensive, it’s better to see it in the flesh than on a computer. It’s a  for people to sell their work, and I am just acting as an agent, selling it for them and supplying the location.”He added: “We are calling it the Isle of Skye Gallery – keeping it simple. That way everyone knows where it is, and it doesn’t prioritise one type of artwork over another. We have a Facebook page — Isle of Skye Gallery, and we’re on Instagram too — it’s not my forte but it’s a good  to promote it.” that while the gallery was due to open this week, an official launch would take place next month.With th March marking the one-year anniversary of Tommy’s death, perhaps the new crop of artists present will draw inspiration from the indelible impression left by the gallery’s former incumbent as the space is brought back into use."},{"url":null,"title":"m22 closure after four vehicles in collision","story":"The M northbound is closed between the Ballygrooby Road and Moneynick Road junctions after a collision involving four vehicles on Friday night.

As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award. At a business level, I’ve been very proud to see Ballymena evolve to become a Centre of Excellence, focused on driving innovation in food manufacturing. “As General Manager, it’s my ambition to see our facilities continue to grow.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1460456.jpg--.jpg?1550570314000\n","title":"mp hails amber light on scotland bridge plan","story":"North Antrim MP Ian Paisley has welcomed talks about a prospective bridge connecting Northern Ireland and Great Britain.Mr Paisley recently, along with South Antrim DUP MP Paul Girvan met with the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling to discuss the bridge.After the meeting between the three MPs, the Transport secretary said he would be in contact with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in order to discuss a feasibility project which would investigate the economics of the bridge and whether it would make financial sence to construct the bridge.The proposed bridge could be placed anywhere along the Northern Irish coast line, either at the shortest distance to Scotland at  miles or at the longest of  miles.

And so we’d pull on the new gutties, lace them up with loving care and outside we’d go for a race.The winner was never going to be the fastest runner – the winner was going to be the one with the fastest shoes. We’d line up out in the square and, after the usual fussing and fighting over  starts and wrong counts, off we’d bolt, feeling aswe were being powered by some unseen but powerful motor in our pristine new gutties. Then we’d do some jumps, because of course those new gutties could not only make you run like the wind, they could make you leap like an antelope.Squinter’s not sure that kids do that now with their £-plus gel-cushioned, gas-injected fashion statements. In fact, he’s fairly sure that by the time a child grows out of them they’re as unmarked as the day they left the factory, given that they’ve spent more time on a sofa than they have on the street.Squinter’s running days are most likely over, sad to relate , which means that he will never again appreciate the unalloyed joyof pulling on a new pair of trainers. He did buy a sturdy pair of brogues recently which will face up to the rigours of any Belfast winter, but sadly aren’t designed to propel a person along a flat tarmac surface at any appreciable speed not like a good pair of Sizzlers."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"irsp claim psni are intimidating families","story":"AN IRSP member who says he is followed by the PSNI daily has accused police of attempting to “intimidate” party activists.Lower Falls man Michael Kelly was one of a number of IRSP members who were searched by the PSNI as they arrived for a meeting at Costello House earlier thismonth.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Mr Kelly reiterated his parties claims that PSNI are involved in “political policing”, and accused police of harassing party members and their families.“I have been getting stalked – it’s every day,” he said.“There are days when it’s worse than others, but there are comrades who get it far worse than myself.“We have a member in St James’ and the cops have a patrol outside his house every morning when he is going to work and bringing kids to school. When he comes back there will be another jeep sitting there or another car sitting there, sometimes marked sometimes unmarked.“This week he was going to get his child from a school event and they stopped him. He pleaded his case that he was running late to pick up his kids and the PSNI boot-boys told him he would stay as long as they ‘saw fit’.“A few weeks ago, I went to pick my son up and I was pulled over and the man said ‘are you in a hurry, Mr Kelly ’ I said I had to pick up my son and told him to get on with whatever he was doing. Again they said ‘you’ll be here as long as we want’. I was there for about ten minutes and I was late to pick up my son.“It’s not just political activists who experience what this brings, it’s also our families – our kids and our partners. Our partners are being intimidated. Two years ago I was approached by MI on the Grosvenor and they followed my partner as she was bringing my daughter to crèche.“The try to intimidate our family members when we’re not there. It’s clear that the ‘reformed’ police service, as they are called by those who work alongside them, are only accommodating to those who tow the line of the establishment. Those who stand in opposition to the British police force in Ireland are fair game, and that also extends to our families.”He continued: “It’s no coincidence that this attempt at criminalising the republican socialist movement, it is starting to rise again when our party is starting to grow and we are doing fantastic work in Belfast.“It will fail today as it has done over the  years of the existence of our party. It will continue to be rejected by those on the ground who we work on behalf of.”The Andersonstown News has contacted the PSNI over the IRSP’s claims and is awaiting a response."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"kfc footage proves man didnt burgle home claim","story":"THE brother of a man who’s been remanded in prison for his alleged involvement in an aggravated burglary in Ligoniel on Friday night says he is innocent.Daniel Lundy says his brother Alan was targeted in an MI-directed operation by the PSNI. He’s currently in Maghaberry. Alan Lundy, of Thornberry Close, appeared before Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday charged with intent to steal and having a firearm. He is accused of being one of two masked men who forced their way into a house on the Ligoniel Road on Friday night where a suspected gun was brandished.However, defence solicitor Darragh Mackin said Alan has provided a detailed account of his whereabouts on the night in question, ranging from being in a KFC fast food outlet  miles away from the scene of the crime,then travelling home and accessing WhatsApp and Facebook. Mr Mackin told the court that cell-site analysis and wi account details can be provided to show Lundy was messaging on social media rather than taking part in any burglary and said it was a “fundamental case of mistaken identity”. District Judge Fiona Bagnall refused Mr Lundy bail, citing potential witness interference and he was remanded in custody to appear by video-link on March .Alan’s partner’s house was raided late on Friday where he was arrested in front of his young children.Alan’s brother Daniel told the North Belfast News that he is innocent and his arrest and remand is the latest in a long list of intimidation against his sibling.“Alan is innocent, it is just internment,” he said.“There is sufficient evidence to prove where he was at the time of this so-called incident.“He is constantly stopped and searched and harassed. His family know where he was and everyone knows where he was.“Alan’s partner’s house was searched and has been on numerous occasions with the doors put through and his kids literally dragged from their bed at all hours of the morning. This is nothing but MI-directed.”North Belfast Saoradh representative Dee Fennell says Alan is “a victim of the state”.“Evidence has already been presented to the Magistrates Court when it was alleged he was involved in an incident in Ligoniel that he was  miles away in a fast food outlet and there is CCTV to prove that,” he said. “There is also proof via his phone that he was not there. There were also conflicting witness reports – one said it was Alan wearing a beige coat and the other said it was Marty wearing a black coat.“In any other situation, Alan would be at home with his family and children but instead he was remanded and sent to Maghaberry. This is the second time Alan has been a victim of malicious prosecution and internment.“In , Alan was a steward at a GARC protest and was accused by a PSNI officer of throwing a stone. He was sent to Maghaberry and served three months and it was only then that the PSNI officer retracted the evidence. His family is constantly harassed on a regular basis and, in my view, Alan is a victim of the state.“In the last ten years, Alan has been arrested between  and  times, had his house raided on more occasions than that, stopped and searched hundreds of time.“I am a youth worker. There are four definitions of abuse: physical, psychological, sexual and neglect. No-one can tell me that Alan Lundy’s children being dragged out of their beds in the middle of the night is not psychological abuse of children.“Alan Lundy personies what is happening to republicans across the six counties. It should also be pointed out that Alan has never been convicted of anything under what the British government callthe Terrorism Act.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Screen-Shot-2019-02-22-at-14.19.53.png","title":"that battered can is kicked again","story":"IN  the intense focus of many in the policing debates in our community was the lack of progress on legacy matters. It was deeply contentious that a new police service could be established without a wider societal process to deal with the harms of the conflict, especially violations by the RUC, including their involvement in collusion and their involvement in and cover-up of state killings.Many families took the view that policing was needed in the community and that the structures were there to make human rights-compliant day-to-day policing possible, but did not agree with the moves to engage in policing in the absence of a process to deal with the past.We all know that the path of a peace process is painful, the question is, what pain is expected from whom Victims affected by all actors have been asked to accept painful processes. Those affected by non-state actors were asked to accept the early release of prisoners.For victims of the state this was not relevant because those responsible benefited from impunity.While the RUC was disbanded their positive reputation in their own community and wider society was secured with a St George’s Cross presented by the queen of England. The costs of changing the RUC to the PSNI ran into tens of millions with severance packages available to those who served in the RUC who did not want to change to PSNI. Those former officers also received pensions. Some of them also came into the PSNI as “civilian staff”.The thing about all of that was that it was never made clear why the change was necessary. It was alluded to as an issue of “community confidence”, because the RUC had been  per cent Protestant. But, of course, that did not explain the need for a human rights-based approach to the PSNI, for multiple s of accountability, including a Policing Board, a Police Ombudsman’s office and formal community engagement structures.Because we had not had an honest accounting for our conflict and impunity reigns supreme, the crimes of the RUC, which include extensive collusion with loyalism, have gone unmentioned and without proper investigation, with the can of dealing with the past being kicked so repeatedly down the road that it has become a sick joke.When George Hamilton became Chief Constable he made promising and assuring statements about the need for a comprehensive process to deal with the past. However, last year when proposals to do exactly that were published the organisation representing his own rank and file rejected them, because of reputational issues for the RUC.Last week’s focus on files not disclosed to the Ombudsman have led to a wider discussion about policing structures. However, despite international and domestic law being on their side, the very people who have been harmed yet again by these systemic and deliberate failures are those whose concerns, for the best will in the world, were sidelined in favour of wider political “progress”.The question is, will those same families, or any other families, ever see their rights being vindicated in a truly independent process  Is it conceivable that they would once again be asked to compromise in favour of wider processes  The anger we all feel this week should be remembered for those days when those questions are asked."},{"url":null,"title":"call for change in law to help parents cope with work and sick newborns","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He weighed just lb oz and was in hospital for six months. At one point his parents were told he may not survive.Over five years on Ollie is thriving, but Lynette says giving him the extra time he needed at home meant tough choices for the family.A survey of  parents across the UK by the charity Bliss found that one in  parents with sick or premature babies had to quit their jobs, and three-quarters felt they didnt have enough time off.Over a third of fathers also resorted to being signed off sick to spend time with their babies in neonatal care.Backed by the charity Tiny Le, Bliss is calling for extended periods of maternity pay and paternity leave.\"It was a very bumpy ride for Ollie and a very tough journey for us,\" said Mrs McIlroy.The initial expense came from daily travel between Lisburn to the neonatal unit in Belfast.\"My husband had to work as there was only one wage coming in.\"She made the journey to hospital again each evening with her husband, with food increasing the cost.When Ollie ed home, Mrs McIlroy had only three months of maternity pay left.\"I felt I didnt have as much time to bond with Ollie so I took an extra three months unpaid,\" she said. \"My husbands employer was quite good - his paternity had lapsed by the time Ollie came home but they still honoured his two weeks of leave. That definitely wouldnt be the case for most fathers.\"Thankfully Ollie is thriving now, I think its because of the quality time we have been able to give him by me taking that extra three months at my own expense.\"Alison McNulty, chief executive of Tiny Le, said: \"Many of our parents here would be experiencing problems at a time when maternity pay goes down to the statutory maternity allowance of £ a week. But the average cost of living when you have a baby in a neonatal unit is around £ a week. So you can see how quickly parents struggle financially. Theres also the issues of attachment and bonding which are crucial to both the childs development and the parents mental health.\"Ms McNulty said a motion by Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong to increase statutory maternity pay is \"ready for our Executive - but thats not going anywhere until Stormont s\".She added: \"Paternity pay is a matter for the Treasury, so were asking parents to write letters to their MPs to become involved in the campaign.\"For information visit www.tinyle.org.uk or www.bliss.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"eu cannot compromise on brexit deal to placate conservative brexiteers","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We were the only people who werent Press or part of the project.\"She added: \"One of the personal security men came over and told me where to stand and said he was quite sure that Meghan would want to talk to the girls. And, thankfully, as soon as she came out she actually came running towards them.\"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were in Asni as part of a three-day visit to Morocco to learn about the Moroccan NGO Education For All, founded by British entrepreneur Michael McHugo.Meghan had a floral pattern painted on her left hand and wrist for good luck during her visit to the Atlas mountains project where girls are given a chance to fulfil their potential by having a secondary education. Meghan, who is seven months pregnant, was dressed in a black top, skinny jeans and velvet Birdies slippers, opting for a casual look, wearing her hair down and keeping her makeup to a minimum. But, as far as the girls were concerned, there was a very signicant item missing from her wardrobe... as their laughing mother explained.\"They wanted to know where her crown was and why she wasnt wearing it,\" Dr McCaughey said.\"They were disappointed, but I told them she had to leave it at home because she came in a helicopter and it might have fallen out of the helicopter on the way.\"Dr McCaughey got chatting to Meghan as well.\"It was lovely,\" she said. \"I was prompting the girls to look at her painted henna hand and we were all wishing her well with the forthcoming arrival of her baby.\"They are a lovely couple and it was wonderful for them to take the time and come over to talk to us. The girls had been waiting around for some time in the sunshine so it really made their day.

I has been an honour and privilege to work alongside such committed and hardworking councillors. “Being a councillor is by no means an easy role but it is definitely one of the most rewarding jobs you can do. I can still remember the feeling I felt the first time I was able to help a young women get a house. I feel the exact same today when someone approaches me for help and in turn, doing all I can to assist them in whatever issue it may be, however dficult and seeing it through to the end by getting a result, means so much to me. googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Over my time on Council I have dealt with so many dferent issues on behalf of the party from the need for a report into detox services, highlighting the failings of Welfare Reform and tackling anti-social behaviour.

I currently chair the Bonfire working group and I sit on a number of bodies and council working groups on behalf of the SDLP.“For me being a Councillor is in many ways a dual role. Yes, the work within the council chamber is important but equally the work in your community is as,not, more important. It’s that work and contact with constituents that informs your work within the chamber.“I will continue to work to build a stronger community infrastructure where residents of all ages can come and meet and engage with their neighbours. Therefore, when the Galliagh Community Centre, who I have worked alongside for a number of years, got the green light from planners a few months ago, I was delighted. It may surprise you but Galliagh, for its size, has never had a community centre. We have lots of community groups either taking up Housing Executive houses or flats which are badly needed within the area. I hope to see work start on the Galliagh Community Centre at the end of this year. Which will see £. million of investment pumped into the area. I have been working on a similar project in Shantallow where the current centre is almost  years old and l hope to see work start in the early summer on this £. Million project. I will continue to push for the re-development of Templemore Sports Complex and the dualing of the Buncranna Road which I hope will kick-start the much needed development at Arntz.“I am committed to continuing to help and assist people with social housing applications and benefit enquiries. Our area has seen a number of housing developments build in Skeoge over the last number of years and only last week seen another  houses approved by planners. However building houses isn’t building communities without the proper community Infrastructure. I have been lobbing Housing associations to build proper communities. Now after + years we are catching up with community Infrastructure in Galliagh and I don’t want to see the same mistakes repeated in Skeoge.\"Cllr Tierney concluded: “I am looking forward to an enjoyable campaign over the next few months and hope that the work I have been involved in over the last council term will stand me in good stead come May nd.\""},{"url":null,"title":"waiting bus shelter along comes another one","story":"“As the old saying goes, you wait ages for a bus and then two come along at once now the same can be said for bus shelters in Creggan, Sinn Fein Councillor Kevin Campbell has said.Cllr Campbell “Now I am very pleased that has been quickly followed by the installation of a second shelter at Iniscarn Road.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“These new bus shelters will make le more comfortable for those residents of the area who depend on public transport to get around.

At the start I only worked three hours each day but that has more than doubled in recent years.ldquoMy husband, Raymond, who was chairman of the PTA, and I presented the school with a silver cup in the late s which became known as the Hilman Cup. We present it to the child that has earned the highest overall achievement each year. We are almost running out of space now to engrave names, she laughed.Mrs Hilman, who has become a very familiar face over the years, recalled some of the highlights during her time at Academy Primary.She said: ldquoIn  I had the opportunity to accompany two other long-serving staff members to attend a royal garden party at Hilsborough Castle. I got to speak and shake hands with Prince Charles and it was certainly a very memorable occasion for me.ldquoOf course I will never forget the surprise dinner that the staff had for me at Rockmount Golf Club a few weeks ago. There were  people who attended that evening and they made a big cake for me with lots of candles on it. They wrote and performed a song for me and I was very taken aback by it all.It is obvious that Mrs Hilman has formed quite a strong bond with everyone at the school mdash children and staff alike.She said: ldquoI will miss the children very much indeed. Each child is an inspiration to me, especially the two special needs children. They wave at me as they go home and I find them so sweet and friendly. They are treated the same as all the other children. They inspire me each day to just get up and get on with it.She continued: ldquoI have received terric support from Mr Moore since he first arrived at the school  years ago. My time here has been a very happy one and for that Irsquom very thankful. I have formed some great friendships.Mrs Hilman has plenty to occupy her in her retirement. She confesses she is more of a lsquotidy-upperrsquo around the garden but canrsquot wait to become more involved with planting and creative borders. She also loves to walk and travel.Mrs Hilman has two young grandchildren, Jamesand Aimee , and she says she will be able to spend more time with them, as well as becoming more involved with the Saintfield Womenrsquos Institute. It sounds like she will be busier in retirement than ever.Mr Moore described Mrs Hilman as an institution. ldquoWe would certainly wish Mrs Hilman a very happy retirement with many years of good health to enjoy it, he said.ldquoShe has given us many years of service which can only be described as remarkable. We will miss her very much indeed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Roadworks set to begin on pipeline in Saintfield  ","story":"WORK to bring natural gas to the heart of Saintfield is to start earlier than planned.Phoenix Natural Gas mdash which is investing poundm to extend its expansive network to towns across East Down mdash was due to start work in the townrsquos Main Street area in September.However, contractors will be in the town early next month at the request of roads officials with the work focusing on an area starting at the Fair Green, running through to Station Road via Main Street and Todds Hill. The work is expected to take seven weeks to complete.Contractors are due to begin work in the centre of Saintfield on March  and Rowallane councillor Billy Walker is urging people to be patient during the scheme.Today, between pm and pm, Phoenix officials will be hosting a public information event at the Rowallane Community Hub in Main Street to outline the programme of work and discuss it with residents and the business community.Phoenix says it is making signicant progress on its East Down investment proposal and revealed that Transport NI is managing a number of other construction programmes in surrounding areas which include road closures.Cllr Walker said as a result, Phoenix has been asked to bring forward its work in the town centre to fit in with other planned projects in the area.He also confirmed that the new pipeline programme has been discussed with several community representatives including Saintfield Development Association officials and a representative from Saintfield Traderrsquos Group who had expressed concern aboutthe works taking place in September.While Phoenix admits that the construction programme will ldquoinevitably not be convenient for a number of residents and business owners, it says bringing the work forward by six months will result in the most disruptive set of works being completed by late April or early May, rather than later in the year.Company officials have also visited businesses to outline the nature of the work, with Phoenix undertaking to do all it can during the construction process to accommodate business needs.Officials plan to work closely with the townrsquos Development Association and provide funding for a lsquoshop localrsquo campaign to encourage trade within Saintfield as work on the scheme continues.Residents in the area affected by the pipe laying work have also been informed about the change in the construction timetable.Cllr Walker, who is a keen supporter of bringing natural gas to East Down to provide consumers with an additional element of choice when it comes to their energy supplier, hopes contractors will not encounter any signicant hurdles as they progress along Main Street.ldquoIt is important people remain patient during the latest aspect of the work in Main Street, he said. ldquoAs this is the main route through the heart of the town, disruption will be inevitable.ldquoThe fact that the work programme has been brought forward is positive given that it will be carried out when the days are longer. Hopefully this will mean that the work could potentially be completed sooner than planned.Cllr Walker says Phoenix will hope to use underground drilling where possible and is appealing to people to continue to support local businesses.He added: ldquoThe Saintfield business community is the backbone of the townrsquos economy and provides essential employment. It is important everyone continues to support traders during this scheme..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/7205620.jpg","title":"seans surreal abbey road experience","story":"With his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle in hand, local musician Sean Magee recently recorded a single at the iconic Abbey Road Studios, a place made famous by The Beatles.Calling the experience of recording in the same studio as The Beatles ldquosurreal, Sean explained how the opportunity arose.ldquoIrsquove just recently joined up with a guy called Rory Gallagher, hersquos from Kilcar, Donegal, and his project is called Rory and the Island for he owned the Island Bar over in Lanzarote for five or six years before he came home. He asked me would I come along and join him so we have been out on tour and we were over playing in Camden, in London last week, said Sean.He continued: ldquoHe signed with a record label called Buddy Records and they got it all sorted for us to go in and record with Abbey Road, so we were recording our new single lsquoCall My Name.rsquoWith the new single due to release on Spoty at the end of next week, Sean said: ldquoWersquove got it all nearly ready to go so therersquos just a few mixes that need to be done.Talking about the recording day, Sean said: ldquoWe were in early morning and we were just straight into it, I never really got thinking about it and about midday we took a walk around the building and seen all the big studios.ldquoWe recorded in the Gate House studio and we went into Studio Two and Studio Three to do wee bits of sample and background vocals. That was where The Beatles, Ed Sheerin and Adele all wouldrsquove recorded in as well. So it was just madness, he added.During the recording of the single Sean played his great grandfatherrsquos fiddle, an instrument which has a tale of its own to tell. Sean explained: ldquoMy great grandfather had ordered this fiddle in  before the First World War broke out and hersquod sent the money with the order. Basically then the war broke out and the fiddle didnrsquot turn up so he thought all was lost. As soon as the war was finished in , the fiddle arrived at the door. He couldnrsquot believe it. So I took it with me to Abbey Road and the song we were recording was a slow song, and therersquos a lovely deep tone out of the fiddle so I took it with me.ldquoIt was my grandadrsquos father and my grandad was delighted that I took it with me, he added.When asked how he first met Rory, Sean explained that it was through his dad, Conor Magee. He said: ldquoRory was in a band way back years ago called The Revs and they wouldrsquove been doing sets at the likes of Slane Castle. My dad is a sound engineer, and he done the sound for The Revs about  years ago. We were going over to Lanzarote and I didnrsquot know Rory at all and dad had messaged him to seehe would get me up for a song in the Island Bar.Sean continued: ldquoHe got me up and shortly after that he sent me a message to seeI wanted to do a couple of gigs over in Lanzarote. He asked me thenI wanted to go out on tour with him when he was home. So it came out of nowhere really.Sean has since been touring with Rory and the Island for the last six months, travelling all over Ireland and the UK. Talking about their upcoming gigs, Sean said: ldquoWersquove Germany for St. Patrickrsquos weekend and America then in April, over to New York.He added: ldquoWe also have a local gig in Charliersquos Bar on March .

They were immensely popular and Brett Young was prime minister Stanley Baldwin’s favourite contemporary novelist because he waxed lyrical about ‘the same wholesome, consensual rural values’ in which the prime minister passionately believed.Although Brett Young’s work has some affinity with Radio Four’s ‘The Archers’, scarcely anyone reads him today.There is an analogy with Lydia Mary Foster. She published novels and short stories depicting the inhabitants of her native Tyrone in the same era. Her work was very successful and popular in Ulster in the s and s and even attracted approval in both London and Dublin. Today she is little read and is probably largely forgotten, except by a small but select band of enthusiasts and specialists. Although the title of one of her books – ‘Tyrone among the Bushes’ – has entered popular consciousness, few people necessarily appreciate its source.Born in , Lydia Foster grew up a daughter of the manse at Newmills, near Coalisland. James Foster was the third minister of that church and wrote an account of the  Revival which he welcomed ‘with open arms and entered into with joyous enthusiasm’.Lydia Mary was the second daughter and the fourth of six children, and was named after her mother. Lydia and her elder sister Jane Wallace and younger sister Susan Margaret Elizabethwere probably educated at home and then at Miss Black’s school in Holywood where they boarded during the week.Bessie attended Victoria College, Belfast, before entering Trinity College, Dublin, where she matriculated in  and from which she graduated in Ancient and Modern Languages in .Newmills offered few opportunities for well-educated young women, so after Bessie’s graduation the three sisters established a private school, the Ladies’ Collegiate School, Balmoral, in Belfast. The school began le in Myrtlefield Park, then moved to  Lisburn Road and finally to  Maryville Park. The school was attended by local girls but also attracted some boarders who, with their teachers, attended Malone Presbyterian Church on Sundays and sat in Pew No.  in the gallery.The school flourished for  years until the death of Lydia’s two sisters in the final years of the Great War. Crimes against elderly ‘less likely to be solved’Chapter Chat: Workshops setting a vision for Royal Black moving forward Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Bessie died on Christmas Day  and Jane on October  of the following year. Lydia became increasingly deaf and turned to writing, publishing short stories, plays, verse and poetry in magazines such as ‘Ulster Parade’, a light-hearted collection of local writing, enough to provide her with a modest income to support her frugal lestyle.Lydia published several books: ‘The Bush that Burned’ , ‘Tyrone among the Bushes’ , ‘Manse Larks’and ‘Elders’ Daughters’ .She had long aspired to write about Newmills Presbyterian Church and le in that part of east Tyrone and ‘The Bush that Burned’ was the realisation of that dream. A best seller, one reviewer enthusiastically observed: ‘We have been awaiting a novelist who knew Ulster le intimately and who could depict it with understanding and sympathy. The author of this novel is the author we have been eagerly expecting.’‘The Bush that Burned’ even merited favourable mention in London journals, an accolade rarely accorded to local writing in that era. The Dublin-based Irish Independent perfectly accurately described it as a ‘brilliant portrayal of Presbyterian le’. Dr John T Carson notes that the book ‘saw the funny side of things connected with the Presbyterian meeting house, such as the precentor’s tuning fork, the long- handled collecting ladels, the old smokey coke stoves, the boots that squeaked down the aisles on Sunday mornings and the romances that affected the heads of the daughters of the manse.’While ‘Tyrone among the Bushes’ is a collection of poetry and shorter pieces of prose, ‘Manse Larks’ depicts le in Newmills manse. If ‘Manse Larks’ focused on the lives of the daughters of the manse, ‘Elders’ Daughters’, her second substantial volume, endeavoured to perform the same the same service for ‘elders’ daughters’ – young women whom she understood perfectly and about whom she was equally well informed. ‘Elders’ Daughters’ was described as ‘good ... but hardly as fresh as the first’. Nevertheless, it was an immediate success.She remained in Belfast, living at  Maryville Park until the early s, latterly along with another single lady who was traumatised by the Belfast blitz in . Foster herself, almost totally deaf and living several miles away from the raids’ epicentre , took the raids completely in her stride. Dr Carson informs us: ‘When the bombs began to fall the visitor’s calm was shattered and she came near to panic. Lydia’s deafness was an advantage and she took command of the situation. They took refuge under the dining-room table and in order to restore the shattered nerves of her companion Lydia read to her from the th Psalm.’By the time Lydia was completing ‘Elders’ Daughters’ she was unwell and unable to write, so she dictated the concluding chapters to her niece at ‘Hollowbridge’ – her niece’s home near Hillsborough. Lydia died there on December   but she lived long enough to see two editions of ‘Elders’ Daughters’ sell out before her death.She was buried in accordance with her wishes in the graveyard of Newmills Presbyterian Church. In the words of John C Arnold KC: ‘Newmills received her back to rest almost within sound of the river that gurgles down under the viaduct to find its home in Lough Neagh, and well within sound of the Psalms when they float out through the open window. She would rather be there than in the nave of Westminster Abbey.’A new edition of ‘The Bush that Burned’, with an introduction by Dr Colin Walker, footnotes to the text and a glossary, was published in  and is available on Amazon.try catch            ..

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So I think some of my colleagues will also be considering their positions following that announcement.Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson said she was expecting to meet with the new group later this week, having spoken with some of its members inrecent days.Ms Swinson said the Lib Dems were ready to ldquowork with the new grouping, though she played down suggestions of a formal pact between the parties, insisting she had no fixed blueprint for how they should co-operate.ldquoI think we need to be working together with the Independent Group MPs but we need to find a  way of doing that and Irsquom open-minded about how that looks, Ms Swinson told BBC Radio rsquos Today programme.ldquoI want to approach this with a very very open mind, potentially to have radical change. It is not very often we get a moment to break up the broken political system and we have that moment now.Askedthat could include Lib Dems agreeing not to stand candidates against the  TIG MPs, Ms Swinson said: ldquoI donrsquot think we should be taking any of these things off the table.She added: ldquoI will welcome anyone to the Liberal Democrats who shares my liberal values, and obviously I want more people to join the Lib Dems.ldquoBut I am not going to be petty about this and suggest that I am not going to work with somebody who shares many of my values just because for whatever reason they donrsquot feel that they can join my party..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: New Independent Group of MPs to meet for first time article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

When he was in his s, Pat McKeever took over the farm after the death of his father Peter, who had run an apple canning business on the site. Pat said: “My daddy was one of three brothers who used to can apples. They’d get the apples from the local orchards, peel them and can them. Daddy then started growing his own apples and supplying the fresh market and the cider markets.”Now Pat’s son, and Peter’s grandson – also called Peter – is the third generation farmer who is set to carry on the business. Pat’s we Catherine and their four daughters also have integral roles to play as the craft cider making end of the agri-business continues to grow.Pat, Catherine and Peter McKeever of Long Meadow FarmLong Meadow started off with two craft cider drinks in  before introducing a mulled cider and a cider aged in oak barrels, some of which had been used in the original apple canning business. Over the past two years the company has branched out into flavoured ciders, apple juice and apple cider vinegar – famed for its health benefits.Catherine said: “I know everything goes through a bit of a fad, but I think the craft ciders are still holding their own. The mindset of cider has changed with craft ciders. “A lot of people would have associated cider in their younger days – maybe when they were at university – as a cheap drink you can buy in big quantities and get a hit off.“But that wasn’t craft cider. People are prepared to pay that little bit extra for the quality that comes with craft cider.“We’re using all our own fruit. We make it in smaller quantities so it can hold all the flavours, that’s the way we want to keep it. We only use hand-picked fruit, not any that has fallen on the ground.”Of the harvesting process, Pat said: “We would have between  to  pickers. They would come the third week in July and do a bit of summer pruning.Resurfacing works on A Portadown Road, ArmaghBrexit and data protection - will firms still have to comply with the new EU GDPR  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"“Once that’s finished, in August they start into the picking of the apples, that goes right through to the end of October, first week in November.“The picking season we call it the nine weeks of hell. It’s your livelihood. You are depending on that fruit.“We harvest approximately , tonne of apples yearly.”Catherine explained how the orchard came to be illuminated: “A man called Walter Holt came to the farm last year to buy some apple cider vinegar. “I got talking to him and he gave me his card and told me what he did – an outdoor lighting artist.“I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I think the seeds had been sewn. I played about with it in my mind for a long time that it could be something we could work with.”Walter Holt and his assistant Orlanda Delaforce spent a total of  hours working on the installation of the lighting scheme.Walter commented: “The challenge on this particular scheme was working with smaller trees in an orchard setting. It’s a compact area and our solution was to develop a one way circular trail. “We tried to have as much creative iety as possible, implementing dferent approaches to dferent trees, with the whole colour scheme carefully thought out.”The light display is accompanied by music composed by Londonderry musician Sharon Graham.Catherine said: “We chose Valentine’s week for the treelumination launch as we felt it was a novel way in terms of adding to the romance of walking in the moonlight, but it’s by no means just for couples, it’s designed very much as a family experience for everyone.“I think we all have a vision of apple orchards complete with apple blossom or an abundance of fruit.“This illuminations event highlights the orchards in a totally dference perspective – a raw natural resting state before the cycle of growth begins.”The light show – designed by Walter Holt of Travelling Treeluminations – is the first of its kind to be held in an orchard environment and will open to the public from today until Saturday, from pm to pm each evening at  Loughgall Road.Entry is £ per adult and £ for children. A family ticket for two adults and two children costs £.Visitors will be given the opportunity to see the pressing and blending facilities on the farm as well as taste some of the products.Artisan food will be on sale as well as some free refreshment including tea, coffee and hot chocolate. Set to benefit from the four-day event is local charity ‘Katie-Rose’s Journey’.For more information on this week’s illumination event and other aspects of the farm go to www.longmeadowcidertry catch  TrendingThree vehicle crash near PortadownPartner and child were lsquomaking too much noisersquoDiscovery of mans body sparks murder probeJail sentence for man who spat and screamed at hospital staffConcern as disabled woman who carrys oxygen tank slapped with parking ticket          ..

Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pmcg.jpg","title":"ryder cup legend to address belfast leadership conference","story":"Posted on Friday February  by Ulster Business Ryder Cup legend Paul McGinley has been revealed as one of the key speakers at a leadership event taking place in Belfast next month.
